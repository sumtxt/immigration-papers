    "abstract": "Integration has become a dominant framework in the governance of immigration, indicating what states and “host societies” expect immigrants to do and how to behave to become accepted members of the receiving country. Critical scholarship has argued that this creates an unequal normative burden: “immigrants” are subject to integration demands while “native citizens” are exempt. Despite this widely acknowledged “integration dispensation”, the asymmetry of expectations has not been empirically tested. In this article, we conceptualize immigrant integration in terms of social norms – expectations regarding the social, economic, cultural, and political participation – and develop a theory of a migration bias: the idea that these norms are stronger for immigrants than for society at large. We test this hypothesis using a population-based survey experiment in Switzerland. Our results provide evidence for a migration bias, particularly in the social dimension of integration and expectations concerning respect for laws and constitutional values. However, this bias is context-dependent, appearing in the German-speaking part of Switzerland but not in the French-speaking counterpart. These findings provide novel insights into the popular understanding of immigrant integration and the nature of social norms and citizenship in diverse societies.",

    "abstract": "Education is widely believed to predict attitudes toward immigration, but what causal relationship underlies this descriptive pattern? This research employs three distinct natural experiments and considers genetic factors to triangulate this relationship: Study 1 analyses discordant monozygotic twins; Study 2 assesses the impact of a Swedish education reform; and Study 3 analyses dizygotic twins with the use of a polygenic index for education, a DNA-based measure for genetic predispositions toward education. The results indicate that education does modestly promote open views toward immigration (Study 1), yet the reform’s effect remains uncertain (Study 2). Study 3 offers direct evidence of the effects of genetic predispositions and suggests that genetics related to education may influence attitudes beyond achieved educational attainment. These findings confirm the positive impact of education while pointing to the combined influence of genetic and social pathways in shaping immigration attitudes.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed a proliferation of initiatives aimed at reducing partisan polarization in the United States. Many of these initiatives focus on promoting civil dialogue across partisan lines and fostering tolerance for diverse political perspectives. While these are laudable goals, we argue that emphasizing civility and tolerance may have the adverse unintended consequence of diminishing citizens' willingness to engage in conflictive conversations about normatively important but politically divisive subjects. We focus on two especially prominent (but contentious) preoccupations of contemporary American politics: combating racism and countering the spread of misinformation. We test our theory through an experimental evaluation of two scalable online depolarization workshops. Our results suggest that the workshops mitigated affective polarization and negative partisanship among a subsample of participants drawn from a nationally representative voter database. Consistent with our theory, however, the workshops also appear to have diminished these same participants' willingness to confront false or racist speech when doing so would require conflictive conversations with out‐partisans. We conclude by considering the complex practical and normative implications of our results.",

Research often focuses on deterrence, leading to a neglect of bureaucratic boundaries within borders. This article unpacks the unrecognized importance of people‐processing capacity: a state's ability to render forced migrants legible by categorizing them as cases and selecting those perceived as desirable victims. Due to the heterogeneous nature of claims and the agency of migrants, rendering migrants as cases is a deeply complicated process. Using a historical‐institutionalist framework, the article explores the role and historical development of people‐processing capacity through a comparison of the evolution of modern migration control in Canada and Sweden, two states with similar trajectories of capacity‐building but different guiding ideas for migration policy. The results trace the institutional roots of deservingness, reveal different ideals of vulnerable and adaptable refugees, and theorize how persistent governance problems emerge from classification systems intended to order migration.",

    "abstract": "Experiences with public benefits can shape recipients’ feelings (belonging) and enactment of citizenship (e.g., political, civic, or economic behaviors). However, we know less about how undocumented and lawful permanent resident (LPR) immigrants fit within this paradigm. This study, based on in-depth interviews with forty working-poor undocumented and LPR Latina immigrant mothers, reveals striking ways in which mothers described the meanings they attached to the benefits received and the social processes their experiences with benefit programs informed. Many mothers described an increased sense of self-efficacy as mothers and as immigrants, expanded notions of government responsiveness, and shifts in how they understood the citizenship (broadly conceived) of their children based on their experiences with benefits. This was even reported among mothers who used programs often seen as stigmatizing or who had challenges arise in petitioning for benefits. Moreover, mothers conveyed these meanings spurring legal, economic, and civic behavioral adaptations in their lives, deepening their engagement as citizens. They also described how the meanings derived from benefits use produced changes in their parenting practices, describing structuring their children’s time and engagement with institutions, as well as fostering reasoning skills and attitudes meant to benefit their children’s long-term integration. I term such practices concerted citizenship cultivation. For children with legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing comfort and entitlement within US institutions, socializing interactions with authority figures, and promoting expanded engagement in society. For children who lacked legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing positive identity and deepening engagement within protective institutions.",

    "abstract": "Existing research has shown that horizontal inequalities arising from comparisons between ethnic groups can promote ethno-nationalist conflict. However, these studies have largely focused on comparison between groups within the same country. In this article, we extend this perspective and study comparisons with kin groups abroad and how they affect the risk of ethnic civil war. In particular, we address the fact that many groups have several kin groups abroad, all of which could serve as reference points for comparison. Drawing on insights from social psychology, we argue that the comparisons made with different groups involve distinct motivations, which can yield varying degrees of stimulus related to the outbreak of ethno-nationalist conflict. Our results suggest that comparisons with kin groups abroad – especially the best (most well-off) groups, as well as the nearest or median groups – are salient in increasing the propensity for conflict incidence. Moreover, groups that are relatively well-off and thus prone to downward comparisons, especially when the group is wealthier than all of its transnational kin groups, are much less likely to fight. A novel finding emerges: relative poverty in comparison with transnational kin does not appear to exacerbate the potential for conflict, but relative wealth does appear to attenuate it.",

However, these efforts remained limited and partially failed. Based on a qualitative industry study, our findings shed light on the dynamics and reasons behind this path of 'limited solidarity' in a union stronghold. While much of the literature on (barriers to) more solidaristic employment relations has focused on union identities and activities, our article seeks to highlight how production systems and employer strategies shape union revitalisation strategies and influence their success or failure. To sustain the transnationalised, export-oriented production model, shipyards rely on an increasingly professionalised ecosystem of subcontracting firms that help them recruit, train, and flexibly deploy pools of cheaper peripheral labour. While some of the literature points to regulatory policies that facilitate employers' regime-shopping strategies, our findings show that today, paradoxically, it is precisely the context of increased re-regulation of European cross-border labour markets that leads firms to develop more opaque contractual relations, creating additional obstacles and sobering experiences for organised labour. Substantial improvements are not to be expected from more power for workers alone but also require fundamental reforms.",

    "abstract": "Housing scarcity is a widespread social and economic problem. Prior studies have attributed this scarcity to local control over land use, which has been seen as making policy makers more responsive to small electorates. Challenging this argument, we suggest that smaller jurisdictions have stronger incentives and greater capacity to raise tax revenue by building housing. Therefore, expanding the electorate that policy makers are responsive to could lead to a more restrictive housing policy. To explore this question empirically, we study a reform that consolidated some Danish municipalities, increasing the size of their jurisdiction. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that consolidated municipalities issue fewer permits and complete less housing than smaller jurisdictions. Our study thus shows that politicians permitted more housing when they were accountable to a smaller electorate. This upends conventional wisdom and suggests that local control need not be at odds with more liberal land use policy.",

    "abstract": "America’s major political parties have been riven by ideological factions which contest for power partly through partisan primaries. Ideological factions can only be grounded in voting behavior to the extent that primary voters are consistently ideological across primaries. Yet, prior research has relied overwhelmingly on cross-sectional analyses. This paper thus provides new, over-time evidence on the extent of ideological voting in partisan presidential and Senate primaries. It first uses population-based panel data which measures the same respondents’ presidential primary preferences in 2008, 2016, and 2020 to investigate ideology’s role in stabilizing primary vote choices. Across pairs of primaries, over one third of respondents prefer candidates representing different ideological factions within the same party. To extend these analyses to Senate races and address concerns about sampling biases, it also draws on precinct-level returns in five states’ primaries (2008–2024). Evidence from these varied sources points to one conclusion: ideological considerations influence primary voting, but their modest association with vote choice and limited over-time stability leaves substantial room for other factors.",

    "abstract": "This article seeks to understand the public opinion formation among women of color in America. How do identity-based factors, such as linked fate with women of color (WoC), shape political evaluations? Expanding on social identity theory and intersectionality frameworks, we investigate the political influences of WoC identification and WoC intersectional linked fate. We argue that intersectional linked fate represents a deeper sense of shared experiences and interconnected outcomes across race and gender, making this both a conceptually distinct construct and a politically consequential extension of WoC identity. Further, we theorize that women of color’s perceptions of intersectional linked fate drive their cross-racial support for real-world WoC in politics. We analyze data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey to test how intersectional linked fate correlates with evaluations of prominent WoC political figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Michelle Obama among Black, Latina, and Asian American women. Our findings reveal that intersectional linked fate has a stronger and more consistent influence on these political evaluations than either WoC identity or racial linked fate, fostering solidarity and support for WoC politicians across racial boundaries. The results highlight the critical role of intersectional linked fate in shaping public opinion with important implications for understanding future elections, especially as candidates, politics, and the electorate continue to diversify in the United States.",

This study examines ideological shifts between young men and women in 32 European countries from 1990 to 2023, and how they are linked to societal levels of gender equality. Using data from several Eurobarometer surveys, we analyse the left–right self-placement of over 466,089 individuals aged 20–29. Using graphical analyses, regression models and age-period-cohort (APC) analyses, we find heterogeneity in the extent and development of ideological youth gender gaps. In 14 countries, the ideological positions of women and men are almost equal. In seven countries there is a modern youth gender gap in political ideology, with women being more left-wing than men. This has remained roughly stable since the 1990s. In 11 countries, a modern youth gender gap has emerged and/or widened over time. Finally, we find that modern youth gender gaps tend to be greater in countries with greater gender equality. The mainly small to moderate gender gaps—with important differences between countries—contradict the narrative of a strong and uniform shift towards a modern gender gap in political ideology among young adults.",

While political scientists have begun to study both phenomena in earnest, with exceptions, they have been unable to fully wrestle with either. We suggest that this incomplete understanding is the result of the discipline's problematic racial history. At the time of its founding in the late nineteenth century, political science provided a eugenicist justification for the very hierarchies and segregations that are now under scrutiny. Race was understood to be the quintessential subject of social scientific inquiry. After World War II, political scientists rejected eugenics and instead focused on defending democracy against totalitarianism. In doing so, they relegated racism to an ideological/irrational phenomenon and thus as extraneous to the core concern of the discipline. In this Annual Review of Political Science article, we refract the discipline's contemporary and historical concerns with democracy through the lens of racial politics to better equip scholars with tools to examine and critically diagnose contemporary politics.",

However, existing accounts largely study personality’s links to liberal-conservative divisions on social and economic issues. We know far less about its attitudinal influences when politics is organized around other issue domains, particularly ethnonational conflicts. Addressing this gap, we examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits, policy preferences, and political orientation in Israel, where the main ideological cleavage involves the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Using original survey data, we find that the known relationships with social and economic attitudes operate only partly and more weakly in this context. Unlike these domains, conflict-related preferences in Israel correlate primarily with greater conscientiousness, largely through authoritarian tendencies. General Left-Right orientations mimic this relationship, reflecting conflict-related views rather than social or economic inclinations. These findings expand the scope of current debates about personality and political attitudes and underscore the importance of national ideological contexts for future research.",

    "abstract": "How well can individuals’ parental background and previous life experiences predict their mid-life socioeconomic status (SES) attainment? This question is central to stratification research, as a strong power of earlier experiences in predicting later-life outcomes signals substantial intra- or intergenerational status persistence, or put simply, social rigidity. Running machine learning models on panel data to predict outcomes that include hourly wage, total income, family income, and occupational status, we find that a large number (around 4,000) of predictors commonly used in the stratification literature improves the prediction of one’s life chances in middle to late adulthood by about 10 percent to 50 percent, compared with a null model that uses a simple mean of the outcome variable. The level of predictability depends on the specific outcome being analyzed, with labor market indicators like wages and occupational prestige being more predictable than broader socioeconomic measures such as overall personal and family income. Grouping a comprehensive list of predictors into four unique sets that cover family background, childhood and adolescence development, early labor market experiences, and early adulthood family formation, we find that including income, employment status, and occupational characteristics at early career significantly improves models’ prediction accuracy for mid-life SES attainment. We also illustrate the application of the predictive models to examine heterogeneity in predictability by race and gender and identify important variables through this data-driven exercise.",

Employing most-different case studies of the Five Star Movement/Lega coalition in Italy and Viktor Orbán’s government in Hungary, we find that populists do bend to market pressure but that this “disciplining effect” does not stem primarily from foreign investors. Rather, it was the inaction of domestic investors in bond auctions that caused these governments to reverse course on headline economic policies. Because domestic investors served as both governments’ “buyers of last resort,” they needed to maintain their favor amidst foreign capital flight.",

It argues that, in the context of decentralization reforms, the accumulation of policy instruments has undermined national steering capacities and intensified territorial inequalities. Decentralization accelerated accumulation by decoupling policy formulation from the costs and administrative responsibilities of implementation, shifting these burdens onto subnational governments. The resulting proliferation of instruments politicized implementation, as local authorities confronted capacity‐driven trade‐offs between adhering to national directives and pursuing local policies, while simultaneously gaining opportunities to innovate and build coalitions with non‐state actors. Consequenty, local governments in economically dynamic areas could strategically leverage policy accumulation to advance their interests, whereas those in less affluent regions faced administrative overload. By adopting an institutional perspective on policy instruments, this paper shows how accumulation research can foreground the political consequences of accumulation, which increasingly shape the problem‐solving capacities and legitimacy of modern states.",

Some scholars argue that post-treatment items should never be used as covariates because the treatment could bias the measurement of those items and disrupt experimental randomization. Other scholars argue certain items—specifically sensitive questions measuring prejudice—should not be administered pre-treatment. They argue if asked pre-treatment, these items may prime respondents in ways that will influence how they engage with the experiment treatment, thereby affecting the overall outcome of the experiment. Using evidence from four studies (two original collections) that vary the placement of sensitive items—pre-treatment, post-treatment, or in a separate wave—we find little evidence that the placement of sensitive items influences the measurement of those items, the experimental outcomes, nor heterogeneously affects the outcome conditional on the treatment. However, we find the placement of sensitive items inconsistently affects the experimental outcome by interacting with both the measurement of the items and the experimental treatment condition. Overall, we find these measures to be robust to where they are administered. It may be best to place items pre-treatment to preserve randomization. If researchers have reason to include sensitive moderators post-treatment, they should transparently discuss this choice and the anticipated trade-offs.",

Employing a difference-in-difference approach, I find that the presence of new mosques in a kecamatan (district) correlates with increased exclusionary attitudes toward non-Muslims. To a more limited extent, the presence of more mosques also correlates with a greater emphasis on religious similarity in voting decisions. Further exploratory analysis suggests that mosques serving as channels for information and communication within the community plays a more significant role in producing these effects than their functions in enhancing religiosity or reinforcing religious identity.",

We review research that assesses the potential causes of the rise of place-based polarization, including political–economic transformation, racism, ethnocentrism, and the growing salience of social issues. We also consider its consequences, such as increased levels of social polarization and institutional threats to democracy. Most research to date has focused on individuals, whether to specify rural identity and its correlates or to probe public opinion and political behavior. We recommend that scholars broaden their scope of inquiry to include factors at the meso and macro levels by studying the interplay between place and institutions, public policies, and organizations as well as broader political, economic, and social developments. This will entail attention to change over time. We suggest that scholars resist cordoning off this research area into rural studies and instead engage with broad questions about the functioning of American democracy.",

    "abstract": "While research on advanced democracies highlights unequal political responsiveness favoring the affluent, less is known about such bias in authoritarian regimes without competitive elections. This paper analyzes how wealth affects bureaucratic responsiveness in an authoritarian context. By matching administrative data on municipal service records with apartment complex-level housing prices in downtown Shanghai, we show mixed findings on unequal responsiveness. Local governments resolve issues faster for residents in wealthier areas, which indicates a priority bias. However, residents in poorer areas receive equally positive resolutions as those in richer neighborhoods. Using interviews and a formal model, we interpret these mixed findings as an outcome of the dual mandates street-level bureaucrats face: efficiency pressure and social stability concerns.",

Drawing on his language of capitals and social space, and spotlighting access to and differences within the elite, they have demonstrated mobility to be both multidimensional and fine-grained. This paper seeks to synthesise and broaden these developments, taking the UK as its case study. It uses data from the Labour Force Survey from 2021-23 and a multidimensional class scheme to examine absolute rates of vertical, horizontal and diagonal mobility as well as relative odds and pathways of entry to fractions of the higher class linked to social origins. While the results confirm the importance of how much capital one starts with for limiting vertical mobility, they also reveal clear differences according to the preponderant type of capital people start with, as well as gender and ethnicity, that indicate specific strategies of social reproduction and ascent. I finish by calling for a consolidation and elaboration of a Bourdieusian research programme on social mobility.",

However, systematic inquiries into the experience of being trapped by bureaucratic procedures or state inaction for sometimes multiple years are still lacking. To study the interactions between citizens and the state when long waiting times and significant outcomes are involved, we introduce the concept of administrative limbo. We examine administrative limbo using primary and secondary interview data from the Irish defective concrete block crisis, the Dutch childcare benefits affair, and the Dutch Groningen gas crisis. Findings suggest that experiences of administrative limbo are marked by prolonged and extensive uncertainty, accumulating strain, and negatively impacted life perspectives. We find that the effects of being stuck in administrative limbo are profound, indicating that temporal experiences of inaction and action should be further explored in public administration.",

A preregistered nested-stimuli experiment with a sample of German women provided no support for the role model hypothesis but some support for the adverse effects of sexist attacks.

Despite the increasing union heterogeneity characterising corporativist Southern European countries in particular, inter-union relationships have never been emphasised in previous studies. Our article explores the evolving relational landscape of employee representation and its impact on effective advocacy for low-skilled workers. In conducting a multiple case study research design within the Italian logistics sector, we rely on the concepts of frames and power resources to understand inter-union relationships and their consequences for workers’ concerns. Our results show how grassroot unions and established unions are characterised by deep frame contestation in terms of ideational incompatibility. The studied grassroots union adopted radical frames emphasising labour–capital struggles, while established unions employed a more moderate ’just balance’ approach, pursuing dialogue with firms. In line with this, the grassroots union made much stronger use of structural and associational power resources, while the established union used a wider variety of such resources. This dynamic fostered heightened competition and antagonism between the unions. However, our results also suggest that this antagonism inadvertently resulted in a positive division of labour that revealed a complementarity between different union framings in addressing workers’ concerns.",

To examine this, I ask: How and why does party activism in PRR parties differ between women and men? Based on the literature on gender and party politics, I expect women PRR party members to be less active than men because they have less motivations to participate, are less embedded in party networks, and are more sensitive to stigma. Drawing on original survey data from thousands of members of the League in Italy and the Sweden Democrats, I find that women PRR party members are overall more active than men because they are more embedded in party networks. This surprising result has important implications for our understanding of women’s participation in parties and the growing normalisation of PRR politics.",

    "abstract": "Assessing model uncertainty is crucial to quantitative political science. Yet, most available sensitivity analyses focus only on a few modeling choices, most notably the covariate space, while neglecting to jointly consider several equally important modeling choices simultaneously. In this article, we combine the exhaustive and systematic method of the Extreme Bounds Analysis with the more multidimensional logic underpinning the multiverse approach to develop an approach to sensitivity analyses. This allows us to systematically assess the degree and sources of model uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including the control set, fixed effect structures, SE types, sample selection, and dependent variable operationalization. We then apply this method to four prominent topics in political science: democratization, institutional trust, public good provision, and welfare state generosity. Results from over 3.6 bn estimates reveal widespread model uncertainty, not just in terms of the statistical significance of the effects, but also their direction, with most independent variables yielding a substantive share of statistically significant positive and negative coefficients depending on model specification. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of three distinct approaches to estimating the relative importance of different model specification choices: nearest 1-neighbor; logistic; and deep learning. All three approaches reveal that the impact of the covariate space is relatively modest compared to the impact of sample selection and dependent variable operationalization. We conclude that model uncertainty stems more from sampling and measurement than conditioning and discuss the methodological implications for how to assess model uncertainty in the social sciences.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, widespread support for gender egalitarianism in the household contrasts with the pattern that women continue to do more household labor than men in different-sex relationships. Existing scholarship has revealed the ways in which different-sex couples justify these unequal arrangements. However, we know little about why women do more labor even when they have egalitarian goals and few structural constraints. I address this question by examining whether and how couples attempt to achieve equality and why they so often fail. Data from 40 in-depth interviews with members of 20 cisgender, different-sex, college-educated couples show that, because unequal household labor patterns are so entrenched, having an egalitarian division of labor itself requires work. I theorize and provide evidence for a process I call “equality work,” the work of creating an egalitarian division of labor, which often falls on women. Equality work includes anticipating inequality, strategizing to avoid it, monitoring equality, speaking up about inequality, fixing unequal outcomes, and withholding work. When men don’t strive for equality, women preserve the relationship by doing the labor their partners do not and revising their ideals. Equality work helps us better understand why women do most of the household labor; paradoxically, doing less requires that women work as well. These findings suggest that women are not passively accepting unequal household arrangements but striving to change them.",

We find that propensity to vote for the nationally incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (if hypothetical elections were held on the day of the survey) was negatively correlated with mental stress from routine disruptions in mobility (Week 1); worsening mental health (Week 2); and emotion-focused coping (Week 3). We show that these effects are strongest in BJP-ruled states. We argue that psychological distress shaped political attitudes in the midst of the pandemic and this effect was conditional on the source of distress and moderated by governmental clarity of responsibility.",

In a theory-building exercise, it introduces the concept of negotiation experience to explain why some INGOs develop skills and strategies that allow them to resist donor demands. It also identifies some of the tactics used by experienced negotiators to do so. The findings have implications for who controls and is accountable for humanitarian policy and practice, as well as the abilities of state donors to influence humanitarian behavior.

Concentrated markets are thought to benefit large firms as they earn elevated profits and gain political influence. Antitrust law is the main policy tool to reduce concentration. Calls to strengthen antitrust have come from the political left and the right, yet we know little about public support for such policies. We test how economic, moral, and democratic concerns influence support for antitrust. We find that the public does not respond to the consumer price benefits of antitrust but is moved by arguments invoking concerns for fairness and the importance of maintaining democratic institutions. We find that Republicans and Democrats often respond in divergent ways, with Republicans being less supportive of antitrust when informed that it could punish successful companies, whereas Democrats are more concerned about using antitrust to curb corporate influence. The findings accord with a general concern on the left for limiting business influence in politics and a concern on the right for maintaining business growth.",

Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we investigate how experiences with the one‐child policy affect individuals' intentions under the current pro‐natalist policy. Logistic regression analysis reveals that individuals whose parents complied with the one‐child policy are less likely to intend to have more than one child. This effect is mediated by the weakening of traditional beliefs, such as “raising children for old age” and “continuation of family lineage.” A regression discontinuity design further confirms that individuals with parents subjected to stricter birth control measures exhibit lower intentions to have more children. These findings underscore the significance of intergenerational transmission in shaping citizens' attitudes and highlight the lasting impact of historical policy experiences on contemporary policy outcomes.",

Bringing together sex work, taxation and citizenship studies, this is the first study to consider sex workers' perspectives on the fiscal regimes in which they operate, and how they negotiate and make sense of the challenges they face in relation to paying taxes. We draw on rich qualitative data collected through interviews with sex workers based in three European contexts with different legal and fiscal approaches to sex work: Italy, Portugal and the Swiss canton Geneva. The article reveals that taxes play various roles in the lives, experiences and imaginations of our participants, reflecting different positions and dispositions towards the state, and different aspirations and visions of full citizenship. We show that the ability or inability to pay taxes as a sex worker cannot be separated from the wider legal contexts that grant (or not) rights to sex workers, and from the stigma of sex work that remains pervasive, especially for minoritised groups. Taxation plays an important role in sex workers' lives and in the relationship between sex workers and the state but it can only be one element of many when considering what full citizenship for sex workers might look like.",

The absence of research at the federal level is important because federal policy is essential to expanding gay rights. We overcome issues related to the small number of openly LGBT Members of Congress and the few bills either introduced or receiving votes by examining LGB legislators over 24 years (i.e., 6,425 legislator–Congress pairs) using Human Rights Campaign scores. Using Coarsened Exact Matching, we find a substantively small but statistically significant and consistently positive effect: LGB members of Congress are more supportive of LGBT rights than other members with a similar background and from a similar district.

Governments who seek to meet the demand of the high‐end services sectors pursue a strategy of “open‐ended” higher education expansion. “Targeted” expansion of higher education, instead, is the preferred option for governments in countries characterized by large advanced manufacturing sectors. The latter strategy, however, is hampered by the presence of a partly private higher education system since the ability of governments to successfully pursue their strategies is mediated by the existing institutional framework in the realm of higher education policy. Empirically, the argument finds strong support through three country case studies—Germany, South Korea, and the United Kingdom—that allow to simultaneously leverage a most‐similar and most‐different research design.",

We also hypothesize that women's oversight engagement may depend on the number of female councillors present. Using novel survey data from Italian municipal councillors, our findings indicate that women engage less frequently than men in legislative oversight. Additionally, as the share of female councillors increases, individual female councillors become less likely to engage in oversight activities, likely due to backlash from male colleagues seeking to reassert dominance as women's representation grows.",

We find evidence that providing new information about candidate attributes affects perceptions of electability, with fundraising being most important. Subsequent analysis shows that this effect is largely driven by Republican voters.

I test this theory using rich data on individual legislator careers and parliamentary speech in Denmark across three decades. Consistent with the theory, government membership reduces rhetorical simplicity. Additional analyses suggest the effect is transitory and is driven by constraints on issue emphasis. I then provide experimental evidence of downstream electoral consequences, showing that respondents prefer politicians using simple language. The results enrich our understanding of the costs of governing, the opposition advantage, and the mass grievances fueling populist political movements.",

    "abstract": "The process of development is accompanied by marked changes in the structure of the labor market. We lay out a broad set of stylized features that distinguish labor markets in developing countries from those in richer countries. We organize our review around one particularly striking difference: In poor countries, working-age individuals are employed in wage work only 20–50% of the time. There is evidence that this low wage employment reflects high levels of involuntary unemployment (often masked by self-employment) along with frictions such as wage rigidity, market power, and search-and-matching frictions. At the same time, there is growing documentation that workers prefer self-employment or unemployment to many of the wage jobs that are available to them, especially low-skill work in the formal sector. We offer evidence on several ways in which poverty itself can dampen labor supply, so that low labor supply may itself be an outcome of underdevelopment. Throughout our review, we highlight three core aspects of poverty—missing markets, the importance of social ties, and institutional irregularity—that are relevant for understanding how labor markets change in response to, and help facilitate, the process of development.",

    "abstract": "The Roberts court’s immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",

Yet, we know little about how internet users in authoritarian regimes perceive and experience online political discussion beyond the dominant frame of censorship and surveillance. Based on the first nationally representative survey on internet use in China, this paper examines how citizens view the space for political discussion online and offline and how three types of concerns—repercussions, social desirability, and privacy—shape these perceptions. Results show that Chinese citizens tend to perceive online discussion as more diverse. Those concerned about political repercussions report higher perceived diversity in online discussions, while social desirability concerns correlate with greater perceived diversity in both online and offline settings. Only those concerned for exposure of personal information perceive online political discussion as more uniform. These findings advance understandings of citizen views on political discussion in authoritarian contexts and contribute to broader debates about the role of the internet in political engagement.",

    "abstract": "Regional collectivism has been observed to contribute to better coping with public crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study poses a reverse question: Does the eruption of public crises increase people’s conformity to the collective? To answer this question, we analyzed real-world transactions on Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China), each with a purchase decision and a list of candidates considered before purchasing. Conformity to the collective was measured using two indicators: whether the decision-maker opted for the A) most-sold and B) best-rated options within the candidate option set. The results reveal that both conformity variables were significantly higher in the 10 wk subsequent to January 19, 2020 (when the nationwide COVID-19 crisis erupted in China), than in the 8 wk prior. These shifts were common across subpopulations, regions, and product categories and remained significant after strictly matching across weeks and after using a within-person, longitudinal sample. These shifts were more confidently attributed to the pandemic by further conducting difference-in-differences analyses to compare pandemic-affected regions with their unaffected, comparable counterparts using data from six subsequent regional waves in China. Furthermore, regions with larger increases in conformity during the early stage of the pandemic achieved better antipandemic outcomes. These findings provide real-world evidence for previous theories on behavioral immune systems, terror management, and compensatory control. Additionally, cross-regional comparisons of effect sizes offer exploratory insights into cultural psychology. In summary, these findings capture how human societies dynamically adjust their values to better adapt to unanticipated survival challenges.",

A state’s total gain from a conflict is the difference between the economic gains from the hard front and the cost of forming ideological preferences on the soft front.

In autocracies, where accountability systems are weak or absent, little is known about how citizens judge politicians’ ideologies and their cheating behaviors. Our findings show that Chinese citizens are incapable of identifying political leaders’ ideological orientations; instead, they rely on a cheater-detection mechanism, evaluating leaders based on their adherence to procedural fairness.

Using a staggered difference‐in‐differences design, we analyze individuals' environmental satisfaction from the China Livelihood Survey (2011–2017) across municipalities, while government performance is measured using satellite data and information disclosure timing is sourced from government portals. Findings indicate a consistent relationship between government performance and citizen satisfaction due to information disclosure. Further analyses reveal that this effect is mediated by citizens' information‐seeking behaviors and is particularly pronounced among informationally disadvantaged citizens. This research contributes to understanding the performance–satisfaction relationship in a digital era.",

That raises the question of why only some Radical Left parties have adopted a “flexible” strategy while others have not. This article develops a novel theoretical framework to answer this question, arguing that the strategic choices of Radical Left parties were affected by a set of external conditions - primarily the severity of social and economic conditions and the features of political competition - and internal features - primarily ideological heritage and the degree of party leadership autonomy. Empirically, those findings are based on an extensive in-depth comparative analysis of six Radical Left parties in three countries: Denmark, France, and Spain.",

In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",

Existing large-scale systems of governance such as markets, bureaucracy, and democracy make complex human relations tractable, albeit with some loss of information. AI's major political consequences can be considered under two headings. First, we may treat AI as a technology of governance, asking how AI's capacities to classify information at scale affect markets, bureaucracy, and democracy. Second, we might treat AI as an emerging form of governance in its own right, with its own particular mechanisms of representation and coordination. These two perspectives reveal new questions for political scientists, encouraging them to reconsider the boundaries of their discipline.",

We use semi‐structured interviews and archival data to investigate environmental policy implementation in China, where developmental state logic and regulatory state logic coexist and compete. We found that regulatory state logic increases SLBs' workloads and accountability, while developmental state logic limits their power and resources. These competing institutional logics result in unclear responsibilities, expanding the number of tasks but constraining resources, creating pressure for enforcement officials while providing few rewards. In response, SLBs engage in active and passive coping behaviors.

While it is argued that moral frames are more effective when they invoke strong moral emotions, thus far the relationship between real‐world political moral viewpoints on climate change and the arousal of related emotions, behavior, and attitudes has not been studied. In this paper, we raise the question of whether existing moral climate frames are effective through emotions (“passion”) or through direct moral persuasion (“virtue”). We compare three viewpoints on the causes of and solutions to climate change: the mainstream, the green‐left, and the populist right viewpoint. Grounded in moral foundations and appraisal theory, we conceptualize these viewpoints on the causes and solutions of the climate crisis as moral appeals embedding appraisals to specific emotions. In the next step, we use these specific appeals as input for a 3 × 2 between‐subjects factorial survey experiment with a control condition among a diverse sample of 1708 Dutch respondents, varying the inclusion of presented diagnoses. Our results show that the effectiveness of moral climate change appeals depends on passion, and that widespread climate action is unlikely based on the most prominent political climate messages.",

    "abstract": "In an era increasingly influenced by autonomous machines, it is only a matter of time before strategic individual decisions that impact collective goods will also be made virtually through the use of artificial delegates. Through a series of behavioral experiments that combine delegation to autonomous agents and different choice architectures, we pinpoint what may get lost in translation when humans delegate to algorithms. We focus on the collective-risk dilemma, a game where participants must decide whether or not to contribute to a public good, where the latter must reach a target in order for them to keep their personal endowments. To test the effect of delegation beyond its functionality as a commitment device, participants are asked to play the game a second time, with the same group, where they are given the chance to reprogram their agents. As our main result we find that, when the action space is constrained, people who delegate contribute more to the public good, even if they have experienced more failure and inequality than people who do not delegate. However, they are not more successful. Failing to reach the target, after getting close to it, can be attributed to precision errors in the agent’s algorithm that cannot be corrected amid the game. Thus, with the digitization and subsequent limitation of our interactions, artificial delegates appear to be a solution to help preserving public goods over many iterations of risky situations. But actual success can only be achieved if humans learn to adjust their agents’ algorithms.",

We argue that this equalizing potential is contingent upon the degree of selectivity in accessing and completing a specific educational stage. Specifically, only when a given level becomes less selective, does preschool contribute to increased educational equity. Our evidence unveils two novel insights. On the one hand, the magnitude of returns underwent important changes over time, with more recent periods demonstrating diminished payoffs. On the other, the broadly documented equalizing potential of preschool is a function of the selectivity in accessing each educational level, suggesting that preschool has not always been an equalizing investment.",

This evidence highlights the contingent nature of the turnover–performance relationship, suggesting that government agencies with high turnover may experience fewer delays when organizational structures retain task knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Political meritocracy is the idea that political institutions should aim to empower those people who are particularly well-suited to rule. This article surveys recent literature in democratic theory that argues on behalf of institutional arrangements that aim to realize the ideal of political meritocracy. We detail two prominent families of meritocratic proposals: nondemocratic meritocracy and weighted voting. We then describe and briefly evaluate five potentially important criticisms of political meritocracy related to the coherence of merit as an ideal, the demographic objection, rent-seeking, political inequality, and social peace. We also consider the key ways in which existing electoral democracies create spaces for institutionally meritocratic forms. Finally, we highlight the importance of exploring institutional innovations that allow democracies to effectively incorporate expertise without, at the same time, becoming vulnerable to the criticisms of political meritocracy that we discuss.",

I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",

The list of misconduct is long. It includes, for example, not disclosing sponsored content, withholding negative experiences with promoted products, buying fake followers, and promoting false ideals of beauty. Building on the concept of “dirty work” as a theoretical framework, this article asks which strategies influencers use to soften this moral taint. Qualitative interviews with influencers living in Germany show that they are aware of their negative image in public and use various stigma management strategies. This article offers a perspective that has not yet played a role in the ethics debate about influencers. It asks how influencers, who are often associated with morally questionable practices, immunize themselves against this negative image and find a positive work identity.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the social meaning of softblocking, a practice on social media in which a user blocks and then immediately unblocks another user, causing a mutual unfollowing. This study finds that softblocking highlights that social media users exercise agency in creating imagined affordances through novel use of pre-installed features to do social work. It also discusses what the rise of softblocking suggests about the demand for reciprocity within social media interaction. With a corpus of 96,541 tweets mentioning softblocking from 2009 to 2020 and corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study explores (1) how softblocking is differentiated from pre-packaged affordances, (2) how softblocking is negotiated metadiscursively, and (3) how expectations of reciprocity are addressed by softblocking. I find that users expect sustained interaction and value-sharing with those they are in mutual following relationships with and also expect these relationships to be broken reciprocally. This study argues that softblocking meets the demand for disconnective action in a mutual manner, in line with emerging norms of politeness on social media that see reciprocity as politeness.",

A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",

The Budget Control Act of 2011 implemented a sequester that reduced BAB subsidies by 5.7 to 8.7% each year since 2013. This paper estimates previous and potential future sequestration losses on all outstanding BABs as of the end of 2022. It delves into BAB use and sequestration by two issuers (governments in the state of Texas and City of Chicago). The paper concludes with a discussion of the current state of BABs as it relates to recent litigation and refinancing attempts.

We relate key parameters to factors that differ across societies and over time, including economic opportunities for women, laws that criminalize domestic abuse, and social norms associated with gender equality. We review research associated with these topics to establish what we know and do not know about violence against women in households. While much of this literature is outside of the field of political science, we highlight opportunities for political scientists to contribute to our understanding of how and why domestic violence persists in the world today.",

SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",

This body of research pushes against the narrative that suffrage happened automatically with modernization and the claims that early women voters were apathetic and conservative and did not get what they wanted out of politics. New scholarship reveals how political competition and suffragists’ strategies were key components of suffrage reform and how women, who often cast the largest number of votes in any given context, could shift the balance toward left parties if they were highly mobilized in cities. Finally, a growing body of scholarship has shown how suffrage led to expansions of early welfare state policies. Future work should examine these dynamics in suffrage's second wave and outside of the global North.",

Participants included 264 emerging adult children who were involved in a romantic relationship. Parent interference with the romantic partnership was directly and indirectly associated with turbulence in the parent-child relationship via communication valence. The direct association was conditioned by the family’s conversation orientation and whether the adult child valued the parent’s opinion about their romantic partnership, whereas the indirect association was not. Likewise, parent facilitation was directly and indirectly associated with turbulence via communication valence, though again only the direct association was conditioned by conversation orientation and valuing the parent’s opinion.

Sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement but ultimately damages the credibility of the source, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind news sources sharing misinformation, we model the competition between sources as a zero-sum sequential game, where news sources decide whether to share factual information or misinformation. Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics. We analyze this game through the concept of quantal response equilibrium, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making. The analysis shows that the resulting equilibria reproduce the credibility-opinion distribution of real-world news sources, with hyperpartisan sources spreading the majority of misinformation. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote a more factual information landscape.",

The arrangement of regulator’s social embeddedness matters, independently of market structure. This research leverages the comparison of three countries with markedly different models of electricity governance—Chile, China, and Mexico—to explore how governments manufacture the conditions for robust action in industrial governance. The analysis reveals three distinct forms of reconfiguration of knowledge networks, forming new expert organizations, appropriating expert organizations owned by the industry, and diversifying the nature of knowledge exchange relations.

    "abstract": "Evolution of complexity in human languages has been vigorously debated, including the proposal that complexity can build in small, isolated populations but is often lost in situations of language contact. If it is generally true that small, isolated languages can build morphological complexity over time, but complexity tends to be lost in situations of language contact, then we should find that forms of language complexity that have evolved multiple times will tend to be associated with population size, isolation, and language age. We test this hypothesis by focusing on one particular form of morphological complexity, polysynthesis, where words built from many parts embody complex phrases. By assembling a global database of polysynthetic languages and conducting phylospatial analyses, we show that languages with highly complex word morphology are more likely to have small population sizes, less likely to occur with many other languages in direct contact, and have a greater tendency to be on long phylogenetically isolated lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that languages that evolve in isolation for long periods may be more likely to accrue morphological complexity. Polysynthetic languages also tend to have higher levels of endangerment. Our results provide phylogenetically informed evidence that one particular form of complex language morphology is more likely to occur in small, isolated languages and is prone to loss in contact.",

Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.",

Recent years have seen an outpouring of research on mass mobilization, responding in part to a succession of global revolutionary waves. But this scholarship has flourished despite conceptual dissensus, with works embracing an array of partly overlapping terms (e.g., uprising, rebellion, civil resistance). Revolution offers a clear and tractable way of characterizing the full range of these mass movements, while still allowing for conceptual narrowing with adjectives. It also provides a conceptual link to related literatures on authoritarianism and democratization, which characterize mass-based regime change as one of the main threats dictators face. After making these arguments, I demonstrate the utility of this broad definition by reviewing two active debates regarding different forms of revolution: the relative merits of nonviolent versus violent resistance and the types of democracy emerging from democratic revolution versus elite-led negotiations.",

    "abstract": "r/fundiesnarkuncensored is a Reddit community that monitors and critiques fundamentalist Christian, namely evangelical, content creators. Many members of the community were formerly conservative Christians who have since deconstructed some or all of their beliefs. This study approaches “fundie snarkers,” particularly those who have deconstructed, through the lenses of anti-fandom and affect theory, to deepen our understanding of anti-fandom as a simultaneously ideological and affective phenomenon. Through individual, semi-structured interviews with 20 members of r/fundiesnarkuncensored, we explore the role that “fundie snarking” plays in members’ deconstruction journeys and vice versa. Participants organized content on the subreddit into three categories based on their affective and intellectual responses to that content: petty snark, or superficial critiques that participants find both guiltily pleasurable and frustratingly rude; structural snark, or systemic critiques of fundamentalism that participants universally esteem; and dark snark, or content that participants find too distressing to engage. Taken together, this “structure of snark” reveals the ambiguity of their anti-fandom by emphasizing that participants have empathy for the fundies they criticize and see the subreddit’s ideal purpose as a tool for deconstruction. Ultimately, through our discussion of the gratifications participants obtain through their engagement with the subreddit, we propose an additional form of anti-fandom: cathartic anti-fandom. Cathartic anti-fandom involves the dislike and critique of ideologies, practices, and communities in which the anti-fan formerly participated and/or by which they were harmed. By filtering fundamentalist Christian teaching through critical commentary and making these ideologies laughable, r/fundiesnarkuncensored provides an accessible and enjoyable space for members to unlearn harmful ideologies.",

    "abstract": "The European Union (EU) is making regulatory efforts to allow for the safe integration of drones into civilian airspace through automated means. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/664 concerning unmanned traffic management (a system referred to as “U‐Space”) furthers that commitment. Accordingly, drone operators must avail themselves of automatic traffic‐related “U‐Space services” concerning flight authorization, geo awareness, traffic information, and network identification before entering U‐Space airspace. Using infrastructural analysis, as proposed within Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article shows that while automation is meant to ensure safe traffic, it could also challenge U‐Space safety in at least three ways: by inviting reliability concerns for U‐Space infrastructure; because of the transition from human‐centric to automation‐centric systems; and by being subject to irregularities within the EU's framework. An infrastructural analysis, therefore, helps in unveiling important factors which influence the safety of automated technologies and in critically discussing the role of law in their regulation.",

    "abstract": "The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can generate human-like responses, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. The causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, safeguarding, and more. These results warrant caution in using LLMs as surrogates or for simulating human behavior in research.",

But the threats they face—cuts to federal research funding, assaults on academic freedom, and bans on admitting international students—extend far beyond their campuses. Research universities across the country—large and small, public and private—are grappling with these same pressures. These institutions are behind the breakthroughs that shape daily lives. Undermining them doesn’t just jeopardize higher education, it threatens national and global strength. This means that economic, technological, and intellectual collapse is inevitable if US research institutions fall to federal and state disinvestment.",

We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",

    "abstract": "The claim that war is in decline has gained considerable traction among analysts and policy makers. This review surveys the empirical data as well as the theoretical arguments for a decline of war. It concludes that, while great power wars have declined since 1945, war in general is not necessarily in decline. Critiques of the claim that war is in decline range from the statistical to the anthropological. While war is not necessarily in decline, though, it has changed. Specifically, a major driver of the putative decline of war—international norms, laws, and institutions—has done more to change how war is discussed and presented than whether it is prosecuted. Stronger theories of change are needed in international relations to understand whether these somewhat superficial changes could deepen in ways that produce a true decline in war.",

It argues that these justices have failed to articulate a persuasive rationale as to why exactly the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings and that they have failed to adequately show that history supports their “no-coercion” construction of what constitutes a prohibited establishment. Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text. The court’s use, misuse, and nonuse of history cannot help but give the impression that policy preferences—more than history or the actual original understanding of the First Amendment—have determined recent church-state decisions.",

But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",

    "abstract": "Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an “institutionalist,” indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing institution over his own political preferences. This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",

Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",

    "abstract": "The current Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on issues of executive power differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",

Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",
