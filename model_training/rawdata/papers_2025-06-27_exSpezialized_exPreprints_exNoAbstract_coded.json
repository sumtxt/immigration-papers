    "authors": "Roberto F. Carlos, Hajer Al-Faham, Michael Jones-Correa",
    "abstract": "Throughout his presidency, Trump employed exclusionary rhetoric and implemented policies that targeted Latinxs. Based on prior research on the political effects of co-ethnic group-based attacks, many expected Latinxs to close ranks and mobilize against Trump in 2020. Yet a larger percentage of Latinx voters supported Trump in 2020 than in 2016. Drawing on a representative survey of Latinxs, we examine the characteristics of the Latinx electorate that predicted support for Trump in 2020. Additionally, using a survey experiment fielded before the 2020 election, we find that neither Trump’s exclusionary rhetoric nor his COVID-19 policies harming Latinx communities caused Latinx Trump supporters to defect. Instead, only those already predisposed to support Democrats, but ambivalent about Biden, were moved to punish Trump when informed of his COVID-19 policies negatively affecting their co-ethnics. Our results suggest that the relationship between co-ethnic group-based attacks and Latinx political behavior may be weakening over time.",

    "abstract": "In Europe, the children of migrants often have worse economic outcomes than those with local-born parents. This paper shows that children born in Denmark with immigrant parents (first-generation locals) have lower earnings, higher unemployment, less education, more welfare transfers, and more criminal convictions than children with local-born parents. However, when we condition on parental socioeconomic characteristics, first-generation locals generally perform as well or slightly better than the children of locals. While children of immigrants are more likely to come from deprived backgrounds, they do not experience substantially different outcomes conditional on parental background.

    "abstract": "The empirical base for understanding how cultural and linguistic proximity shape international migration remains limited. Here, we assess how individuals’ migration and return migration behavior differs by own and parental ethnolinguistic affiliation, using Finnish longitudinal population register data that cover the years 1987–2020 (N=1,822,484). Information on two generations allows us to distinguish between Finnish-born individuals with uniform and mixed backgrounds. Finnish and Swedish speakers with mixed backgrounds are particularly informative, because they have similar observable characteristics but differ in mother tongue and thus often attend distinct school systems (either the Finnish-speaking or the Swedish-speaking school system). Results from piecewise constant exponential models reveal a clear ethnolinguistic gradient in the likelihood of migrating, which is magnified for migration to linguistically and/or culturally proximate countries. Swedish speakers with Swedish-speaking parents are the most likely to migrate to Sweden and the other Nordic countries, followed by those with mixed backgrounds. Finnish speakers with Finnish-speaking parents are the least likely to migrate. Patterns for return migration provide the mirror image. The findings remain largely consistent when we control for socioeconomic characteristics and the ethnolinguistic composition of the municipality. These results underscore the important role of ethnolinguistic affiliation in migration behavior.",

    "abstract": "We examine how income taxes affect international mobility and wages. We study a Dutch preferential tax scheme for migrants, which introduced an income threshold for eligibility in 2012. The threshold is low relative to similar schemes in other countries, thereby offering eligibility to migrants with mid-level earnings. We find migration more than doubles closely above the income threshold, while migration below the threshold remains unchanged. These effects appear to be driven by additional migration, while wage bargaining responses are limited. We estimate a migration elasticity ranging from 1.6 to 2.7, somewhat higher than most studies on high-income migrants have found. (JEL H24, H31, J15, J31, J82)",

    "authors": "Kim Angell",
    "abstract": "It is beyond doubt that states everywhere practice discretionary border control. However, in normative political theory, there is vigorous debate about the justifiability of this practice. Some theorists appeal to border crossers’ interest in free movement, envisioning an open borders utopia, while others emphasize the value of collective self‐determination, defending strong border control rights for states. Both perspectives focus on two primary interest‐holders: state collectives and individual border crossers. This analysis offers a novel perspective by arguing that cities—and sub‐state collectives in general—may also have significant interests in immigration policy. Through empirical examples like Europe's “Solidarity Cities” and North American sanctuary cities, the paper argues that cities often possess self‐determination–based rights to protect an additional quota of vulnerable border crossers, beyond those their state protects. This conclusion is surprising because appeals to self‐determination typically defend a state's right to limit migration. Yet, it is one that proponents of the self‐determination view have reason to accept.",

    "abstract": "Which actor identities and social and political cleavages drive public opinion on human rights violations? While in‐group bias is known to influence public responses to government abuses, the relative impact of different identity characteristics has not been directly tested. Building on social identity theory and moral typecasting theory, I use a conjoint survey experiment in the United States of 3,200 respondents to examine the causal effects of in‐group bias across multiple actor identities (perpetrator, target, and elite cue giver) and social and political divides (partisanship, race, religion, and citizenship). Party loyalty to the perpetrator dominates other group identities; simply changing the perpetrator's political identity can be an important determinant for whether respondents oppose violations. Surprisingly, the target's race, religion, and citizenship has mixed impact, and partisan cues have little effect. These findings highlight when group loyalty outweighs human rights concerns and where public demand for government accountability may be reduced.",

    "title": "Cueing Without Parties: Experimental Evidence from Peru",
    "authors": "Nicolás de la Cerda",
    "abstract": "Citizens infer policy information from partisan cues, yet their utility varies cross-nationally. In weakly institutionalized democracies with short-lived political parties and volatile party systems, partisan cues are likely of little heuristic value. I argue that in these contexts, citizens leverage alternative political markers, such as ideological or political movement-related categories, to make sense of the political arena. I test this argument in Peru, a country with an extremely volatile and distrusted party system. Using a survey experiment, I show that political cues significantly influence policy preferences even in the absence of clear and strong partisan brands. Further analysis using causal forest reveals that movement-related political identities are the primary moderators of cueing effects, outweighing traditional factors such as partisanship or ideology. Notably, while non-partisan cues influence attitude formation, only outgroup cues effectively shape preferences. I theorize that this asymmetry could potentially stem from two distinct features of the Peruvian political landscape: deep mistrust in political parties and patterns of affective polarization marked by stronger outgroup prejudice than ingroup favoritism. Overall, this study underscores the importance of alternative forms of political identification in weakly institutionalized party systems, extending existing theories of public opinion formation to diverse democratic settings.",

    "authors": "Albert Falcó-Gimeno, Jordi Muñoz, Roberto Pannico",
    "abstract": "Research on the political consequences of terrorism often finds a rally around the flag effect: terrorist attacks, as other types of threats, tend to produce spikes in popularity and support for the incumbent, as citizens turn to those in power seeking protection. Most research, however, is based on single case studies that analyze very salient attacks from international terrorist organizations. Even if these studies are well identified, the question of generalizability remains, as the studied attacks are often very idiosyncratic. In this paper, we explore the rally around the flag effect in an arguably difficult context: a sustained terrorist campaign held by domestic terrorist groups in a parliamentary democracy (Spain). To overcome the limitations of the single-attack studies, we use a multiple unexpected event approach: we developed a systematic process of matching the occurrence of terror attacks during the fieldwork of official public opinion surveys in Spain, through which we identified 142 valid attack-survey pairs. We find that in the attacked region support for the incumbent increases, on average, around 4 percentage points right after an attack, while support for the opposition decreases in a similar amount. These effects seem to occur mostly for the conservative incumbent and are especially relevant for the attacks that target civilians. We use a survey experiment to provide additional evidence in support for our interpretation of the findings.",

Moral reframing involves designing messages that align with an opponent’s moral convictions with the goal of increasing their willingness to adopt that position. Using lessons from the literature on political psychology, we examine the rhetoric used by legislators supporting and opposing transgender athlete bans in US states to determine how moral reframing was used. We find that the moral convictions of both sides, coupled with their emphasis on in-groups and out-groups, lead legislators to interpret the fundamental principles of the bills differently. This dynamic renders it challenging to reframe moral arguments in a manner that might sway opponents. Additional research is needed to study the efficacy of moral reframing in legislative debates on transgender-related policies.",

Notably, they are expected to soon outnumber Roman Catholics in several low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines whether such episodes of religious minority growth can reshape electoral politics. To address this, I combine novel data spanning over two decades (1994–2018) of Christian evangelicals’ expansion across Brazilian municipalities with indicators of structural changes in electoral politics: voter turnout, competition, polarization, and conservatism. Regression models with unit and year-fixed effects reveal no impact of the evangelical boom on electoral competition and polarization, suggestive evidence of increasing conservatism in recent years, and a clear and robust negative effect on turnout. Regression discontinuity design estimates, leveraging an exogenous and discontinuous growth of Christian evangelicals in Brazil’s rural areas, support these findings. The results suggest that the rise of religious minorities may drive gradual transformations in electoral politics.",

Whereas anxiety is usually treated as a unidimensional emotion, we highlight the multiplicity of socially contingent forms it can assume in response to societal threats. Different anxieties, we posit, can create distinct axes of political competition along which anxious voters exhibit widely varying preferences. We illustrate our argument with unique observational and experimental survey data from Spain’s COVID-19 crisis, showing that individuals anxious about the pandemic’s health consequences favoured parties advocating stringent lockdown restrictions, whereas individuals anxious about its economic disruption preferred parties opposing such measures. Analyzing municipality-level results from Madrid’s 2021 regional election, we additionally provide evidence that COVID-19 boosted support for pro-lockdown parties in areas more exposed to its health effects and support for anti-lockdown parties in areas more exposed to its economic impact. Our findings point to the importance of disaggregating complex emotional states for understanding the determinants of voting behaviour.",

    "authors": "Justine M. Davis, Martha Wilfahrt",
    "abstract": "The global rise of political polarization has generated new insights into how polarization affects political behavior. But political polarization may also shape the dynamics of researching such behavior in the first place. This paper argues that in polarized contexts, asking about party identification (PID) during academic surveys can be highly sensitive. We demonstrate this in sub-Saharan Africa, using three forms of evidence. First, a survey of enumerators in Côte d’Ivoire shows that over 50% feel uncomfortable asking about PID, linking their discomfort to the polarized political climate. Enumerators also believe that such questions reduce honest responses and influence the research encounter itself. Second, data from the Afrobarometer reveals that respondents in polarized countries often self-censor on PID questions more than on traditionally sensitive topics like clientelism, violence, or identity. Finally, interviews and focus groups with Ivorian citizens support these findings, highlighting the sensitivity around PID. These results emphasize that in politically polarized environments, partisanship questions may be uniquely sensitive and impact data quality and the research experience in addition to holding ramifications for political behavior. We conclude with a discussion of implications for survey design and analysis as well as a general call for political scientists to consider what is sensitive, in what context, and for whom when designing surveys.",

This paper revisits the debate, focus- ing on the landlords’ ideological domination of the lower classes and anti-democratic attitudes in estate-dominated areas. We contrast the authoritarian landlordism model with a perspective where inequality fosters leftist mobilization if landlords fail to assert hegemony. Analyzing Prussia and Sweden–often seen as opposites in terms of their ru- ral class structures–we challenge the view of Sweden as egalitarian, showing its agrarian inequality was similar to Prussia’s. Examining within-country correlations between land inequality and electoral support for Conservatives, Nazis, and voter turnout, we find no evidence supporting the authoritarian landlordism model. Instead, our results empha- size the role of popular mobilization in Sweden and landlords’ weakening influence in Prussia.",

In this paper, we study the impact of the United States Mexico City Policy, which—when in place—prohibits the disbursement of United States aid funds to foreign Non-Governmental Organizations that provide information or services related to abortion care. Since its 1984 inception, every Democratic president has rescinded it, while every Republican has reinstated it. While previous global public health studies reveal how the Mexico City Policy has actually increased unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion rates, we argue that these unintended consequences go further than previously understood. We argue that when women lose access to abortion care, they are more likely to lose their lives and suffer life-changing injuries due to violence by their partners. Using global data on United States aid and the health burden caused by intimate partner violence against women in up to 204 countries and territories between 1993 and 2019, we show that the burden of deaths and disability attributed to intimate partner violence increases by approximately 16 percent when the Mexico City Policy is in place.",

Using the digital advertising platform on Facebook, we randomly assign ads to over 90,000 adult American users to estimate the effects of dignity appeals on their likelihood of engaging with content concerning people facing homelessness or incarceration. Consistent with preregistered hypotheses and specifications, we find that adding dignity appeals increases the likelihood of positive reactions to such ads, but only when the vulnerable are considered less “blameworthy” for their situation.",

Armed rebellions are often sustained by outside sympathy and support, which conditions global coordination to end intrastate conflict. Studies on reducing such support largely neglect how the emergence of alternative, nonviolent resistance groups impacts international support for violent resistance. Nonviolent alternatives could plausibly increase support for armed rebellion by legitimizing the cause of resistance or reduce support by delegitimizing the means of violent rebellion relative to nonviolent alternatives. To examine this puzzle, we conducted two online survey experiments across more than 30 countries using a pre-post design to capture changes in attitudes toward a hypothetical violent rebel group before and after the emergence of an alternative resistance group. We randomly vary both the presence and features of the alternative group, including explicitly nonviolent rhetoric, government repression and concessions, and short descriptors meant to signal the alternative group’s capacity to fill psychological needs for agency, justice, and belonging. We find that alternative resistance options consistently reduce support for armed rebellion, including among those originally most supportive of it, and that respondents strongly prefer explicitly nonviolent alternatives, yet neither the material efficacy nor the emotional resonance of those alternatives have a substantial additional effect.",

However in polarized societies, bureaucrats, like citizens, tend to hold divergent perceptions of the threat that politicians’ actions pose to democracy. This, in turn, likely shapes bureaucrats’ responses. We examine this in the context of the attempt by Israel’s extreme right-wing populist government to curtail the powers and independence of the Israeli Supreme Court and replace legal advisors with political appointees (hereafter the “legal overhaul”). We employ a mixed-methods design, combining a survey, interviews, and a focus group with career civil servants, showing that those who perceive the legal overhaul as a threat to democracy are more inclined to exit government and less likely to voice and exert effort at work. These findings are attributed to respondents’ views of the legal overhaul as leading to future politicization, curtailed influence, and a threat to their role as civil servants.",

    "abstract": "Public broadcasting systems are tasked with providing citizens with high-quality information and exposing them to diversity, based on professional autonomy and political independence. In polarised pluralist systems like that of Spain, public broadcasters often face politicisation, and political attitudes are strong predictors of media exposure. In Spain – alongside the national public broadcasting service (RTVE) – several regional broadcasting systems were established by regional governments during the decentralisation of the 1980s to strengthen regional cultural identities and promote minority languages. However, the predictors driving the consumption of these regional broadcasts have remained unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the predictors of exposure to Basque public television (EiTB) over an 11-year period (2009–2020), drawing on four post-electoral studies and covering four Basque regional elections. Through logistic regression analysis, we examine how national identity, Basque nationalism, mother tongue and place of birth predict EiTB consumption, while controlling for variables such as age, sex, education level and ideological position on the left-right spectrum. The findings reveal that voting for Basque nationalist parties and feeling exclusively Basque are the key consistent predictors for EiTB consumption over time. We discuss the normative implications of these findings and argue that the role of Basque public television has fluctuated between cultural promotion and nation building.",

Seven hypotheses of voting behaviour are generated from the extant literature relating voting to socio-economic variables (occupational and educational background), political variables (parliamentary experience, career status, age and electoral marginality) and ideological variables (drawn from survey data on MPs' positions on economic, European and moral issues). These hypotheses are tested using data on voting intentions gathered from published lists of MPs' declarations, interviews with each of the leadership campaign teams, and correspondence with MPs. Bivariate relationships are presented, followed by logistic regression analysis to isolate the unique impact that each variable had on voting. This shows that educational background, parliamentary experience and (especially) attitudes to Europe were the key factors determining voting. The importance of Europe in the contest is particularly instructive: the severe problems for Major's leadership which were caused by the issue can be attributed to, and understood in the context of, the 1990 contest in which he became leader.",

In this paper, we explore the longterm effects of selective repression of local elites on ordinary community members who had not been subject to direct repression. Drawing on the literature on the legacy of violence against civilians, we hypothesize that elite-targeted repression creates a political backlash in the affected communities. Examining the legacy of Nazi-era repression of Catholic clergy in Bavaria we ask whether historical repression against Catholic priests is associated with higher support for Christian Democrats after WWII. We find that municipalities where Catholic priests had been repressed are more likely to vote for Christian Democrats in the post-war elections. The legacy of priest repression on voting behavior persists into the present, although its magnitude wanes overtime. These findings suggest that repression of elites leaves lasting intergenerational legacies on mass political and social behavior.",

    "abstract": "We examine the depreciation of skills among unemployed German workers using a panel of skill measures linked to administrative data. Both the reemployment hazard and reemployment earnings steadily decline with unemployment duration. Indicators of depression and loneliness also rise substantially. However, we find no decline in a wide range of cognitive and noncognitive skills while workers remain unemployed. We find the same pattern in a panel of American workers. The results imply that skill depreciation in general human capital is unlikely to be a major explanation for observed duration dependence in reemployment outcomes.

Building on past research, we theorize four pathways that can link insurgency to social conflict across the border. We use a mixed-methods approach, combining synthetic control models, fixed-effects panel data analyses, and extensive fieldwork across multiple communities, and find clear support for two pathways: insurgents using Ghana as a place for obtaining resources and diverted security forces creating vacuums exploited by bandits. The findings show that research and policy should consider more the interaction across multiple types of violence and varied geopolitical spaces in other susceptible world regions.",

This paper investigates the impact of trade liberalization on political distortions in India. First, using variation in political turnover, we identify that politicians distort resources in favor of politically connected firms. Second, we show that reduced tariffs on input goods significantly decrease the distortionary effect of political connections, as trade reduces firms' dependence on politicians for sourcing inputs. The results suggest a new margin for gains from trade through reduced politically driven misallocation, implying that trade can address a widespread source of productivity losses.

Specifically, it examines how disasters influence fiscal and administrative centralization and how this effect varies with their geographic distribution. We argue that natural disasters act as external shocks that increase institutional centralization and the centralizing effect of disasters is more pronounced when they occur farther from the capital or are widely dispersed. Using data from 84 countries (1962–2018), we find support for both the centralizing impact of disasters and the moderating effect of geographic distribution. Results also reveal variations in the effects across different types of disasters, dimensions of centralization, and time lags reflecting cumulative impacts. Overall, the findings suggest that, contrary to the global trend of decentralization, natural disasters drive national and subnational units toward greater centralization, highlighting the adaptive capacity of modern states in response to environmental shocks.",

    "abstract": "Social mobility scholars have long been interested in estimating the effect of intergenerational mobility, typically measured by differences in the socioeconomic status between parents and offspring, on later-life outcomes of offspring. In a 2022 article “Heterogeneous Effects of Intergenerational Social Mobility: An Improved Method and New Evidence,” Luo proposes a new approach called the mobility contrast model (MCM) to define and estimate mobility effects. We argue that the MCM is inherently flawed due to its reliance on the coding scheme used for the categorical variables of social origin and destination. Specifically, when different coding schemes are applied, the estimands defined in the MCM bear distinct meanings, involve different but equally arbitrary constraints, and sometimes yield contradictory results. Moreover, regardless of the coding scheme, these estimands do not adequately capture the sociological concept of a mobility effect. To illustrate this, we reanalyze the Occupational Changes in a Generation Study data used in Luo’s study, highlighting the inconsistency of results when dummy coding versus effect coding schemes are used.",

However, the causal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper investigates the sources of voter fatigue and hypothesizes that frequent elections make electoral abstention more acceptable to citizens. It tests the main hypothesis via an original pre-registered survey experiment fielded in five countries with a total sample size of 12,221 respondents. The results provide pioneering evidence on the psychological effects of election frequency. They confirm that high election frequency increases the social acceptability of electoral abstention and that this effect is proportional to the number of past elections. It can be equally observed among all major social groups, including politically engaged citizens and those who believe that voting is a civic duty. These findings hold major implications for our understanding of voter turnout and democratic institutional engineering.",

The narrow replication confirms the original findings: outsourcing increases government expenditure, whereas decentralization reduces it, with neither practice affecting employment. The wide replications add nuances: while the long‐term results align with the original study, recent data indicate that outsourcing may have narrowed its cost gap with in‐house delivery, and the cost‐reducing impact of decentralization has partially waned. It suggests that the influences of these NPM practices on public sector size have diminished in recent years. This replication illuminates the temporal complexity and evolving nature of the NPM practices and their impacts on public sector size.",

We implement two natural field experiments in which party activists are randomly informed that canvassing is i) effective at mobilizing voters, or ii) effective for enhancing activists’ political careers. We find no effect of the treatments on activists’ intended and actual canvassing behaviour. The null finding holds despite a successful manipulation check and replication study, high statistical power, a natural field setting, and an unobtrusive measurement strategy. Using an expert survey, we show that the null finding shifted Bayesian posterior beliefs about the treatment’s effectiveness toward zero. The evidence thus casts doubt on two popular hypothesized instrumental drivers of political activism – voter persuasion and career concerns – and points toward expressive benefits as more plausible motives.",

    "abstract": "Conjoint experiments have become popular in political science for studying opinions, attitudes, and preferences on various issues. While the methodological literature discusses two dependent variables—forced-choice and rating outcomes—many studies continue to use (or report) only the former. Additionally, many studies primarily focus on analyzing causal quantities—Average Marginal Component Effects (AMCEs) and do not report the descriptive estimates—Marginal Means (MMs). This article highlights the contingency of results from conjoint experiments on the outcome variable and the estimand used. It calls for the inclusion of the rating outcome and for reporting the MMs alongside AMCEs. As the two outcome variables elicit distinct preferences, it explains how relying solely on one may obscure important findings and limit the insights gained from the experiment. This is particularly consequential for the analysis of MMs. These arguments are demonstrated by replicating and reanalyzing recently published conjoint studies. The article concludes with practical recommendations for applied researchers.",

Although multiple approaches are documented in the literature, political scientists do not know which are used more often. In this paper, I examine how laws are created by studying seven modern landmark laws enacted during various policymaking windows. I use a text reuse approach to recursively trace each policy idea in these enactments to the original version proposed in Congress. My results show that (1) laws vary dramatically in how they are constructed, even within similar bill types; (2) when ideas linger on Congress's agenda, it is usually only for a few years, and (3) about 15% of ideas are added at the end of the legislative process where tracking the sponsor is impossible. These findings highlight the dynamism in bill construction. Among these laws, there is no “typical process,” many members contribute at many stages, and some of the largest, most consequential enactments have portions with unknown origins. The results contribute nuance to our understanding of legislative effectiveness, how it might be measured, and insight into how members engage in the legislative process when they anticipate a policy window opening.",

We argue that in contexts where personal connections to the candidate and investment motivations dominate ideology and partisanship as drivers of donations, two main factors shape donors’ future behaviour: 1) government benefits accrued by donors (for example, contracts) and 2) whether the supported candidate runs again in future elections. Using data from Colombian mayoral elections, a context with no re-election, weak parties, and non-ideological races, we find that donating to the winning candidate reduces the probability of donating in the next election. We further show that, among donors to the winner, those who receive a contract from the municipality are more likely to continue donating than those without contracts. The findings highlight the importance of personal loyalty to the candidate and the fulfilment of donors’ investment expectations determining campaign contributions in non-established democracies.",

This has implications for both gender equity and viewpoint representation. Sampling over 400,000 publications and a similar number of authors, we examine gender differences in several scholarly outcomes including publication count, career survival, coauthor gender, journal status, and mean citation count.

Across municipalities, grandfather–child correlations in education or earnings tend to be larger than the square of the parent–child correlations, suggesting that the latter understate status transmission in the long run. Yet, conventional parent–child correlations capture regional differences in long-run transmission and therefore remain useful for comparative purposes. We further find that the within-country association between mobility and income inequality (the “Great Gatsby Curve”) is at least as strong in the multi- as in the inter-generational case. Interpreting those patterns through the lens of a latent factor model, we find that regional differences in mobility primarily reflect variation in the transmission of latent advantages, rather than in how those advantages translate into observed outcomes.",

This is especially evident in work on Christian nationalism where researchers often make the claim that worship attendance promotes more pro-social or liberal outcomes, while Christian nationalism promotes more conservative and less pro-social outcomes. We demonstrate that this finding—and others like it—represents a new version of an old problem: a particular structure of relationships between variables that can induce sign switches based on suppression effects (Lenz and Sahn in Political Analysis 29(3):356–369, 2021). While we do not encourage skipping controls, some commonly reported results warrant caution. Researchers should generally avoid unconditional claims about attendance encouraging liberalism.

Unlike previous studies from Western Europe, it finds evidence for both mechanisms: pre-election satisfaction correlates with participation, but, simultaneously, voters experience a stronger election-related increase in satisfaction than abstainers. Further analyses reveal that the strong increases in satisfaction are driven by election winners and begin already during the election campaign. Our findings highlight the specificities of the satisfaction-participation link and elections’ legitimizing effects in newer democracies.",

    "abstract": "Foreign reserves provide developing countries with resources for managing the effects of economic shocks and crises. Why do reserve levels vary across the developing world? Political business cycles (PBCs) have been associated with reserve level decreases, as incumbents draw them down to fund policies that provide voters with material benefits before elections. But governments can also obtain capital by borrowing on bond markets, getting the resources needed to fund PBC policy efforts through alternative means. We hypothesize and find that this means global finance conditions the PBC effect on foreign reserve levels. When pre-election global interest rates are high and borrowing is expensive, governments do draw down reserves. But when pre-election global interest rates are low and borrowing is cheap, governments borrow rather than deplete reserves. This helps explain variation in reserve levels, and thus variation in resilience against economic shocks, across developing countries. The study further suggests the importance of accounting for reserve use in studies of PBC effects on debt, adds novel PBC identification strategies to the literature, and signals how the politics of diverse areas of economic policymaking can be affected by global financial conditions.",

Absolute and relative mobility are connected, by definition. Yet, they are not equivalent. Indeed, they often diverge. To illuminate why, when, and for whom such divergence occurs—and why, when, and for whom convergence is possible—this article provides two frameworks for connecting absolute and relative mobility. One framework is formal and one is typological. Both frameworks center micro-level socioeconomic experiences across generations. Illustrative analyses employ these frameworks using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Results suggest that divergent experiences, like upward absolute mobility despite downward relative mobility, may be more common among more advantaged social groups. Future researchers could use the two frameworks introduced here to further advance our understanding of how intergenerational inequalities evolve differently in absolute and relative terms.",

Drawing on updated data from the World Development Indicators and supplemental checks with the International Centre for Tax and Development database, we show that democracies have lagged behind non-democracies in compensating for lost trade tax revenues—even after reforms aimed at expanding income taxes and value-added taxes. In addition to emphasizing ongoing domestic political obstacles in liberalizing democracies, we examine emerging challenges that impede revenue generation in LDCs. We conclude with suggested directions for future research on the politics of revenue generation in LDC democracies, emphasizing how improvements in public goods provision and global tax initiatives could help to end the downward cycle in revenue generation.",

Drawing on nine months of fieldwork in rural Peru, this paper develops a theoretical framework to explain militias’ varied post-civil war trajectories, focusing on their wartime relationships with the military and local communities. I argue that militias with autonomy from the military and strong community ties are more likely to persist and strengthen post-war rural governance. By protecting communities from civil war violence, these militias earn social legitimacy and become institutionalized, prompting their members and local villagers to repurpose them for post-conflict governance roles—an overlooked yet essential trajectory for militias in post-conflict settings. To substantiate my argument, I conduct a comparative historical analysis in Peru’s rural periphery using multiple site-intensive methods, including interviews, archival work, and participant observation. The paper offers insights into the historical legacies of violence, institutional change, and governance in areas with minimal state presence.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",

It argues that exit can function as a form of voice in contexts where other forms of voicing discontent are effectively eliminated by repression. This perspective on exit opens the category of voice to a normative conceptualization, defining it as an expression of civic identity. Acting on this identity in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine leads dissenting citizens either into self-imposed exile or inner exile. The article identifies three key modalities of voice available to dissenting citizens: exit-as-voice, voice-after-exit, and oblique voice. In all these modalities, voice is primarily performative, shaped by the political and ethical constraints that emerge from the interplay between repression and resistance. The article draws on an autoethnography of exit within Russian academia and on accounts of resistance both inside and outside Russia.",

    "authors": "Torvald Falch, Per Selle, Jonas Stein",
    "abstract": "Indigenous politics is different from “normal” politics. It is about power within the state and against the state in which fragmentation is commonly seen as fragility. Political party competition is therefore extremely rare, and interests’ representation is generally not organized through political parties. In this article, we analyze a unique and deviant case – Norway – where Indigenous system-building develops thorough party politics based on internal cleavages. Using unique survey data on Sámi voters ( N = 1134) we show how voters for the Sámi parties are divided on the question of Sámi self-determination and that this has transformed the party system from a “one-party dominant system” towards a two-party system based on an internal cleavage concerning the degree and type of self-determination. This transformation has been made possible by changes in the electoral system, a substantial increase in the Sámi electoral roll and major advancements in Indigenous rights in Norway.",

The experiments exogenously vary short-run returns to educational investments to identify the weight placed on equalizing “opportunity” (child-level investment) relative to maximizing “returns” (total household earnings) or to equalizing “outcomes” (child-level expected earnings). While parents in both experiments place some weight on maximizing returns, they also display a strong preference for equalizing opportunities and are willing to forgo 15–45 percent of their earnings to do so. Parents in higher-income countries also care about equalizing outcomes, while parents in lower-income countries do not. (JEL D63, J12, J13, O15)",

    "abstract": "Previous studies render contradictory evidence linking political repression before and political participation after democratization. This article suggests that the perceived political opportunity conditions the long-term effect of political violence: victims punish the authoritarian successor party only if their district is not dominated by it. This hypothesis is examined through the unique context of Taiwan, where the former authoritarian party KMT is still competitive after democratization. Analysis of a newly published White Terror Dataset including 13,206 victims during the martial law period (1949–1987) shows that, if districts have more White Terror victims, KMT received more votes in KMT-dominated districts and fewer votes in districts without KMT domination. The psychological mechanism is supported by a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 910), showing that the White Terror priming increases KMT’s vote when KMT leads in the poll. The result reconciles previous findings and explains authoritarian successor parties’ resilience in new democracies.",

Some of the challenges they have faced suggest the limits of aspirational politics which is entangled with aspects of authenticity and relatability as well as the political economy of start-up apps and platform capitalisms. I endeavor to understand TikTok’s success in India and also comprehend in what ways Indian short video platforms tried to replicate TikTok’s algorithmic logics and creator/talent acquisition strategies within the cultural context of vernacular creativity in India. The article connects discussions of the popularity of short video platforms with recruitment strategies to tap influential content creators in provincial India. The article contends that while theorizing aspirational politics, it is not enough to study (in isolation) how creators aspire to be more successful and gain more followers and influence. Aspirations are also actively fashioned and nurtured by the platform’s talent scouts, content directors, and studio heads. The Indian government along with corporations also creates aspirational discourses. I conceptualize aspirational politics and entrepreneurial limits in these slippages and ruptures across individual desires and state-corporate-platform discourses of aspiration and entrepreneurship.",

    "abstract": "Democratic backsliding is often accompanied by popular policy innovations which boost the incumbent’s popularity, leaving opposition parties in a difficult electoral position. We analyze the strategies available to the opposition in such contexts through a theoretical discussion of issue-based competition and an exploratory case study of Poland’s main opposition party Civic Platform (PO) during eight years of democratic backsliding under United Right governments. Studying the changing positions of PO in three policy areas (abortion, social policy and national memory and identity), we outline how the opposition can re-position itself to attract votes. We argue that backsliding, because it produces a sense of urgency, incentivizes opposition parties to shift some of their policy positions either towards or away from the incumbent’s – even on issues that are central to their political identity. Because backsliding unleashes an existential conflict that strengthens partisan loyalties, opposition voters tolerate some changes that go against their preferences.",

How has this changed over time? I analyze the national party platforms from the two major American political parties since 1968 to assess when, how, and why the party organizations invoke evidence in their platforms. I introduce two categories for describing usage of evidence in partisan rhetoric: justification —citing evidence to corroborate the logic of existing ideological preferences—and solicitation —advertising interest in having more information to make a future policy decision. Using a novel dataset, I chart the frequency and style of how the two major parties invoke evidence in their platforms. I find stark partisan differences. While both parties primarily use solicitation—a finding that contradicts existing studies of individual political uses of knowledge—Republicans use justification at more than twice the rate of Democrats. I show this pattern accelerating after 1994. I argue that trends in how party organizations reference evidence reflect changes in values, goals, and policy commitments. Far from being neutral indicators of policy effectiveness, evidence is itself the product of and a tool for advancing a party’s agenda.",

Further tests address how the patterns of influence might depend on Taiwan’s polarized political and media landscapes.

    "authors": "Benjamin Braun, Maximilian Düsterhöft",
    "abstract": "In contrast to the “quiet” politics of the pre‐2008 period, macroeconomic policy has become “noisy”. This break raises a question: How do independent agencies designed for quiet politics react when a contentious public turns the volume up on them? Central banks provide an interesting case because while they are self‐professed adherents to communicative transparency, individual case studies have documented their use of strategic silence as a defense mechanism against politicization. This paper provides a quantitative test of the theory that when faced with public contention on core monetary policy issues, central banks are likely to opt for strategic silence. We focus on the most contested of central bank policies: large‐scale asset purchase programs or “quantitative easing” (QE). We examine four topics associated with particularly contested side effects of QE: house prices, exchange rates, corporate debt, and climate change. We hypothesize that an active QE program makes a central bank less likely to address these topics in public. We further expect that the strength—and, in the case of the exchange rate, the direction—of this effect varies depending on the precise composition of asset purchases and on countries' growth models. Using panel regression analysis on a dataset of more than 11,000 speeches by 18 central banks, we find that as a group, central banks conducting QE programs exhibited strategic silence on house prices, exchange rates, and climate change. We also find support for three out of four country‐specific hypotheses. These results point to significant technocratic agency in the de‐ and re‐politicization of policy issues.",

As a result, they argue, contemporary trade liberalizations have posed a danger to democracy by starving it for funds, forcing vulnerable governments to resort to politically unpopular policies. This is an important and provocative argument. However, good evidence contradicts its major premise. This research note critiques some data, presentation, and conceptual problems with the argument. It provides new analyses using the well-curated dataset from the International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD, updated by UNU-WIDER), instead of the authors’ primary data from World Development Indicators . It shows that developing countries–and democracies especially–did not, in fact, suffer a revenue shock. On average, trade taxes constituted only a minor part of their government revenue. While the revenue they provided declined slightly over the period in question, this trend was overwhelmed by variation in other tax and non-tax revenues. As for total tax revenues, a key variable sometimes underemphasized in the book, ICTD data show that they expanded more rapidly in democratic developing countries than in non-democratic ones. Regression analyses with ICTD data also fail to confirm the authors’ finding of a revenue shortfall among developing democracies.",

Our findings, based on data from 152 countries spanning 1972–2020 and a range of econometric strategies, reveal a robust positive relationship between tax haven status and domestic income inequality, with tax havens associated with higher market-income (i.e. pretax and pretransfer) Gini indexes, and estimated postadoption Gini coefficients being larger by an average of 0.54 compared to what would be expected based on global trends, country characteristics, and observable economic factors. We also observe that compensatory tax policies, as well as the type of economic activities attracted by tax havens and their implications for labor markets, seem to mediate this relationship. Our results suggest that low-tax jurisdictions economically harm lower income groups in host countries.",

    "abstract": "When viewed as a response to long-term decline in a party’s core constituency – whether class, religion or language-based – catchall strategies involve the inherent risk of marginalising the party’s core voter without achieving significant and/or sustained electoral renewal. The risk of core shrinkage will not be offset by a durable electoral dividend and the catchall strategy may well feed the very decline it is designed to arrest. Whilst catchall strategies are not the exclusive preserve of any one type of party, the type of party may well affect the likelihood of achieving a catchall performance. Following Kirchheimer, parties based on a ‘specific professional category’s claims’, such as the Swedish Agrarians, cannot realistically aspire to a ‘successful transformation’. Accordingly, this paper considers whether the pursuit of a catchall strategy by an historic, niche agrarian-class party with exceptional regional strength in neighbouring Finland could hope to achieve a ‘catchall performance’. More widely it considers whether a catchall strategy is a realistic option in multiparty systems in which ‘new politics’ parties squeeze the available policy space and multi-dimensional cleavage structures cannot readily be accommodated within a single party.",

In the European Union (EU), a high proportion of legislation appears gridlocked yet is nevertheless adopted. We argue that ideological gridlock is resolved through the supply of and trust in legislative concessions. These are made to uphold supranational cooperation, to use issue linkage, and under “permissive consensus” across EU member states. We test our argument using a new dataset on amendments and repeals of existing EU laws (1999–2015). Our results demonstrate that elites' preferences on supranational cooperation as well as the potential for issue linkage help explain legislative success despite gridlock. High public Euroskepticism decreases the likelihood of compromise because lawmakers fear domestic electoral backlash to EU‐level concessions. We contribute to established debates about legislative bargaining under complexity and propose that politicized cooperation can diminish problem‐solving capacity across federations, multi‐level states, and international organizations.",

Using data from semi-structured interviews, as well as statistical analysis and event observations in the field of tax law in France, we show how the structure of these events and the interactions among experts, in a contested move, shift the burden of predictability onto tax regulators, by expecting them to stabilize rule interpretation to leave room for private actors’ strategic uses of the law.",

AI-based tools have become particularly common in assessment decisions, such as when recruiting employees or admitting students. Calls for transparency and new legislation require organizations to disclose the use of AI assessment tools, thus making people under assessment aware of its use. We investigate whether this shift from human to AI assessment affects people’s behavior during the assessment. We propose that people emphasize their analytical characteristics and downplay their intuitive and emotional ones under AI (vs. human) assessment, a phenomenon we label “the AI assessment effect.” Twelve studies (eight in text and four in the Supporting Information; N = 13,342) document the AI assessment effect and its underlying mechanism: the lay belief that AI prioritizes analytical characteristics in its assessment. Whereas prior work has studied perceptions of AI assessment tools and their productivity gains, the current research demonstrates systematic behavioral changes because of AI assessment. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the psychology of AI and practical insights for organizations using AI assessment.",

We fill this gap by using regression analysis to examine the patterns of policy textual learning evident in the clause similarity of seven environmental statutory policies in China. Within China’s decentralized and multilevel environmental governance, our findings reveal that horizontal policy textual learning is more prominent than vertical learning. Temporal distance negatively impacts policy textual learning, whereas spatial distance, contrary to traditional policy diffusion perspectives, does not universally explain multilevel policy textual learning. Additionally, subsequent versions of policy texts are not necessarily similar to earlier ones, challenging conventional assumptions about the adoption and adaptation of policies over time.",

    "authors": "Cyrus Samii, Ye Wang, Junlong Aaron Zhou",
    "abstract": "We present a method for narrowing nonparametric bounds on treatment effects by adjusting for potentially large numbers of covariates, using generalized random forests. In many experimental or quasi-experimental studies, outcomes of interest are only observed for subjects who select (or are selected) to engage in the activity generating the outcome. Outcome data are thus endogenously missing for units who do not engage, and random or conditionally random treatment assignment before such choices is insufficient to identify treatment effects. Nonparametric partial identification bounds address endogenous missingness without having to make disputable parametric assumptions. Basic bounding approaches often yield bounds that are wide and minimally informative. Our approach can tighten such bounds while permitting agnosticism about the data-generating process and honest inference. A simulation study and replication exercise demonstrate the benefits.",

    "abstract": "Identity construction is a continuous process that permeates all social life. Drawing from intercultural communication scholarship and the Bakhtinian perspective on the construction of the self, we suggest that identity is constructed in talk through the interplay of socially constructed, ideologically imbued similarities and differences and propose the blocking and threading analysis (BTA) method to study this process. Blocking refers to constructing differences and social boundaries, whereas threading creates similarities, unity, and commonality. These practices are intertwined, and we argue that identity emerges from the constant shifts between the two. The four-step analytical process entails identifying positioning, recognizing connected utterances, interpreting blocking and threading, and examining their shifts. We illustrate the analytical force of BTA by an analysis of an extract from a focus group discussion among an interprofessional healthcare team. The method requires further application to different datasets, but it shows promise in terms of bringing new insights into research on identity construction.",

    "abstract": "Daycare management apps – marketed to care centers as a way to streamline operations and improve parent-caregiver communication – have quickly moved from relative obscurity in 2016 to near-omnipresence in center-based childcare. These apps mediate the work of caregiving and are thus a growing aspect of the nexus of cultural anxieties about how to manage reproductive labor, parenting, and gendered expectations of mothering. In this paper, we engage in a close reading of five major daycare apps in the US – Brightwheel, Lillio (formerly HiMama), My Bright Day, Procare, and Tadpoles – to investigate how they structure the experience and labor practices of both parenting and non-parent caregiving. As such, we read the app interfaces as material practices through which parents and caregivers grapple with the contradictions of the care crisis and contemporary conditions of parenting. Throughout this article, we attend to the ways that the technological imaginary unfolds in a specific site within the broader context of caregiving in the United States, ultimately arguing that these apps reflect and reaffirm caregiving practices that align with practices of so-called intensive or transcendent parenting.",

Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen ( N  = 187), we test whether “climbing the social ladder” depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure and then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",

Focusing on the strong blame avoidance incentives faced by politicians in the military intervention setting, I develop a model of the war powers focused on “Loss Responsibility Costs.” It suggests that presidents only risk full-scale war when they have the political cover provided by formal authorization, which forces lawmakers to share responsibility. Smaller interventions, in contrast, are frequently undertaken unilaterally because having the president act alone is consistent with congressional preferences for blame avoidance. Novel sentiment data based on tens of thousands of congressional speeches supports the claim that when the president acts unilaterally, they almost always act alongside lawmaker support, who favor intervention but avoid formally endorsing the endeavor. Altogether, it suggests legislators’ influence over war is stronger than commonly appreciated.",

The relationship between informal power and media visibility remains less understood. This study examines whether central roles in networks of political collaboration—as indicators of informal power—are associated with increased visibility in mainstream news media. We hypothesize that organizations with central roles are more visible in the media because informal power increases their newsworthiness. Using social network methods and Bayesian regressions on survey and media data on organizations involved in climate policy in Finland, we find that central organizations with many collaboration partners receive more media coverage. Other central roles, such as brokerage or coalition leadership, are not associated with media visibility. This study advances knowledge of media visibility by showing that informal power is associated with media visibility, and that some power positions are more important than others.",

This study examines authoritarian propaganda’s efficacy during crises and policy changes when the regime needs it most. We posit that various propaganda strategies, including “hard” and “soft” rhetoric, have significant limitations during crises. Hard propaganda’s heavy-handed slogans could signal regime strength but may also legitimize “rightful resistance” against local authorities, limiting its protest-deterrence effects. Soft propaganda may lose persuasiveness due to presenting contradictory arguments during policy changes. We leverage the turbulent period of China’s COVID policy reversal to conduct an original survey experiment in December 2022. Our findings reveal that pro-reopening hard propaganda weakens its protest-deterrence effects by reinforcing belief in protest righteousness. Moreover, inconsistent soft propaganda lowers public evaluations of China’s COVID response, diminishing its persuasive effects.

    "abstract": "Determining how people behave in contexts governed by social norms can clarify both how norms influence human behavior and how norms evolve. We examined cooperative farming harvest division among the Derung, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking horticultural society in southwestern China. In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution. They also accurately guessed that others shared this preference and would approve of such divisions. Nonetheless, they still followed the prevailing norm of dividing by household. Their self-reported explanation for this behavior was that they desired to follow their traditional practices. Such a normative decision-making algorithm can allow individually consequential norms to persist without costly policing by other group members.",

    "authors": "Vanessa Cheung, Maximilian Maier, Falk Lieder",
    "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) become more widely used, people increasingly rely on them to make or advise on moral decisions. Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is, therefore, important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated these questions by asking a range of LLMs to emulate or advise on people’s decisions in realistic moral dilemmas. In Study 1, we compared LLM responses to those of a representative U.S. sample ( N = 285) for 22 dilemmas, including both collective action problems that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost–benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In collective action problems, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: They usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 ( N = 474, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and documented an additional bias: Unlike humans, most LLMs were biased toward answering “no” in moral dilemmas, thus flipping their decision/advice depending on how the question is worded. In Study 3 ( N = 491, preregistered), we replicated these biases in LLMs using everyday moral dilemmas adapted from forum posts on Reddit. In Study 4, we investigated the sources of these biases by comparing models with and without fine-tuning, showing that they likely arise from fine-tuning models for chatbot applications. Our findings suggest that uncritical reliance on LLMs’ moral decisions and advice could amplify human biases and introduce potentially problematic biases.",

    "abstract": "Movement of pedestrian crowds is ubiquitous in human society. However, it is unclear what dynamical regimes pedestrian crowds can exhibit at different crowd densities, how pedestrians move in these different dynamical regimes, and in which dynamical regime the movement synchronization of pedestrians is most likely to occur. Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics.",

This study contributes to research on hybrid professionalism and identity work by examining how organizational professionals themselves perceive this trend and how they justify their roles within public organizations. Based on a narrative analysis of interviews with 24 organizational professionals in Sweden, we examine how they construct their professional identity in relation to competing institutional logics. We expand the concept of hybrid professionalism by incorporating a public service logic alongside managerial and professional logics. We find that respondents frame their identity around the notion of performing a support function for frontline services. This positioning enables them to rearticulate managerial activities as supportive rather than controlling, thereby presenting their work as a response to bureaucratisation rather than a source of it.",

Scholars of financialization have questioned the possibilities to mobilize pension assets for other (e.g. social or environmental) goals by pointing to the constraining power of financial intermediaries. This article explores potential constraints on pension fund investments through an empirical case study of pension funds in the Netherlands. We show that pension funds’ position between members and financial intermediaries restricts their capacity to act as autonomous investors, albeit in asymmetric ways. Although pension fund boards are required to consider member preferences, knowledge deficits and organizational distance enable them to carve out discretionary space. However, due to regulatory requirements, their autonomy vis-à-vis financial intermediaries is more limited. We illustrate our findings with regards to pension funds’ adoption of sustainable investment.",

    "abstract": "Many governments formed ad hoc scientific advisory committees in the Covid-19 pandemic because they offered the government greater control over policy advice than standing agencies. The difference between ad hoc and standing advisory bodies has been little noted in the literature. High-uncertainty crises demanding expertise and requiring action from the national government increase the value of policy discretion, raising the value of controlling the scientific narrative. An ad hoc body is generally easier to control than a standing body because policymakers have greater liberty to choose its members, specify its mandate, and disband and reconstitute it when needed. Control generally requires either a narrow membership or a narrow mandate. If members cannot be chosen to be reliably aligned with the government or its policy preferences, a narrow mandate will restrain the committee from offering undesired advice or analysis. Our argument builds on the public choice assumption of motivational symmetry: The choices of scientists and politicians are shaped by the same motives and desires that influence individuals in any other sphere of life. Our case studies of Italy, UK, US, Poland, Uganda, and Sweden support our theory.",

Results revealed that 60.3% of the content portrayed at least one value, with achievement, benevolence, and hedonism being the most frequent. Multilevel analyses indicated that SMIs and athletes were more likely to post hedonism and benevolence, while celebrities were more likely to share universalism than SMIs. Most values were represented through low to medium levels of multimodal complexity, and only 15.3% showed post-caption congruence.

It illustrates how we can evaluate political responses to injustice without recourse to such principles and maintains that doing so is a strength of any democratic theory that is committed to giving injustice its due.",

We point to another major use case: the extraction of structured information from unstructured text. Information Extraction (IE) is an established branch of Natural Language Processing, but leveraging the affordances of this paradigm has thus far required familiarity with specialized models. GenAI changes this by allowing researchers to define their own IE tasks and execute them via targeted prompts. This article explores the potential of open-source large language models for IE by extracting and encoding biographical information (e.g., age, occupation, origin) from a corpus of newspaper obituaries. As we proceed, we discuss how sociologists can develop and evaluate prompt architectures for such tasks, turning codebooks into “promptbooks.” We also evaluate models of different sizes and prompting techniques. Our analysis showcases the potential of GenAI as a flexible and accessible tool for IE while also underscoring risks like non-random error patterns that can bias downstream analyses.",

However, this mechanism requires a population to agree on who has good standing and who has bad standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here, we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution for judging reputations: a tax collected from each member of the population. We analyze the possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how strong the incentives against corruption need to be. Our analysis has implications for establishing robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations—and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.",

    "authors": "Fanni Tanács-Mandák, Attila Horváth",
    "abstract": "Following Hungary’s 2010 parliamentary election, the Fidesz–KDNP government, as part of a comprehensive restructuring of the country’s constitutional system, fundamentally modified the electoral system approved in 1989, maintaining the mixed system but introducing a number of significant changes to it. The paper seeks to provide a comparative analysis of the 1989 and 2011 electoral systems, with particular focus on how the ruling parties have adapted the new system to their own advantage. Our study aims to shed light on how an electoral system can be susceptible to manipulation through the application of political reasoning that may appear neutral and “well-intentioned”. Despite retaining the mixed-system framework, the changes resulted in a stable advantage for a single political force.",

    "abstract": "Ideas of “craft” and “craftsmanship” have long been mobilized in middle-class Global North markets to promote the romanticized authenticity of artisanal goods, but what happens when these ideas are applied to industrially-made products? This article analyzes the artisanal imaginaries of the Australian Made Campaign to explore how the campaign taps into the growing cultural desirability of the handmade and the artisanal, and heightened concerns about the future sustainability of mass production. Focusing on the discursive and aesthetic approach of the campaign’s Facebook posts, we show how the campaign contributes to a wider mainstreaming of neo-craft as a dominant mode for promoting production in a national context where onshore manufacturing has long been in decline. We argue that the campaign’s media repertoires work to “domesticate” large-scale manufacturing via emotive appeals to traditional artisanal tropes (“love,” “family,” “care”) to tap into the zeitgeist appeal of locally-specific and knowable scales of production.",

    "authors": "Petter Törnberg",
    "abstract": "The rise of platforms has transformed our understanding of contemporary capitalism, with the critical literature describing how these firms leverage unprecedented digital powers to extract monopoly rents – perhaps even heralding a new form of Feudalism. This paper draws on the literature on financial narratives to examine the role that such stories play within the form of capitalism that they describe, and what this suggests for the role of “hype” in contemporary capitalism. The same stories that for critical scholars appear as menacing threats of “technofeudalism” or “surveillance capitalism” for investors appear as optimistic stories of promising future returns. By driving financial investments, narratives afford platforms very real social and political powers, enabling them to function as a form of self-fulfilling prophecies. The paper argues for a cultural inflection to the political economy of Big Tech – viewing capitalism as neither mechanistic nor rational, but as an expression of a complex interplay between narrative, technology, and economic power. This suggests the need for a critical hype studies , geared at deconstructing the narratives undergirding the technological waves of capitalist pursuits, and examining the broader role of hype in coordinating and directing flows of capital within contemporary financialized capitalism.",

Although plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.",

    "abstract": "Agreeing to elections is generally seen as a key way to settle armed conflict and prevent recurrent violence. However, the transition from violent conflict to nonviolent electoral competition can be fraught with many challenges. Stable electoral competition requires trust in institutions, but trust often takes a long time to develop and is often lacking in post-conflict elections. We argue that UN peacebuilding operations can play an indispensable role in the development of stable electoral institutions through three interrelated ways: reducing political and electoral violence, supporting democratic attitudes and norms of peaceful coexistence, and reinforcing institutional capacity and the rule of law. Using a new measure of the expected quality of elections in post-conflict countries between 1946 and 2012, we show that UN peace missions are associated with better elections and a greater likelihood of successful transitions to electoral competition compared to post-conflict countries without UN involvement. We also find larger differences when the UN is involved in establishing electoral institutions, especially when there is no or limited prior electoral competition, indicating that the UN is effective at assisting the democratization processes in difficult contexts.",

This line of research typically involves highly costly manual annotation of text for manual content analysis, and/or training and validating automated downstream approaches. We examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can detect pro-Kremlin disinformation about the war in Ukraine, focusing on the case of the downing of the civilian flight MH17. We benchmark methods using a large set of tweets labeled by expert annotators. We show that both open and closed LLMs can accurately detect pro-Kremlin disinformation tweets, outperforming both a research assistant and supervised models used in earlier research and at drastically lower cost compared to either research assistants or crowd workers. Our findings contribute to the literature on mis/-disinformation by showcasing how LLMs can substantially lower the costs of detection even when the labeling requires complex, context-specific knowledge about a given case.",

We propose a modular pipeline for the automation of PEA (PAPEA) based on fine-tuned LLMs and provide publicly available models and tools which can be easily adapted and extended. PAPEA enables getting from newspaper articles to PEA datasets with high levels of precision without human intervention.

    "abstract": "Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.",

    "abstract": "Adapting to change is a fundamental feature of human learning, yet its developmental origins remain elusive. We developed an experimental and computational approach to track infants’ adaptive learning processes via pupil size, an indicator of tonic and phasic noradrenergic activity. We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity. These findings demonstrate that infants actively adapt to environmental change, and that early differences in this capacity may have profound implications for long-term cognitive and psychosocial development.",

    "abstract": "The wanghong economy in China adopts unique platform monetization strategies, including social tipping, virtual gifting, advertising, and more prominently, e-commerce. E-commerce wanghong are one type of influencer focusing on pushing sales through e-commerce services and play a pivotal role in integrating e-commerce and social media. Online shopping festivals have recently catalyzed the intersection of wanghong cultures and e-commerce. A typical example is the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which implemented multi-stage promotional activities during online shopping festivals to provide practitioners with expanded business opportunities. Notably, this flourishing integration of e-commerce and wanghong culture is carefully guided by the Chinese government’s unique political agenda and regulatory framework. To study this dynamic interplay between e-commerce wanghong, platforms, and national policies, we explore how e-commerce wanghong become a kind of “platformed wanghong.” Furthermore, we examine how e-commerce platforms change users’ experiences of time during online shopping festivals, which we refer to as “promotional temporalities.” Finally, we investigate the “nesting strategies” employed by e-commerce wanghong during these events, which are intertwined with the platform’s promotional temporalities and must navigate compliance within the national regulatory framework. Our findings shed light on the complex relationship between e-commerce wanghong, platform strategies, state regulation, and audience engagement in the context of platform economy.",

We provide axioms that characterize the ω-weighted Nash bargaining set. Our main result shows that ω-weighted Nash bargaining set payoffs are also the PLE payoffs of the corresponding collective pseudo market with the same utility functions and incomes ω. We define a pseudo core for collective pseudo markets and show that pseudo Lindahl equilibria are in the pseudo core. We characterize the set of PLE outcomes of discrete allocation problems and show that they contain the set of pseudo Walrasian equilibrium outcomes.",

By signaling an ally's commitment to a protégé state, a shared enemy may be deterred from attacking. In light of this signaling logic, secret alliances are puzzling. Because they are not observed, secret alliances by definition cannot achieve deterrence through signaling. So why do states enter into these secret agreements? We argue that alliances may also act as a signal of a state's intentions, potentially undermining deterrence. If a new alliance signals that the members' interests are unaligned with those of a shared enemy, the enemy may be provoked into war. As a consequence, states sometimes want to keep alliance agreements secret. To develop this argument, we analyze a formal model in which states may enter into secret or public alliance agreements. We find that the possibility of secret alliances has general effects on deterrence—possibly undermining the deterrent value of concurrent public alliances.",

Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language.",

We extend the max-min analysis under model ambiguity to incorporate the uncertainty induced by acknowledging that the models used in decision-making are simplified approximations.

This study addresses the long-standing question of whether the first Pacific Islanders transported rice with them from the Philippines across 2300 kilometers of open sea, representing the longest known ocean voyage of the time. During this early period, rice was restricted to special ritual events in the Marianas. The early voyage apparently was planned with provisions of rice at 3500 years ago.",
