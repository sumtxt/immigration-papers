"TITLE: When Panethnic Primes Get Trumped: Unpacking Latinx Voter Preferences in the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election
ABSTRACT: Throughout his presidency, Trump employed exclusionary rhetoric and implemented policies that targeted Latinxs. Based on prior research on the political effects of co-ethnic group-based attacks, many expected Latinxs to close ranks and mobilize against Trump in 2020. Yet a larger percentage of Latinx voters supported Trump in 2020 than in 2016. Drawing on a representative survey of Latinxs, we examine the characteristics of the Latinx electorate that predicted support for Trump in 2020. Additionally, using a survey experiment fielded before the 2020 election, we find that neither Trump’s exclusionary rhetoric nor his COVID-19 policies harming Latinx communities caused Latinx Trump supporters to defect. Instead, only those already predisposed to support Democrats, but ambivalent about Biden, were moved to punish Trump when informed of his COVID-19 policies negatively affecting their co-ethnics. Our results suggest that the relationship between co-ethnic group-based attacks and Latinx political behavior may be weakening over time.",other_topic
"TITLE: Background Matters, but Not Whether Parents Are Immigrants: Outcomes of Children Born in Denmark
ABSTRACT: In Europe, the children of migrants often have worse economic outcomes than those with local-born parents. This paper shows that children born in Denmark with immigrant parents (first-generation locals) have lower earnings, higher unemployment, less education, more welfare transfers, and more criminal convictions than children with local-born parents. However, when we condition on parental socioeconomic characteristics, first-generation locals generally perform as well or slightly better than the children of locals. While children of immigrants are more likely to come from deprived backgrounds, they do not experience substantially different outcomes conditional on parental background.

"TITLE: Ethnolinguistic affiliation and migration: evidence from multigenerational population registers
ABSTRACT: The empirical base for understanding how cultural and linguistic proximity shape international migration remains limited. Here, we assess how individuals’ migration and return migration behavior differs by own and parental ethnolinguistic affiliation, using Finnish longitudinal population register data that cover the years 1987–2020 (N=1,822,484). Information on two generations allows us to distinguish between Finnish-born individuals with uniform and mixed backgrounds. Finnish and Swedish speakers with mixed backgrounds are particularly informative, because they have similar observable characteristics but differ in mother tongue and thus often attend distinct school systems (either the Finnish-speaking or the Swedish-speaking school system). Results from piecewise constant exponential models reveal a clear ethnolinguistic gradient in the likelihood of migrating, which is magnified for migration to linguistically and/or culturally proximate countries. Swedish speakers with Swedish-speaking parents are the most likely to migrate to Sweden and the other Nordic countries, followed by those with mixed backgrounds. Finnish speakers with Finnish-speaking parents are the least likely to migrate. Patterns for return migration provide the mirror image. The findings remain largely consistent when we control for socioeconomic characteristics and the ethnolinguistic composition of the municipality. These results underscore the important role of ethnolinguistic affiliation in migration behavior.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: Tax Incentives for Migrants with Mid-level Earnings: Evidence from the Netherlands †
ABSTRACT: We examine how income taxes affect international mobility and wages. We study a Dutch preferential tax scheme for migrants, which introduced an income threshold for eligibility in 2012. The threshold is low relative to similar schemes in other countries, thereby offering eligibility to migrants with mid-level earnings. We find migration more than doubles closely above the income threshold, while migration below the threshold remains unchanged. These effects appear to be driven by additional migration, while wage bargaining responses are limited. We estimate a migration elasticity ranging from 1.6 to 2.7, somewhat higher than most studies on high-income migrants have found. (JEL H24, H31, J15, J31, J82)",immigration_topic
"TITLE: States, cities, and border control: Do sub‐state collectives have a right to protect vulnerable people on the move?
ABSTRACT: It is beyond doubt that states everywhere practice discretionary border control. However, in normative political theory, there is vigorous debate about the justifiability of this practice. Some theorists appeal to border crossers’ interest in free movement, envisioning an open borders utopia, while others emphasize the value of collective self‐determination, defending strong border control rights for states. Both perspectives focus on two primary interest‐holders: state collectives and individual border crossers. This analysis offers a novel perspective by arguing that cities—and sub‐state collectives in general—may also have significant interests in immigration policy. Through empirical examples like Europe's “Solidarity Cities” and North American sanctuary cities, the paper argues that cities often possess self‐determination–based rights to protect an additional quota of vulnerable border crossers, beyond those their state protects. This conclusion is surprising because appeals to self‐determination typically defend a state's right to limit migration. Yet, it is one that proponents of the self‐determination view have reason to accept.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: Unpacking the role of in‐group bias in US public opinion on human rights violations
ABSTRACT: Which actor identities and social and political cleavages drive public opinion on human rights violations? While in‐group bias is known to influence public responses to government abuses, the relative impact of different identity characteristics has not been directly tested. Building on social identity theory and moral typecasting theory, I use a conjoint survey experiment in the United States of 3,200 respondents to examine the causal effects of in‐group bias across multiple actor identities (perpetrator, target, and elite cue giver) and social and political divides (partisanship, race, religion, and citizenship). Party loyalty to the perpetrator dominates other group identities; simply changing the perpetrator's political identity can be an important determinant for whether respondents oppose violations. Surprisingly, the target's race, religion, and citizenship has mixed impact, and partisan cues have little effect. These findings highlight when group loyalty outweighs human rights concerns and where public demand for government accountability may be reduced.",other_topic
"TITLE: Cueing Without Parties: Experimental Evidence from Peru
ABSTRACT: Citizens infer policy information from partisan cues, yet their utility varies cross-nationally. In weakly institutionalized democracies with short-lived political parties and volatile party systems, partisan cues are likely of little heuristic value. I argue that in these contexts, citizens leverage alternative political markers, such as ideological or political movement-related categories, to make sense of the political arena. I test this argument in Peru, a country with an extremely volatile and distrusted party system. Using a survey experiment, I show that political cues significantly influence policy preferences even in the absence of clear and strong partisan brands. Further analysis using causal forest reveals that movement-related political identities are the primary moderators of cueing effects, outweighing traditional factors such as partisanship or ideology. Notably, while non-partisan cues influence attitude formation, only outgroup cues effectively shape preferences. I theorize that this asymmetry could potentially stem from two distinct features of the Peruvian political landscape: deep mistrust in political parties and patterns of affective polarization marked by stronger outgroup prejudice than ingroup favoritism. Overall, this study underscores the importance of alternative forms of political identification in weakly institutionalized party systems, extending existing theories of public opinion formation to diverse democratic settings.",other_topic
"TITLE: Voters rally around the incumbent in the aftermath of terrorist attacks: evidence from multiple unexpected events during surveys
ABSTRACT: Research on the political consequences of terrorism often finds a rally around the flag effect: terrorist attacks, as other types of threats, tend to produce spikes in popularity and support for the incumbent, as citizens turn to those in power seeking protection. Most research, however, is based on single case studies that analyze very salient attacks from international terrorist organizations. Even if these studies are well identified, the question of generalizability remains, as the studied attacks are often very idiosyncratic. In this paper, we explore the rally around the flag effect in an arguably difficult context: a sustained terrorist campaign held by domestic terrorist groups in a parliamentary democracy (Spain). To overcome the limitations of the single-attack studies, we use a multiple unexpected event approach: we developed a systematic process of matching the occurrence of terror attacks during the fieldwork of official public opinion surveys in Spain, through which we identified 142 valid attack-survey pairs. We find that in the attacked region support for the incumbent increases, on average, around 4 percentage points right after an attack, while support for the opposition decreases in a similar amount. These effects seem to occur mostly for the conservative incumbent and are especially relevant for the attacks that target civilians. We use a survey experiment to provide additional evidence in support for our interpretation of the findings.",other_topic
"TITLE: Does the growth of religious minorities transform electoral politics? Evidence from the evangelical boom in Brazil
ABSTRACT: Christian evangelicals now represent a significant share of the global population. Notably, they are expected to soon outnumber Roman Catholics in several low- and middle-income countries. This paper examines whether such episodes of religious minority growth can reshape electoral politics. To address this, I combine novel data spanning over two decades (1994–2018) of Christian evangelicals’ expansion across Brazilian municipalities with indicators of structural changes in electoral politics: voter turnout, competition, polarization, and conservatism. Regression models with unit and year-fixed effects reveal no impact of the evangelical boom on electoral competition and polarization, suggestive evidence of increasing conservatism in recent years, and a clear and robust negative effect on turnout. Regression discontinuity design estimates, leveraging an exogenous and discontinuous growth of Christian evangelicals in Brazil’s rural areas, support these findings. The results suggest that the rise of religious minorities may drive gradual transformations in electoral politics.",other_topic
"TITLE: Varieties of Anxieties: Disaggregating Emotion and Voting Behaviour in the COVID-19 Era
ABSTRACT: How does anxiety influence voting behaviour? Whereas anxiety is usually treated as a unidimensional emotion, we highlight the multiplicity of socially contingent forms it can assume in response to societal threats. Different anxieties, we posit, can create distinct axes of political competition along which anxious voters exhibit widely varying preferences. We illustrate our argument with unique observational and experimental survey data from Spain’s COVID-19 crisis, showing that individuals anxious about the pandemic’s health consequences favoured parties advocating stringent lockdown restrictions, whereas individuals anxious about its economic disruption preferred parties opposing such measures. Analyzing municipality-level results from Madrid’s 2021 regional election, we additionally provide evidence that COVID-19 boosted support for pro-lockdown parties in areas more exposed to its health effects and support for anti-lockdown parties in areas more exposed to its economic impact. Our findings point to the importance of disaggregating complex emotional states for understanding the determinants of voting behaviour.",other_topic
"TITLE: Can Development Programs Counter Insurgencies? Evidence from a Field Experiment in Afghanistan †
ABSTRACT: We exploit a randomized controlled trial conducted between 2007 and 2011 to identify the effect of Afghanistan's largest local governance and development program on the strength of the insurgency. We find that the program reduced violence, improved economic outcomes, and increased government support in interior regions of the country, but increased violence in villages close to the Pakistani border, where foreign insurgents were more numerous. The results suggest that development programs can be effective in suppressing locally driven insurgencies, but may be counterproductive where insurgents are not reliant on the local population for support.

"TITLE: Understanding the Sensitivity of Party Identification Questions in Polarized African Contexts
ABSTRACT: The global rise of political polarization has generated new insights into how polarization affects political behavior. But political polarization may also shape the dynamics of researching such behavior in the first place. This paper argues that in polarized contexts, asking about party identification (PID) during academic surveys can be highly sensitive. We demonstrate this in sub-Saharan Africa, using three forms of evidence. First, a survey of enumerators in Côte d’Ivoire shows that over 50% feel uncomfortable asking about PID, linking their discomfort to the polarized political climate. Enumerators also believe that such questions reduce honest responses and influence the research encounter itself. Second, data from the Afrobarometer reveals that respondents in polarized countries often self-censor on PID questions more than on traditionally sensitive topics like clientelism, violence, or identity. Finally, interviews and focus groups with Ivorian citizens support these findings, highlighting the sensitivity around PID. These results emphasize that in politically polarized environments, partisanship questions may be uniquely sensitive and impact data quality and the research experience in addition to holding ramifications for political behavior. We conclude with a discussion of implications for survey design and analysis as well as a general call for political scientists to consider what is sensitive, in what context, and for whom when designing surveys.",other_topic
"TITLE: Domestic Causes, Global Consequences: The US Mexico City Policy's Global Impact on Intimate Partner Violence
ABSTRACT: How does donor domestic ideology and partisan politics shape the lives of people in aid-dependent countries? In this paper, we study the impact of the United States Mexico City Policy, which—when in place—prohibits the disbursement of United States aid funds to foreign Non-Governmental Organizations that provide information or services related to abortion care. Since its 1984 inception, every Democratic president has rescinded it, while every Republican has reinstated it. While previous global public health studies reveal how the Mexico City Policy has actually increased unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion rates, we argue that these unintended consequences go further than previously understood. We argue that when women lose access to abortion care, they are more likely to lose their lives and suffer life-changing injuries due to violence by their partners. Using global data on United States aid and the health burden caused by intimate partner violence against women in up to 204 countries and territories between 1993 and 2019, we show that the burden of deaths and disability attributed to intimate partner violence increases by approximately 16 percent when the Mexico City Policy is in place.",other_topic
"TITLE: The value of dignity appeals: evidence from a social media experiment
ABSTRACT: In recent decades, activists and leaders of government and nongovernment organizations have increasingly and explicitly called for greater attention to human dignity in their efforts to promote pro-social relations. In this study, we investigate whether appeals to this core human value actually influence how individuals act with regard to those who might be otherwise ignored or neglected. Using the digital advertising platform on Facebook, we randomly assign ads to over 90,000 adult American users to estimate the effects of dignity appeals on their likelihood of engaging with content concerning people facing homelessness or incarceration. Consistent with preregistered hypotheses and specifications, we find that adding dignity appeals increases the likelihood of positive reactions to such ads, but only when the vulnerable are considered less “blameworthy” for their situation.",other_topic
"TITLE: Nonviolent alternatives reduce external support for rebel groups: Evidence from two cross-national survey experiments
ABSTRACT: How do nonviolent alternatives affect international support for violent rebel groups? Armed rebellions are often sustained by outside sympathy and support, which conditions global coordination to end intrastate conflict. Studies on reducing such support largely neglect how the emergence of alternative, nonviolent resistance groups impacts international support for violent resistance. Nonviolent alternatives could plausibly increase support for armed rebellion by legitimizing the cause of resistance or reduce support by delegitimizing the means of violent rebellion relative to nonviolent alternatives. To examine this puzzle, we conducted two online survey experiments across more than 30 countries using a pre-post design to capture changes in attitudes toward a hypothetical violent rebel group before and after the emergence of an alternative resistance group. We randomly vary both the presence and features of the alternative group, including explicitly nonviolent rhetoric, government repression and concessions, and short descriptors meant to signal the alternative group’s capacity to fill psychological needs for agency, justice, and belonging. We find that alternative resistance options consistently reduce support for armed rebellion, including among those originally most supportive of it, and that respondents strongly prefer explicitly nonviolent alternatives, yet neither the material efficacy nor the emotional resonance of those alternatives have a substantial additional effect.",other_topic
"TITLE: Career Civil Servants’ Socially Embedded Responses to Democratic Backsliding
ABSTRACT: Recent studies portray civil servants as potential guardians against populist attempts to undermine liberal democracy. However in polarized societies, bureaucrats, like citizens, tend to hold divergent perceptions of the threat that politicians’ actions pose to democracy. This, in turn, likely shapes bureaucrats’ responses. We examine this in the context of the attempt by Israel’s extreme right-wing populist government to curtail the powers and independence of the Israeli Supreme Court and replace legal advisors with political appointees (hereafter the “legal overhaul”). We employ a mixed-methods design, combining a survey, interviews, and a focus group with career civil servants, showing that those who perceive the legal overhaul as a threat to democracy are more inclined to exit government and less likely to voice and exert effort at work. These findings are attributed to respondents’ views of the legal overhaul as leading to future politicization, curtailed influence, and a threat to their role as civil servants.",other_topic
"TITLE: Between cultural promotion and nation building: Analysing the drivers of Basque public television consumption over a decade
ABSTRACT: Public broadcasting systems are tasked with providing citizens with high-quality information and exposing them to diversity, based on professional autonomy and political independence. In polarised pluralist systems like that of Spain, public broadcasters often face politicisation, and political attitudes are strong predictors of media exposure. In Spain – alongside the national public broadcasting service (RTVE) – several regional broadcasting systems were established by regional governments during the decentralisation of the 1980s to strengthen regional cultural identities and promote minority languages. However, the predictors driving the consumption of these regional broadcasts have remained unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the predictors of exposure to Basque public television (EiTB) over an 11-year period (2009–2020), drawing on four post-electoral studies and covering four Basque regional elections. Through logistic regression analysis, we examine how national identity, Basque nationalism, mother tongue and place of birth predict EiTB consumption, while controlling for variables such as age, sex, education level and ideological position on the left-right spectrum. The findings reveal that voting for Basque nationalist parties and feeling exclusively Basque are the key consistent predictors for EiTB consumption over time. We discuss the normative implications of these findings and argue that the role of Basque public television has fluctuated between cultural promotion and nation building.",other_topic
"TITLE: The British Conservative Party and Europe: The Choosing of John Major
ABSTRACT: This article provides an empirical analysis of voting behaviour in the second ballot of the 1990 Conservative leadership contest that resulted in John Major becoming party leader and prime minister. Seven hypotheses of voting behaviour are generated from the extant literature relating voting to socio-economic variables (occupational and educational background), political variables (parliamentary experience, career status, age and electoral marginality) and ideological variables (drawn from survey data on MPs' positions on economic, European and moral issues). These hypotheses are tested using data on voting intentions gathered from published lists of MPs' declarations, interviews with each of the leadership campaign teams, and correspondence with MPs. Bivariate relationships are presented, followed by logistic regression analysis to isolate the unique impact that each variable had on voting. This shows that educational background, parliamentary experience and (especially) attitudes to Europe were the key factors determining voting. The importance of Europe in the contest is particularly instructive: the severe problems for Major's leadership which were caused by the issue can be attributed to, and understood in the context of, the 1990 contest in which he became leader.",other_topic
"TITLE: Insurgency, Border Contiguity, and Social Conflict in Neighbor Countries
ABSTRACT: This study investigates how an insurgency in one state can intensify social conflict in a bordering state, focusing on the 2015 Burkina Faso insurgency and its impacts on northern Ghana. Building on past research, we theorize four pathways that can link insurgency to social conflict across the border. We use a mixed-methods approach, combining synthetic control models, fixed-effects panel data analyses, and extensive fieldwork across multiple communities, and find clear support for two pathways: insurgents using Ghana as a place for obtaining resources and diverted security forces creating vacuums exploited by bandits. The findings show that research and policy should consider more the interaction across multiple types of violence and varied geopolitical spaces in other susceptible world regions.",other_topic
"TITLE: Nature Made the State: Exploring the Effect of Disasters on Centralization
ABSTRACT: This study explores the institutional consequences of natural disasters on the distribution of authority between national and subnational governments. Specifically, it examines how disasters influence fiscal and administrative centralization and how this effect varies with their geographic distribution. We argue that natural disasters act as external shocks that increase institutional centralization and the centralizing effect of disasters is more pronounced when they occur farther from the capital or are widely dispersed. Using data from 84 countries (1962–2018), we find support for both the centralizing impact of disasters and the moderating effect of geographic distribution. Results also reveal variations in the effects across different types of disasters, dimensions of centralization, and time lags reflecting cumulative impacts. Overall, the findings suggest that, contrary to the global trend of decentralization, natural disasters drive national and subnational units toward greater centralization, highlighting the adaptive capacity of modern states in response to environmental shocks.",other_topic
"TITLE: Understanding Voter Fatigue: Election Frequency and Electoral Abstention Approval
ABSTRACT: The existing literature shows that frequent elections depress electoral participation and contribute to the global decline in voter turnout. However, the causal mechanisms remain unclear. This paper investigates the sources of voter fatigue and hypothesizes that frequent elections make electoral abstention more acceptable to citizens. It tests the main hypothesis via an original pre-registered survey experiment fielded in five countries with a total sample size of 12,221 respondents. The results provide pioneering evidence on the psychological effects of election frequency. They confirm that high election frequency increases the social acceptability of electoral abstention and that this effect is proportional to the number of past elections. It can be equally observed among all major social groups, including politically engaged citizens and those who believe that voting is a civic duty. These findings hold major implications for our understanding of voter turnout and democratic institutional engineering.",other_topic
"TITLE: A Replication of “Did New Public Management Matter? An Empirical Analysis of the Outsourcing and Decentralization Effects on Public Sector Size”
ABSTRACT: This manuscript replicates and extends the work of Alonso et al. focusing on the effects of New Public Management practices—outsourcing and decentralization—on public sector size in terms of government expenditure and employment. The narrow replication confirms the original findings: outsourcing increases government expenditure, whereas decentralization reduces it, with neither practice affecting employment. The wide replications add nuances: while the long‐term results align with the original study, recent data indicate that outsourcing may have narrowed its cost gap with in‐house delivery, and the cost‐reducing impact of decentralization has partially waned. It suggests that the influences of these NPM practices on public sector size have diminished in recent years. This replication illuminates the temporal complexity and evolving nature of the NPM practices and their impacts on public sector size.",other_topic
"TITLE: Political Activists are Not Driven by Instrumental Motives: Evidence from Two Natural Field Experiments
ABSTRACT: Are political activists driven by instrumental motives such as making a career in politics or mobilizing voters? We implement two natural field experiments in which party activists are randomly informed that canvassing is i) effective at mobilizing voters, or ii) effective for enhancing activists’ political careers. We find no effect of the treatments on activists’ intended and actual canvassing behaviour. The null finding holds despite a successful manipulation check and replication study, high statistical power, a natural field setting, and an unobtrusive measurement strategy. Using an expert survey, we show that the null finding shifted Bayesian posterior beliefs about the treatment’s effectiveness toward zero. The evidence thus casts doubt on two popular hypothesized instrumental drivers of political activism – voter persuasion and career concerns – and points toward expressive benefits as more plausible motives.",other_topic
"TITLE: Changing the lens: The contingency of results from conjoint experiments on the outcome variable and the estimand
ABSTRACT: Conjoint experiments have become popular in political science for studying opinions, attitudes, and preferences on various issues. While the methodological literature discusses two dependent variables—forced-choice and rating outcomes—many studies continue to use (or report) only the former. Additionally, many studies primarily focus on analyzing causal quantities—Average Marginal Component Effects (AMCEs) and do not report the descriptive estimates—Marginal Means (MMs). This article highlights the contingency of results from conjoint experiments on the outcome variable and the estimand used. It calls for the inclusion of the rating outcome and for reporting the MMs alongside AMCEs. As the two outcome variables elicit distinct preferences, it explains how relying solely on one may obscure important findings and limit the insights gained from the experiment. This is particularly consequential for the analysis of MMs. These arguments are demonstrated by replicating and reanalyzing recently published conjoint studies. The article concludes with practical recommendations for applied researchers.",other_topic
"TITLE: The (Sometimes Untraceable) Origins of Policy Ideas in Congress: An Analysis of Seven Landmark Laws
ABSTRACT: Research on lawmaking suggests enactments are constructed in various ways. Although multiple approaches are documented in the literature, political scientists do not know which are used more often. In this paper, I examine how laws are created by studying seven modern landmark laws enacted during various policymaking windows. I use a text reuse approach to recursively trace each policy idea in these enactments to the original version proposed in Congress. My results show that (1) laws vary dramatically in how they are constructed, even within similar bill types; (2) when ideas linger on Congress's agenda, it is usually only for a few years, and (3) about 15% of ideas are added at the end of the legislative process where tracking the sponsor is impossible. These findings highlight the dynamism in bill construction. Among these laws, there is no “typical process,” many members contribute at many stages, and some of the largest, most consequential enactments have portions with unknown origins. The results contribute nuance to our understanding of legislative effectiveness, how it might be measured, and insight into how members engage in the legislative process when they anticipate a policy window opening.",other_topic
"TITLE: How Do Electoral Outcomes Affect Campaign Contributions? The Role of Personal Loyalty and Investment Motives
ABSTRACT: How do electoral outcomes affect campaign contributions? We argue that in contexts where personal connections to the candidate and investment motivations dominate ideology and partisanship as drivers of donations, two main factors shape donors’ future behaviour: 1) government benefits accrued by donors (for example, contracts) and 2) whether the supported candidate runs again in future elections. Using data from Colombian mayoral elections, a context with no re-election, weak parties, and non-ideological races, we find that donating to the winning candidate reduces the probability of donating in the next election. We further show that, among donors to the winner, those who receive a contract from the municipality are more likely to continue donating than those without contracts. The findings highlight the importance of personal loyalty to the candidate and the fulfilment of donors’ investment expectations determining campaign contributions in non-established democracies.",other_topic
"TITLE: Women climate scientists are connected, productive, and successful but have shorter careers
ABSTRACT: Scholars have long been concerned about gender representation in scientific research but there has been little work on gender differences in participation and performance in climate science, a field that engages with both male-majority disciplines (e.g., geosciences, engineering) and female-majority disciplines (e.g., life sciences, medical science). This has implications for both gender equity and viewpoint representation. Sampling over 400,000 publications and a similar number of authors, we examine gender differences in several scholarly outcomes including publication count, career survival, coauthor gender, journal status, and mean citation count. We find men and women are similarly productive, successful, and connected, though women have shorter research careers and thus fewer papers. We also find gender homophily effects in collaboration, but no evidence of gender bias in peer review.",other_topic
"TITLE: Attending Church Encourages Acceptance of Atheists? Suppression Effects in Religion and Politics Research
ABSTRACT: A proliferation of religion variables presents opportunities for those studying religion and politics in the U.S. However, many studies in this growing subfield demonstrate the pitfalls of reporting the “independent” effects of variables without qualification. This is especially evident in work on Christian nationalism where researchers often make the claim that worship attendance promotes more pro-social or liberal outcomes, while Christian nationalism promotes more conservative and less pro-social outcomes. We demonstrate that this finding—and others like it—represents a new version of an old problem: a particular structure of relationships between variables that can induce sign switches based on suppression effects (Lenz and Sahn in Political Analysis 29(3):356–369, 2021). While we do not encourage skipping controls, some commonly reported results warrant caution. Researchers should generally avoid unconditional claims about attendance encouraging liberalism. We point a way forward that prioritizes theories of religious communication and encourages the careful examination of relationships via interactions.",other_topic
"TITLE: Electoral participation and satisfaction with democracy in Central and Eastern Europe
ABSTRACT: Does democratic satisfaction drive voter turnout, or does voting increase satisfaction with democracy? This paper explores the satisfaction-participation nexus in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), where democratic dissatisfaction is prominent. It tests preregistered hypotheses using a five-wave panel survey from the Czech 2023 presidential election and a pooled dataset from five CEE countries. Unlike previous studies from Western Europe, it finds evidence for both mechanisms: pre-election satisfaction correlates with participation, but, simultaneously, voters experience a stronger election-related increase in satisfaction than abstainers. Further analyses reveal that the strong increases in satisfaction are driven by election winners and begin already during the election campaign. Our findings highlight the specificities of the satisfaction-participation link and elections’ legitimizing effects in newer democracies.",other_topic
"TITLE: Global Finance, Political Business Cycles, and the Politics of Foreign Reserves
ABSTRACT: Foreign reserves provide developing countries with resources for managing the effects of economic shocks and crises. Why do reserve levels vary across the developing world? Political business cycles (PBCs) have been associated with reserve level decreases, as incumbents draw them down to fund policies that provide voters with material benefits before elections. But governments can also obtain capital by borrowing on bond markets, getting the resources needed to fund PBC policy efforts through alternative means. We hypothesize and find that this means global finance conditions the PBC effect on foreign reserve levels. When pre-election global interest rates are high and borrowing is expensive, governments do draw down reserves. But when pre-election global interest rates are low and borrowing is cheap, governments borrow rather than deplete reserves. This helps explain variation in reserve levels, and thus variation in resilience against economic shocks, across developing countries. The study further suggests the importance of accounting for reserve use in studies of PBC effects on debt, adds novel PBC identification strategies to the literature, and signals how the politics of diverse areas of economic policymaking can be affected by global financial conditions.",other_topic
"TITLE: Absolute and Relative Mobility: Two Frameworks for Connecting Intergenerational Mobility in Absolute and Relative Terms
ABSTRACT: Researchers concerned about intergenerational inequalities study absolute and relative mobility (e.g., whether people’s adult incomes exceed their parents’ incomes in dollars or ranks ). Absolute and relative mobility are connected, by definition. Yet, they are not equivalent. Indeed, they often diverge. To illuminate why, when, and for whom such divergence occurs—and why, when, and for whom convergence is possible—this article provides two frameworks for connecting absolute and relative mobility. One framework is formal and one is typological. Both frameworks center micro-level socioeconomic experiences across generations. Illustrative analyses employ these frameworks using National Longitudinal Survey of Youth data. Results suggest that divergent experiences, like upward absolute mobility despite downward relative mobility, may be more common among more advantaged social groups. Future researchers could use the two frameworks introduced here to further advance our understanding of how intergenerational inequalities evolve differently in absolute and relative terms.",other_topic
"TITLE: Democracies Still in Peril: Reexamining Revenue Mobilization in Liberalizing Developing Economies
ABSTRACT: Do developing-country democracies continue to struggle with revenue loss post-trade liberalization? This article revisits the evidence presented in Democracies in Peril and confirms that, despite critiques suggesting otherwise, a substantial revenue shock persists following tariff reductions, and democracies in less developed countries (LDCs) remain particularly vulnerable. Drawing on updated data from the World Development Indicators and supplemental checks with the International Centre for Tax and Development database, we show that democracies have lagged behind non-democracies in compensating for lost trade tax revenues—even after reforms aimed at expanding income taxes and value-added taxes. In addition to emphasizing ongoing domestic political obstacles in liberalizing democracies, we examine emerging challenges that impede revenue generation in LDCs. We conclude with suggested directions for future research on the politics of revenue generation in LDC democracies, emphasizing how improvements in public goods provision and global tax initiatives could help to end the downward cycle in revenue generation.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Wartime Roots of Rural Governance: Militias’ Evolving Roles in Post-Conflict Peru
ABSTRACT: Under what conditions can militias enhance governance in post-conflict settings? Drawing on nine months of fieldwork in rural Peru, this paper develops a theoretical framework to explain militias’ varied post-civil war trajectories, focusing on their wartime relationships with the military and local communities. I argue that militias with autonomy from the military and strong community ties are more likely to persist and strengthen post-war rural governance. By protecting communities from civil war violence, these militias earn social legitimacy and become institutionalized, prompting their members and local villagers to repurpose them for post-conflict governance roles—an overlooked yet essential trajectory for militias in post-conflict settings. To substantiate my argument, I conduct a comparative historical analysis in Peru’s rural periphery using multiple site-intensive methods, including interviews, archival work, and participant observation. The paper offers insights into the historical legacies of violence, institutional change, and governance in areas with minimal state presence.",other_topic
"TITLE: The effects of social media criticism against public health institutions on trust, emotions, and social media engagement
ABSTRACT: In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization. These results suggest that efforts to bolster institutional trust should pay special attention to criticisms featuring integrity-based trust-undermining narratives.",other_topic

ABSTRACT: We show that increases in the share of workers reporting self-employment to the IRS are not associated with changes in firm-reported payments to “gig” and other contract workers after 2005 but are driven primarily by self-reported earnings of individuals in the EITC phase-in range. We examine a regression discontinuity design that generates exogenous variation in tax rates at the end of the year after labor supply decisions are already sunk and find tax code incentives increase self-employment reporting conditional on actual labor supply. We show that reporting effects have grown over time as knowledge of the tax code spreads. (JEL C83, H24, H31, J22, J23)",other_topic
"TITLE: Exit as Voice: Implications of Russia’s War for the Understanding of Dissent under Authoritarianism
ABSTRACT: Building on the experience of Russian antiwar emigration in 2022, this article reinterprets the categories of “exit” and “voice” to better understand dissent under repressive political regimes. It argues that exit can function as a form of voice in contexts where other forms of voicing discontent are effectively eliminated by repression. This perspective on exit opens the category of voice to a normative conceptualization, defining it as an expression of civic identity. Acting on this identity in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine leads dissenting citizens either into self-imposed exile or inner exile. The article identifies three key modalities of voice available to dissenting citizens: exit-as-voice, voice-after-exit, and oblique voice. In all these modalities, voice is primarily performative, shaped by the political and ethical constraints that emerge from the interplay between repression and resistance. The article draws on an autoethnography of exit within Russian academia and on accounts of resistance both inside and outside Russia.",other_topic
"TITLE: Internal cleavages and changing party system in indigenous politics – The Sámi Parliament of Norway
ABSTRACT: Indigenous politics is different from “normal” politics. It is about power within the state and against the state in which fragmentation is commonly seen as fragility. Political party competition is therefore extremely rare, and interests’ representation is generally not organized through political parties. In this article, we analyze a unique and deviant case – Norway – where Indigenous system-building develops thorough party politics based on internal cleavages. Using unique survey data on Sámi voters ( N = 1134) we show how voters for the Sámi parties are divided on the question of Sámi self-determination and that this has transformed the party system from a “one-party dominant system” towards a two-party system based on an internal cleavage concerning the degree and type of self-determination. This transformation has been made possible by changes in the electoral system, a substantial increase in the Sámi electoral roll and major advancements in Indigenous rights in Norway.",other_topic
"TITLE: Not Playing Favorites: Parents and the Value of Equal Opportunity †
ABSTRACT: We conduct two experiments to identify the value parents place on equality of opportunity when investing in children. The experiments exogenously vary short-run returns to educational investments to identify the weight placed on equalizing “opportunity” (child-level investment) relative to maximizing “returns” (total household earnings) or to equalizing “outcomes” (child-level expected earnings). While parents in both experiments place some weight on maximizing returns, they also display a strong preference for equalizing opportunities and are willing to forgo 15–45 percent of their earnings to do so. Parents in higher-income countries also care about equalizing outcomes, while parents in lower-income countries do not. (JEL D63, J12, J13, O15)",other_topic
"TITLE: Political Opportunity Structure Conditions the Legacy of Political Violence
ABSTRACT: Previous studies render contradictory evidence linking political repression before and political participation after democratization. This article suggests that the perceived political opportunity conditions the long-term effect of political violence: victims punish the authoritarian successor party only if their district is not dominated by it. This hypothesis is examined through the unique context of Taiwan, where the former authoritarian party KMT is still competitive after democratization. Analysis of a newly published White Terror Dataset including 13,206 victims during the martial law period (1949–1987) shows that, if districts have more White Terror victims, KMT received more votes in KMT-dominated districts and fewer votes in districts without KMT domination. The psychological mechanism is supported by a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 910), showing that the White Terror priming increases KMT’s vote when KMT leads in the poll. The result reconciles previous findings and explains authoritarian successor parties’ resilience in new democracies.",other_topic
"TITLE: Female lineages and changing kinship patterns in Neolithic Çatalhöyük
ABSTRACT: Combining 131 paleogenomes with bioarchaeological and archaeological data, we studied social organization and gendered practices in Çatalhöyük East Mound (7100 to 5950 BCE), a major Neolithic settlement in Central Anatolia. In early Çatalhöyük, burials in the same building were frequently close genetic relatives, suggesting that houses were used by biological family members. In later periods, however, individuals buried in the same building were often genetically unrelated, despite sharing similar diets. We found no indication of sex-biased mobility into Çatalhöyük. Meanwhile, in all periods, within-building genetic connections were predominantly maternal rather than paternal. Burials of female subadults also received a higher frequency of gifts than male subadults. Our results reveal how kinship practices changed while specific practices prioritizing female lines persisted for 1000 years at Neolithic Çatalhöyük.",other_topic
"TITLE: We’ll stop having debates: how party organizations strategically invoke evidence
ABSTRACT: As the capacity to analyze data has mushroomed, invoking evidence to justify political opinions has gained popularity. How often do partisan organizations invoke evidence? How has this changed over time? I analyze the national party platforms from the two major American political parties since 1968 to assess when, how, and why the party organizations invoke evidence in their platforms. I introduce two categories for describing usage of evidence in partisan rhetoric: justification —citing evidence to corroborate the logic of existing ideological preferences—and solicitation —advertising interest in having more information to make a future policy decision. Using a novel dataset, I chart the frequency and style of how the two major parties invoke evidence in their platforms. I find stark partisan differences. While both parties primarily use solicitation—a finding that contradicts existing studies of individual political uses of knowledge—Republicans use justification at more than twice the rate of Democrats. I show this pattern accelerating after 1994. I argue that trends in how party organizations reference evidence reflect changes in values, goals, and policy commitments. Far from being neutral indicators of policy effectiveness, evidence is itself the product of and a tool for advancing a party’s agenda.",other_topic
"TITLE: Dynamic Public Perceptions of and Media Influences on Military Threats to Taiwan: A Method Triangulation Approach
ABSTRACT: To understand dynamic public perceptions of the potential military threat posed by China among Taiwanese audiences, the current study considers daily military data, news coverage on major websites, and online forum discussions, along with public opinion surveys. Time-series data for 7 months, integrated into vector autoregression models, support tests of pathways involving (a) changes in factual data to salience in news coverage, (b) changes in news coverage to changes in public perception, (c) changes in public perception to salience in online forum discussions, and (d) reciprocal relationships between changes in news coverage and salience in online forum discussions. Further tests address how the patterns of influence might depend on Taiwan’s polarized political and media landscapes. The results support motivated agenda-setting effects (impact of news salience among willing believers) but reject selective (partisan media shape partisans’ war perceptions) and resonance (issues aligned with the media’s partisan slant shape war perceptions) explanations.",other_topic
"TITLE: Tax havens and income inequality in host countries
ABSTRACT: The association between tax havens and income distribution in home states of multinational corporations has attracted much attention. However, studies have not empirically investigated whether there is also a relationship between low-tax jurisdictions and income inequality in host countries. Our findings, based on data from 152 countries spanning 1972–2020 and a range of econometric strategies, reveal a robust positive relationship between tax haven status and domestic income inequality, with tax havens associated with higher market-income (i.e. pretax and pretransfer) Gini indexes, and estimated postadoption Gini coefficients being larger by an average of 0.54 compared to what would be expected based on global trends, country characteristics, and observable economic factors. We also observe that compensatory tax policies, as well as the type of economic activities attracted by tax havens and their implications for labor markets, seem to mediate this relationship. Our results suggest that low-tax jurisdictions economically harm lower income groups in host countries.",other_topic
"TITLE: Tactics of survival: Strategies of Resistance Data Project update
ABSTRACT: This article presents an update on the Strategies of Resistance Data Project. It extends the original coding of organizations seeking greater self-determination, including demands made by organizations, use of violent and nonviolent tactics and accommodations made to movements with a temporal range of 1960–2020. We elaborate on the update procedures, highlight trends in the data, and provide an application of the data to a number of hypotheses about organizational survival. The article explores tactics and organizational survival in a diverse set of contexts using data on both violent and nonviolent tactics. We find that employing a diversity of large-scale nonviolent tactics is associated with greater organizational survival, while accommodation by the state decreases the chance of survival.",other_topic

ABSTRACT: We estimate the effects of worker voice on productivity, job quality, and separations. We study the 1991 introduction of a right to worker representation on boards or advisory councils in Finnish firms with at least 150 employees, designed to facilitate workforce-management communication. Consistent with information-sharing theories, our difference-in-differences design reveals that worker voice raised labor productivity. In contrast to exit-voice theory, we find no effects on voluntary job separations. However, treated firms reduce involuntary separations (during our recessionary sample period). A 2008 introduction of shop-floor representation, another worker voice institution preexisting in our main firm sample, had more limited effects. (JEL E32, J24, J53, J63, M54)",other_topic
"TITLE: Are catchall strategies bound to fail? The catchall conundrum and the case of a niche agrarian-class party
ABSTRACT: When viewed as a response to long-term decline in a party’s core constituency – whether class, religion or language-based – catchall strategies involve the inherent risk of marginalising the party’s core voter without achieving significant and/or sustained electoral renewal. The risk of core shrinkage will not be offset by a durable electoral dividend and the catchall strategy may well feed the very decline it is designed to arrest. Whilst catchall strategies are not the exclusive preserve of any one type of party, the type of party may well affect the likelihood of achieving a catchall performance. Following Kirchheimer, parties based on a ‘specific professional category’s claims’, such as the Swedish Agrarians, cannot realistically aspire to a ‘successful transformation’. Accordingly, this paper considers whether the pursuit of a catchall strategy by an historic, niche agrarian-class party with exceptional regional strength in neighbouring Finland could hope to achieve a ‘catchall performance’. More widely it considers whether a catchall strategy is a realistic option in multiparty systems in which ‘new politics’ parties squeeze the available policy space and multi-dimensional cleavage structures cannot readily be accommodated within a single party.",other_topic
"TITLE: Legislation Against the Odds: Overcoming Ideological Gridlock in EU Decision‐Making
ABSTRACT: Negotiations in bicameral settings face the risk of gridlock when veto players' preferences diverge on the ideological (left–right) dimension. In the European Union (EU), a high proportion of legislation appears gridlocked yet is nevertheless adopted. We argue that ideological gridlock is resolved through the supply of and trust in legislative concessions. These are made to uphold supranational cooperation, to use issue linkage, and under “permissive consensus” across EU member states. We test our argument using a new dataset on amendments and repeals of existing EU laws (1999–2015). Our results demonstrate that elites' preferences on supranational cooperation as well as the potential for issue linkage help explain legislative success despite gridlock. High public Euroskepticism decreases the likelihood of compromise because lawmakers fear domestic electoral backlash to EU‐level concessions. We contribute to established debates about legislative bargaining under complexity and propose that politicized cooperation can diminish problem‐solving capacity across federations, multi‐level states, and international organizations.",other_topic
"TITLE: The asymmetrical negotiation of legal certainty: neutral places in taxation law in France
ABSTRACT: This article argues that face-to-face professional events where regulators and regulated parties engage in civil and scholarly conversations about the law, such as conferences, seminars, and training sessions, are central to how regulations are interpreted and applied—an understudied aspect of regulatory capture. Critically revisiting Bourdieu and Boltanski’s notion of neutral place, we reconceptualize these events as places where dominant agents of a particular field come together to agree on unifying rules of competition—in the case of tax law that of legal certainty. Using data from semi-structured interviews, as well as statistical analysis and event observations in the field of tax law in France, we show how the structure of these events and the interactions among experts, in a contested move, shift the burden of predictability onto tax regulators, by expecting them to stabilize rule interpretation to leave room for private actors’ strategic uses of the law.",other_topic
"TITLE: AI assessment changes human behavior
ABSTRACT: AI is increasingly replacing human decision-makers across domains. AI-based tools have become particularly common in assessment decisions, such as when recruiting employees or admitting students. Calls for transparency and new legislation require organizations to disclose the use of AI assessment tools, thus making people under assessment aware of its use. We investigate whether this shift from human to AI assessment affects people’s behavior during the assessment. We propose that people emphasize their analytical characteristics and downplay their intuitive and emotional ones under AI (vs. human) assessment, a phenomenon we label “the AI assessment effect.” Twelve studies (eight in text and four in the Supporting Information; N = 13,342) document the AI assessment effect and its underlying mechanism: the lay belief that AI prioritizes analytical characteristics in its assessment. Whereas prior work has studied perceptions of AI assessment tools and their productivity gains, the current research demonstrates systematic behavioral changes because of AI assessment. The findings offer theoretical contributions to the psychology of AI and practical insights for organizations using AI assessment.",other_topic
"TITLE: Multilevel policy textual learning in Chinese local environmental policies
ABSTRACT: While existing research on policy diffusion has provided substantial evidence regarding the drivers of policy adoption across jurisdictions, limited attention has been given to the dynamics of policy textual learning across different levels of government. We fill this gap by using regression analysis to examine the patterns of policy textual learning evident in the clause similarity of seven environmental statutory policies in China. Within China’s decentralized and multilevel environmental governance, our findings reveal that horizontal policy textual learning is more prominent than vertical learning. Temporal distance negatively impacts policy textual learning, whereas spatial distance, contrary to traditional policy diffusion perspectives, does not universally explain multilevel policy textual learning. Additionally, subsequent versions of policy texts are not necessarily similar to earlier ones, challenging conventional assumptions about the adoption and adaptation of policies over time.",other_topic
"TITLE: Of Loving and Losing: The Influence of Dating App Motivations and Perceived Success on Psychological Well-Being
ABSTRACT: We advance communication theory on the relationship between online dating and psychological well-being with a nationally representative, two-wave panel survey of dating app users ( N = 521) that investigates individuals’ motives for dating and their perceived success. Results from an autoregressive structural equation model revealed people felt lonelier when they used dating apps for social approval, but not when they used them to pursue relationships. Perceived success was linked to psychological well-being: people felt lonely and less satisfied when they believed they were not attracting partners and better well-being when they felt successful. Gender differences were observed where women reported being more successful and less lonely but also more anxious about dating than men. However, men were observed to have higher life satisfaction when experiencing higher success. Our findings contribute evidence for the importance of motivations and perceptions in communication technology use and psychological well-being.",other_topic
"TITLE: Generalizing Trimming Bounds for Endogenously Missing Outcome Data Using Random Forests
ABSTRACT: We present a method for narrowing nonparametric bounds on treatment effects by adjusting for potentially large numbers of covariates, using generalized random forests. In many experimental or quasi-experimental studies, outcomes of interest are only observed for subjects who select (or are selected) to engage in the activity generating the outcome. Outcome data are thus endogenously missing for units who do not engage, and random or conditionally random treatment assignment before such choices is insufficient to identify treatment effects. Nonparametric partial identification bounds address endogenous missingness without having to make disputable parametric assumptions. Basic bounding approaches often yield bounds that are wide and minimally informative. Our approach can tighten such bounds while permitting agnosticism about the data-generating process and honest inference. A simulation study and replication exercise demonstrate the benefits.",other_topic

In this we follow Eve Sedgwick’s orientation away from a “minoritizing” to a “universalizing” epistemological perspective that situates this responsibility relative to resisting democratic decline.",other_topic
"TITLE: Identity construction through talk of difference and similarity: blocking and threading analysis
ABSTRACT: Identity construction is a continuous process that permeates all social life. Drawing from intercultural communication scholarship and the Bakhtinian perspective on the construction of the self, we suggest that identity is constructed in talk through the interplay of socially constructed, ideologically imbued similarities and differences and propose the blocking and threading analysis (BTA) method to study this process. Blocking refers to constructing differences and social boundaries, whereas threading creates similarities, unity, and commonality. These practices are intertwined, and we argue that identity emerges from the constant shifts between the two. The four-step analytical process entails identifying positioning, recognizing connected utterances, interpreting blocking and threading, and examining their shifts. We illustrate the analytical force of BTA by an analysis of an extract from a focus group discussion among an interprofessional healthcare team. The method requires further application to different datasets, but it shows promise in terms of bringing new insights into research on identity construction.",other_topic
"TITLE: Hi Mama! Daycare apps and the mediatization of parenting and care work
ABSTRACT: Daycare management apps – marketed to care centers as a way to streamline operations and improve parent-caregiver communication – have quickly moved from relative obscurity in 2016 to near-omnipresence in center-based childcare. These apps mediate the work of caregiving and are thus a growing aspect of the nexus of cultural anxieties about how to manage reproductive labor, parenting, and gendered expectations of mothering. In this paper, we engage in a close reading of five major daycare apps in the US – Brightwheel, Lillio (formerly HiMama), My Bright Day, Procare, and Tadpoles – to investigate how they structure the experience and labor practices of both parenting and non-parent caregiving. As such, we read the app interfaces as material practices through which parents and caregivers grapple with the contradictions of the care crisis and contemporary conditions of parenting. Throughout this article, we attend to the ways that the technological imaginary unfolds in a specific site within the broader context of caregiving in the United States, ultimately arguing that these apps reflect and reaffirm caregiving practices that align with practices of so-called intensive or transcendent parenting.",other_topic
"TITLE: Early insight into social network structure predicts climbing the social ladder
ABSTRACT: While occupying an influential position within one’s social network brings many advantages, it is unknown how certain individuals rise in social prominence. Leveraging a longitudinal dataset that tracks an entirely new network of college freshmen ( N  = 187), we test whether “climbing the social ladder” depends on knowing how other people are connected to each other. Those who ultimately come to occupy the most influential positions exhibit early and accurate representations of their network’s general, abstract structure (i.e., who belongs to which communities and cliques). In contrast, detailed, granular representations of specific friendships do not translate into gains in social influence over time. Only once the network stabilizes do the most influential individuals exhibit the most accurate representations of specific friendships. These findings reveal that those who climb the social ladder first detect their emerging network’s general structure and then fine-tune their knowledge about individual relationships between their peers as network dynamics settle.",other_topic
"TITLE: War and Responsibility
ABSTRACT: Scholars and policymakers bemoan an imperial presidency in the war powers context, where the unilateral use of force is frequently interpreted as evidence of an unconstrained executive. Focusing on the strong blame avoidance incentives faced by politicians in the military intervention setting, I develop a model of the war powers focused on “Loss Responsibility Costs.” It suggests that presidents only risk full-scale war when they have the political cover provided by formal authorization, which forces lawmakers to share responsibility. Smaller interventions, in contrast, are frequently undertaken unilaterally because having the president act alone is consistent with congressional preferences for blame avoidance. Novel sentiment data based on tens of thousands of congressional speeches supports the claim that when the president acts unilaterally, they almost always act alongside lawmaker support, who favor intervention but avoid formally endorsing the endeavor. Altogether, it suggests legislators’ influence over war is stronger than commonly appreciated.",other_topic
"TITLE: Preferences, Selection, and the Structure of Teacher Pay
ABSTRACT: I examine teacher preferences using a discrete-choice experiment linked to data on teacher effectiveness. I estimate willingness to pay for a rich set of compensation elements and working conditions. Highly effective teachers usually have the same preferences as their peers, but they have stronger preferences for performance pay. I use the preference estimates to investigate the optimal compensation structure for three key objectives: maximizing teacher utility, maximizing teacher retention, and maximizing student achievement. Under each objective, schools underutilize salary and performance pay while overutilizing retirement benefits. Restructuring compensation can significantly improve both teacher welfare and student achievement. (JEL H75, I21, J31, J32, J45, J81)",other_topic
"TITLE: Beyond Formal Power: How Central Roles in Political Networks are Related to Media Visibility
ABSTRACT: A recurring finding in communication studies is that political actors with formal-institutional power are highly visible in the media. The relationship between informal power and media visibility remains less understood. This study examines whether central roles in networks of political collaboration—as indicators of informal power—are associated with increased visibility in mainstream news media. We hypothesize that organizations with central roles are more visible in the media because informal power increases their newsworthiness. Using social network methods and Bayesian regressions on survey and media data on organizations involved in climate policy in Finland, we find that central organizations with many collaboration partners receive more media coverage. Other central roles, such as brokerage or coalition leadership, are not associated with media visibility. This study advances knowledge of media visibility by showing that informal power is associated with media visibility, and that some power positions are more important than others.",other_topic
"TITLE: Twisted tongue: limits of China’s propaganda during crises and policy changes
ABSTRACT: Extensive research showcases that authoritarian propaganda can cultivate support and deter protest during “normal” times. This study examines authoritarian propaganda’s efficacy during crises and policy changes when the regime needs it most. We posit that various propaganda strategies, including “hard” and “soft” rhetoric, have significant limitations during crises. Hard propaganda’s heavy-handed slogans could signal regime strength but may also legitimize “rightful resistance” against local authorities, limiting its protest-deterrence effects. Soft propaganda may lose persuasiveness due to presenting contradictory arguments during policy changes. We leverage the turbulent period of China’s COVID policy reversal to conduct an original survey experiment in December 2022. Our findings reveal that pro-reopening hard propaganda weakens its protest-deterrence effects by reinforcing belief in protest righteousness. Moreover, inconsistent soft propaganda lowers public evaluations of China’s COVID response, diminishing its persuasive effects. Our study highlights significant limitations of authoritarian propaganda during crises and policy changes.",other_topic
"TITLE: A norm about harvest division is maintained by a desire to follow tradition, not by social policing
ABSTRACT: Determining how people behave in contexts governed by social norms can clarify both how norms influence human behavior and how norms evolve. We examined cooperative farming harvest division among the Derung, a Tibeto-Burman-speaking horticultural society in southwestern China. In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution. They also accurately guessed that others shared this preference and would approve of such divisions. Nonetheless, they still followed the prevailing norm of dividing by household. Their self-reported explanation for this behavior was that they desired to follow their traditional practices. Such a normative decision-making algorithm can allow individually consequential norms to persist without costly policing by other group members.",other_topic
"TITLE: Large language models show amplified cognitive biases in moral decision-making
ABSTRACT: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely used, people increasingly rely on them to make or advise on moral decisions. Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is, therefore, important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated these questions by asking a range of LLMs to emulate or advise on people’s decisions in realistic moral dilemmas. In Study 1, we compared LLM responses to those of a representative U.S. sample ( N = 285) for 22 dilemmas, including both collective action problems that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost–benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In collective action problems, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: They usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 ( N = 474, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and documented an additional bias: Unlike humans, most LLMs were biased toward answering “no” in moral dilemmas, thus flipping their decision/advice depending on how the question is worded. In Study 3 ( N = 491, preregistered), we replicated these biases in LLMs using everyday moral dilemmas adapted from forum posts on Reddit. In Study 4, we investigated the sources of these biases by comparing models with and without fine-tuning, showing that they likely arise from fine-tuning models for chatbot applications. Our findings suggest that uncritical reliance on LLMs’ moral decisions and advice could amplify human biases and introduce potentially problematic biases.",other_topic
"TITLE: Managers, Professionals, or Public Servants? Organizational Professionals in the Public Sector as Hybrid Professionals
ABSTRACT: The expansion of organizational professionals in the public sector is often interpreted as a manifestation of increased managerial control and bureaucratisation, raising questions about shifting professional identities in public administration. This study contributes to research on hybrid professionalism and identity work by examining how organizational professionals themselves perceive this trend and how they justify their roles within public organizations. Based on a narrative analysis of interviews with 24 organizational professionals in Sweden, we examine how they construct their professional identity in relation to competing institutional logics. We expand the concept of hybrid professionalism by incorporating a public service logic alongside managerial and professional logics. We find that respondents frame their identity around the notion of performing a support function for frontline services. This positioning enables them to rearticulate managerial activities as supportive rather than controlling, thereby presenting their work as a response to bureaucratisation rather than a source of it.",other_topic

We use plausibly exogenous variation created by the NFSA to estimate the effect of food transfers on child nutrition. Using individual panel data across eight states in India over five years, we find that increased transfers significantly reduced stunting. The food transfers increased wage incomes and improved dietary diversity. Our results suggest that, in the states we study, the NFSA prevented approximately 1.8 million children from being stunted (JEL I12, I18, I38, J13, O12)",other_topic
"TITLE: Asymmetric autonomy: pension fund investing between members and markets
ABSTRACT: Pension funds occupy a special position in the financial system: their long-term investment orientation and social outlook have led to calls for pension investment for purposes beyond the provision of retirement income. Scholars of financialization have questioned the possibilities to mobilize pension assets for other (e.g. social or environmental) goals by pointing to the constraining power of financial intermediaries. This article explores potential constraints on pension fund investments through an empirical case study of pension funds in the Netherlands. We show that pension funds’ position between members and financial intermediaries restricts their capacity to act as autonomous investors, albeit in asymmetric ways. Although pension fund boards are required to consider member preferences, knowledge deficits and organizational distance enable them to carve out discretionary space. However, due to regulatory requirements, their autonomy vis-à-vis financial intermediaries is more limited. We illustrate our findings with regards to pension funds’ adoption of sustainable investment.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Values of Fame: Exploring the Visual and Textual Representations of Basic Values in Influencers’ Instagram Content
ABSTRACT: Despite the popularity of social media influencers (SMIs), little is known about how their content reflects and conveys certain values, leaving a gap in understanding their role as value intermediaries. This content analysis examined the representation of Schwartz values in the Instagram profiles of 59 of the most followed Western SMIs, celebrities, and athletes. Relying on 1256 posts and 2936 stories, the study documented the prevalence of values, modalities of representations (multimodal complexity and post-caption congruence), and differences between SMIs, athletes, and celebrities. Results revealed that 60.3% of the content portrayed at least one value, with achievement, benevolence, and hedonism being the most frequent. Multilevel analyses indicated that SMIs and athletes were more likely to post hedonism and benevolence, while celebrities were more likely to share universalism than SMIs. Most values were represented through low to medium levels of multimodal complexity, and only 15.3% showed post-caption congruence. These findings underscore the need to document how global digital platforms and actors mediate value representation, as they have the potential to shape audience values and cultural norms.",other_topic
"TITLE: Who Needs a Theory of Justice? Judith Shklar and the Politics of Injustice
ABSTRACT: Much recent political theory aims to move beyond the dominant approach to theorizing justice by foregrounding cases of injustice. Judith Shklar’s The Faces of Injustice is regularly invoked in this context, yet the full force of her challenge to the “normal model of justice” and its implications for understanding injustice have not been fully appreciated. This article reconstructs and defends Shklar’s approach to theorizing injustice. It evaluates the differences between John Rawls’s account of the sense of justice and Shklar’s notion of the sense of injustice, showing why the latter should be theorized in relation to plural, competing, and ever-changing expectations, rather than in relation to ideal principles of justice. It illustrates how we can evaluate political responses to injustice without recourse to such principles and maintains that doing so is a strength of any democratic theory that is committed to giving injustice its due.",other_topic
"TITLE: A Revolution in Revolutionary Theory?
ABSTRACT: Recently, the field of revolutionary theory has seen a flourishing of novel scholarly efforts that constitute a genuine regeneration of how we conceive of, investigate, and interpret revolutions. The first elements of this regeneration of revolutionary theory have now found their way to print, and the scene is set for a prospective revolution in our field. This article surveys the history of revolutionary theory since 1883, establishes the scope and contribution of the field’s present rejuvenation, and charts the place of these developments in the field’s broader path, before closing by exploring what may be in store for students of revolution in the future. In doing so, the article draws attention to three areas of current rejuvenation: latent patterns of revolution; long revolutionary outcomes; and revolutionary ideas. Moreover, it proposes three areas for fruitful new research: revolutionary programs, revolutions as political systems, and the dynamics occurring within “the fog of revolution.”",other_topic
"TITLE: From Codebooks to Promptbooks: Extracting Information from Text with Generative Large Language Models
ABSTRACT: Generative AI (GenAI) is quickly becoming a valuable tool for sociological research. Already, sociologists employ GenAI for tasks like classifying text and simulating human agents. We point to another major use case: the extraction of structured information from unstructured text. Information Extraction (IE) is an established branch of Natural Language Processing, but leveraging the affordances of this paradigm has thus far required familiarity with specialized models. GenAI changes this by allowing researchers to define their own IE tasks and execute them via targeted prompts. This article explores the potential of open-source large language models for IE by extracting and encoding biographical information (e.g., age, occupation, origin) from a corpus of newspaper obituaries. As we proceed, we discuss how sociologists can develop and evaluate prompt architectures for such tasks, turning codebooks into “promptbooks.” We also evaluate models of different sizes and prompting techniques. Our analysis showcases the potential of GenAI as a flexible and accessible tool for IE while also underscoring risks like non-random error patterns that can bias downstream analyses.",other_topic
"TITLE: Institutions of public judgment established by social contract and taxation
ABSTRACT: Indirect reciprocity is a compelling explanation for stable cooperation in a large society: Those who cooperate appropriately earn a good standing, so that others are more likely to cooperate with them. However, this mechanism requires a population to agree on who has good standing and who has bad standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here, we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution for judging reputations: a tax collected from each member of the population. We analyze the possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how strong the incentives against corruption need to be. Our analysis has implications for establishing robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations—and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.",other_topic

ABSTRACT: Following Hungary’s 2010 parliamentary election, the Fidesz–KDNP government, as part of a comprehensive restructuring of the country’s constitutional system, fundamentally modified the electoral system approved in 1989, maintaining the mixed system but introducing a number of significant changes to it. The paper seeks to provide a comparative analysis of the 1989 and 2011 electoral systems, with particular focus on how the ruling parties have adapted the new system to their own advantage. Our study aims to shed light on how an electoral system can be susceptible to manipulation through the application of political reasoning that may appear neutral and “well-intentioned”.

ABSTRACT: Ideas of “craft” and “craftsmanship” have long been mobilized in middle-class Global North markets to promote the romanticized authenticity of artisanal goods, but what happens when these ideas are applied to industrially-made products? This article analyzes the artisanal imaginaries of the Australian Made Campaign to explore how the campaign taps into the growing cultural desirability of the handmade and the artisanal, and heightened concerns about the future sustainability of mass production. Focusing on the discursive and aesthetic approach of the campaign’s Facebook posts, we show how the campaign contributes to a wider mainstreaming of neo-craft as a dominant mode for promoting production in a national context where onshore manufacturing has long been in decline. We argue that the campaign’s media repertoires work to “domesticate” large-scale manufacturing via emotive appeals to traditional artisanal tropes (“love,” “family,” “care”) to tap into the zeitgeist appeal of locally-specific and knowable scales of production.",other_topic
"TITLE: Hype, financial narratives, and self-fulfilling prophecies in surveillance capitalism
ABSTRACT: The rise of platforms has transformed our understanding of contemporary capitalism, with the critical literature describing how these firms leverage unprecedented digital powers to extract monopoly rents – perhaps even heralding a new form of Feudalism. This paper draws on the literature on financial narratives to examine the role that such stories play within the form of capitalism that they describe, and what this suggests for the role of “hype” in contemporary capitalism. The same stories that for critical scholars appear as menacing threats of “technofeudalism” or “surveillance capitalism” for investors appear as optimistic stories of promising future returns. By driving financial investments, narratives afford platforms very real social and political powers, enabling them to function as a form of self-fulfilling prophecies. The paper argues for a cultural inflection to the political economy of Big Tech – viewing capitalism as neither mechanistic nor rational, but as an expression of a complex interplay between narrative, technology, and economic power. This suggests the need for a critical hype studies , geared at deconstructing the narratives undergirding the technological waves of capitalist pursuits, and examining the broader role of hype in coordinating and directing flows of capital within contemporary financialized capitalism.",other_topic
"TITLE: How United Nations peace operations can help overcome perils to post-conflict elections
ABSTRACT: Agreeing to elections is generally seen as a key way to settle armed conflict and prevent recurrent violence. However, the transition from violent conflict to nonviolent electoral competition can be fraught with many challenges. Stable electoral competition requires trust in institutions, but trust often takes a long time to develop and is often lacking in post-conflict elections. We argue that UN peacebuilding operations can play an indispensable role in the development of stable electoral institutions through three interrelated ways: reducing political and electoral violence, supporting democratic attitudes and norms of peaceful coexistence, and reinforcing institutional capacity and the rule of law. Using a new measure of the expected quality of elections in post-conflict countries between 1946 and 2012, we show that UN peace missions are associated with better elections and a greater likelihood of successful transitions to electoral competition compared to post-conflict countries without UN involvement. We also find larger differences when the UN is involved in establishing electoral institutions, especially when there is no or limited prior electoral competition, indicating that the UN is effective at assisting the democratization processes in difficult contexts.",other_topic
"TITLE: Detecting pro-kremlin disinformation using large language models
ABSTRACT: A growing body of literature examines manipulative information by detecting political mis-/disinformation in text data. This line of research typically involves highly costly manual annotation of text for manual content analysis, and/or training and validating automated downstream approaches. We examine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can detect pro-Kremlin disinformation about the war in Ukraine, focusing on the case of the downing of the civilian flight MH17. We benchmark methods using a large set of tweets labeled by expert annotators. We show that both open and closed LLMs can accurately detect pro-Kremlin disinformation tweets, outperforming both a research assistant and supervised models used in earlier research and at drastically lower cost compared to either research assistants or crowd workers. Our findings contribute to the literature on mis/-disinformation by showcasing how LLMs can substantially lower the costs of detection even when the labeling requires complex, context-specific knowledge about a given case.",other_topic
"TITLE: PAPEA: A modular pipeline for the automation of protest event analysis
ABSTRACT: Protest event analysis (PEA) is the core method to understand spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of protest. We show how Large Language Models (LLM) can be used to automate the classification of protest events and of political event data more broadly with levels of accuracy comparable to humans, while reducing necessary annotation time by several orders of magnitude. We propose a modular pipeline for the automation of PEA (PAPEA) based on fine-tuned LLMs and provide publicly available models and tools which can be easily adapted and extended. PAPEA enables getting from newspaper articles to PEA datasets with high levels of precision without human intervention. A use case based on a large German news-corpus illustrates the potential of PAPEA.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Social Construction of Mental Health Facts in Social Media Language
ABSTRACT: Social media has had a significant impact on the increasing visibility of mental health. This article draws on a digital ethnographic approach and discourse analysis of posts to the microblogging site X (formerly Twitter) to examine uses of and metacommunication about the language of mental health. The analysis traces and snapshots how mental health language is being used to construct mental health, mental illness, and related subjects as a meaningful social object by participants on social media. The results focus on a particular practice around contesting the language and meaning of mental health designations, identities and language as a form of communication ritual that produces normative metadiscourse about mental health, what it means, and how we should understand and talk about it.",other_topic
"TITLE: Generative AI without guardrails can harm learning: Evidence from high school mathematics
ABSTRACT: Generative AI is poised to revolutionize how humans work, and has already demonstrated promise in significantly improving human productivity. A key question is how generative AI affects learning—namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (“GPT Base”) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (“GPT Tutor”). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)—i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor. Without guardrails, students attempt to use GPT-4 as a “crutch” during practice problem sessions, and subsequently perform worse on their own. Thus, decision-makers must be cautious about design choices underlying generative AI deployments to preserve skill learning and long-term productivity.",other_topic
"TITLE: Volatility-driven learning in human infants
ABSTRACT: Adapting to change is a fundamental feature of human learning, yet its developmental origins remain elusive. We developed an experimental and computational approach to track infants’ adaptive learning processes via pupil size, an indicator of tonic and phasic noradrenergic activity. We found that 8-month-old infants’ tonic pupil size mirrored trial-by-trial fluctuations in environmental volatility, while phasic pupil responses revealed that infants used this information to dynamically optimize their learning. This adaptive strategy resulted in successful task performance, as evidenced by anticipatory looking toward correct target locations. The ability to estimate volatility varied significantly across infants, and these individual differences were related to infant temperament, indicating early links between cognitive adaptation and emotional responsivity. These findings demonstrate that infants actively adapt to environmental change, and that early differences in this capacity may have profound implications for long-term cognitive and psychosocial development.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Nesting Strategies of E-Commerce Wanghong: Promotional Temporalities in Online Shopping Festivals on Chinese Platforms
ABSTRACT: The wanghong economy in China adopts unique platform monetization strategies, including social tipping, virtual gifting, advertising, and more prominently, e-commerce. E-commerce wanghong are one type of influencer focusing on pushing sales through e-commerce services and play a pivotal role in integrating e-commerce and social media. Online shopping festivals have recently catalyzed the intersection of wanghong cultures and e-commerce. A typical example is the e-commerce giant Alibaba, which implemented multi-stage promotional activities during online shopping festivals to provide practitioners with expanded business opportunities. Notably, this flourishing integration of e-commerce and wanghong culture is carefully guided by the Chinese government’s unique political agenda and regulatory framework. To study this dynamic interplay between e-commerce wanghong, platforms, and national policies, we explore how e-commerce wanghong become a kind of “platformed wanghong.” Furthermore, we examine how e-commerce platforms change users’ experiences of time during online shopping festivals, which we refer to as “promotional temporalities.” Finally, we investigate the “nesting strategies” employed by e-commerce wanghong during these events, which are intertwined with the platform’s promotional temporalities and must navigate compliance within the national regulatory framework. Our findings shed light on the complex relationship between e-commerce wanghong, platform strategies, state regulation, and audience engagement in the context of platform economy.",other_topic
"TITLE: Pseudo Lindahl Equilibrium as a Collective Choice Rule
ABSTRACT: A collective choice problem specifies a finite set of alternatives from which a group of expected utility maximizers must choose. We associate a collective pseudo market with every collective choice problem and establish the existence and efficiency of pseudo Lindahl equilibrium (PLE) allocations. We also associate a cooperative bargaining problem with every collective choice problem and define a set-valued solution concept, the ω-weighted Nash bargaining set where ω is a vector of welfare weights. We provide axioms that characterize the ω-weighted Nash bargaining set. Our main result shows that ω-weighted Nash bargaining set payoffs are also the PLE payoffs of the corresponding collective pseudo market with the same utility functions and incomes ω. We define a pseudo core for collective pseudo markets and show that pseudo Lindahl equilibria are in the pseudo core. We characterize the set of PLE outcomes of discrete allocation problems and show that they contain the set of pseudo Walrasian equilibrium outcomes.",other_topic
"TITLE: The logic of secret alliances
ABSTRACT: Alliances are typically understood as agreements intended to deter aggression from enemy states. By signaling an ally's commitment to a protégé state, a shared enemy may be deterred from attacking. In light of this signaling logic, secret alliances are puzzling. Because they are not observed, secret alliances by definition cannot achieve deterrence through signaling. So why do states enter into these secret agreements? We argue that alliances may also act as a signal of a state's intentions, potentially undermining deterrence. If a new alliance signals that the members' interests are unaligned with those of a shared enemy, the enemy may be provoked into war. As a consequence, states sometimes want to keep alliance agreements secret. To develop this argument, we analyze a formal model in which states may enter into secret or public alliance agreements. We find that the possibility of secret alliances has general effects on deterrence—possibly undermining the deterrent value of concurrent public alliances.",other_topic
"TITLE: The evolution of infant-directed communication: Comparing vocal input across all great apes
ABSTRACT: Human language is unique among communication systems since many elements are learned and transmitted across generations. Previous research suggests that this process is best predicted by infant-directed communication, i.e., a mode of communication directed by caregivers to children. Despite its importance for language, whether infant-directed communication is unique to humans or rooted more deeply in the primate lineage remains unclear. To assess this, we investigated directed and surrounding vocal communication in human infants and infants of wild nonhuman great apes. Our findings reveal that human infants receive dramatically more infant-directed communication than nonhuman great ape infants. These data suggest that the earliest hominins likely relied more on surrounding communication to become communicatively competent, while infant-directed vocal communication became considerably more prominent with human language.",other_topic
"TITLE: Making Decisions under Model Misspecification
ABSTRACT: We use decision theory to confront uncertainty that is sufficiently broad to incorporate “models as approximations.” We presume the existence of a featured collection of what we call “structured models” that have explicit substantive motivations. The decision maker confronts uncertainty through the lens of these models, but also views these models as simplifications, and hence, as misspecified. We extend the max-min analysis under model ambiguity to incorporate the uncertainty induced by acknowledging that the models used in decision-making are simplified approximations. Formally, we provide an axiomatic rationale for a decision criterion that incorporates model misspecification concerns. We then extend our analysis beyond the max-min case allowing for a more general criterion that encompasses a Bayesian formulation.",other_topic
"TITLE: Earliest evidence of rice cultivation in Remote Oceania: Ritual use by the first islanders in the Marianas 3500 years ago
ABSTRACT: Rice was a staple crop in the ancestral Austronesian regions of Taiwan and Island Southeast Asia, but it was unknown in any of the Pacific Islands at the time of European encounters, with the exception of the unique case of Guam and the Mariana Islands. Through multiple methodologies, including phytolith analysis, micro–computed tomography scanning, and thin-section petrography, this recent research confirms the presence of abundant rice husk and leaf phytoliths adhering to red-slipped pottery (“Marianas Red”) at the Ritidian Site Complex in Guam, dated by radiocarbon to 3500 to 3100 years ago. This study addresses the long-standing question of whether the first Pacific Islanders transported rice with them from the Philippines across 2300 kilometers of open sea, representing the longest known ocean voyage of the time. During this early period, rice was restricted to special ritual events in the Marianas. The early voyage apparently was planned with provisions of rice at 3500 years ago.",other_topic
"TITLE: Integration for whom? The migration bias in social norms
ABSTRACT: Integration has become a dominant framework in the governance of immigration, indicating what states and “host societies” expect immigrants to do and how to behave to become accepted members of the receiving country. Critical scholarship has argued that this creates an unequal normative burden: “immigrants” are subject to integration demands while “native citizens” are exempt. Despite this widely acknowledged “integration dispensation”, the asymmetry of expectations has not been empirically tested. In this article, we conceptualize immigrant integration in terms of social norms – expectations regarding the social, economic, cultural, and political participation – and develop a theory of a migration bias: the idea that these norms are stronger for immigrants than for society at large. We test this hypothesis using a population-based survey experiment in Switzerland. Our results provide evidence for a migration bias, particularly in the social dimension of integration and expectations concerning respect for laws and constitutional values. However, this bias is context-dependent, appearing in the German-speaking part of Switzerland but not in the French-speaking counterpart. These findings provide novel insights into the popular understanding of immigrant integration and the nature of social norms and citizenship in diverse societies.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: Triangulating the Relationship Between Education and Attitudes Toward Immigration
ABSTRACT: Education is widely believed to predict attitudes toward immigration, but what causal relationship underlies this descriptive pattern? This research employs three distinct natural experiments and considers genetic factors to triangulate this relationship: Study 1 analyses discordant monozygotic twins; Study 2 assesses the impact of a Swedish education reform; and Study 3 analyses dizygotic twins with the use of a polygenic index for education, a DNA-based measure for genetic predispositions toward education. The results indicate that education does modestly promote open views toward immigration (Study 1), yet the reform’s effect remains uncertain (Study 2). Study 3 offers direct evidence of the effects of genetic predispositions and suggests that genetics related to education may influence attitudes beyond achieved educational attainment. These findings confirm the positive impact of education while pointing to the combined influence of genetic and social pathways in shaping immigration attitudes.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: People‐Processing Capacity: The Origins and Development of Institutions to Render Forced Migrants as Cases in Canada and Sweden
ABSTRACT: States have invested heavily in controlling forced migration for decades, with mixed results. Research often focuses on deterrence, leading to a neglect of bureaucratic boundaries within borders. This article unpacks the unrecognized importance of people‐processing capacity: a state's ability to render forced migrants legible by categorizing them as cases and selecting those perceived as desirable victims. Due to the heterogeneous nature of claims and the agency of migrants, rendering migrants as cases is a deeply complicated process. Using a historical‐institutionalist framework, the article explores the role and historical development of people‐processing capacity through a comparison of the evolution of modern migration control in Canada and Sweden, two states with similar trajectories of capacity‐building but different guiding ideas for migration policy. The results trace the institutional roots of deservingness, reveal different ideals of vulnerable and adaptable refugees, and theorize how persistent governance problems emerge from classification systems intended to order migration.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: The grass is always greener on the other side: Transnational ethnic inequality and ethno-nationalist conflict
ABSTRACT: Existing research has shown that horizontal inequalities arising from comparisons between ethnic groups can promote ethno-nationalist conflict. However, these studies have largely focused on comparison between groups within the same country. In this article, we extend this perspective and study comparisons with kin groups abroad and how they affect the risk of ethnic civil war. In particular, we address the fact that many groups have several kin groups abroad, all of which could serve as reference points for comparison. Drawing on insights from social psychology, we argue that the comparisons made with different groups involve distinct motivations, which can yield varying degrees of stimulus related to the outbreak of ethno-nationalist conflict. Our results suggest that comparisons with kin groups abroad – especially the best (most well-off) groups, as well as the nearest or median groups – are salient in increasing the propensity for conflict incidence. Moreover, groups that are relatively well-off and thus prone to downward comparisons, especially when the group is wealthier than all of its transnational kin groups, are much less likely to fight. A novel finding emerges: relative poverty in comparison with transnational kin does not appear to exacerbate the potential for conflict, but relative wealth does appear to attenuate it.",other_topic
"TITLE: How do employers shape trade union revitalization strategies towards migrant workers? Evidence from the German shipbuilding industry
ABSTRACT: Trade unions and works councils in the German shipbuilding industry were among those pioneering more inclusive strategies for migrant workers. However, these efforts remained limited and partially failed. Based on a qualitative industry study, our findings shed light on the dynamics and reasons behind this path of 'limited solidarity' in a union stronghold. While much of the literature on (barriers to) more solidaristic employment relations has focused on union identities and activities, our article seeks to highlight how production systems and employer strategies shape union revitalisation strategies and influence their success or failure. To sustain the transnationalised, export-oriented production model, shipyards rely on an increasingly professionalised ecosystem of subcontracting firms that help them recruit, train, and flexibly deploy pools of cheaper peripheral labour. While some of the literature points to regulatory policies that facilitate employers' regime-shopping strategies, our findings show that today, paradoxically, it is precisely the context of increased re-regulation of European cross-border labour markets that leads firms to develop more opaque contractual relations, creating additional obstacles and sobering experiences for organised labour. Substantial improvements are not to be expected from more power for workers alone but also require fundamental reforms.",immigration_topic
"TITLE: Reassessing the Impact of Local Control: When Smaller Local Governments Permit More Housing
ABSTRACT: Housing scarcity is a widespread social and economic problem. Prior studies have attributed this scarcity to local control over land use, which has been seen as making policy makers more responsive to small electorates. Challenging this argument, we suggest that smaller jurisdictions have stronger incentives and greater capacity to raise tax revenue by building housing. Therefore, expanding the electorate that policy makers are responsive to could lead to a more restrictive housing policy. To explore this question empirically, we study a reform that consolidated some Danish municipalities, increasing the size of their jurisdiction. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that consolidated municipalities issue fewer permits and complete less housing than smaller jurisdictions. Our study thus shows that politicians permitted more housing when they were accountable to a smaller electorate. This upends conventional wisdom and suggests that local control need not be at odds with more liberal land use policy.",other_topic
"TITLE: Not of Primary Concern: Assessing Ideological Voting Over Time in U.S. Primaries, 2008–2024
ABSTRACT: America’s major political parties have been riven by ideological factions which contest for power partly through partisan primaries. Ideological factions can only be grounded in voting behavior to the extent that primary voters are consistently ideological across primaries. Yet, prior research has relied overwhelmingly on cross-sectional analyses. This paper thus provides new, over-time evidence on the extent of ideological voting in partisan presidential and Senate primaries. It first uses population-based panel data which measures the same respondents’ presidential primary preferences in 2008, 2016, and 2020 to investigate ideology’s role in stabilizing primary vote choices. Across pairs of primaries, over one third of respondents prefer candidates representing different ideological factions within the same party. To extend these analyses to Senate races and address concerns about sampling biases, it also draws on precinct-level returns in five states’ primaries (2008–2024). Evidence from these varied sources points to one conclusion: ideological considerations influence primary voting, but their modest association with vote choice and limited over-time stability leaves substantial room for other factors.",other_topic
"TITLE: Ladies’ Choice: Intersectional Linked Fate and Public Opinion Toward Women of Color in Politics
ABSTRACT: This article seeks to understand the public opinion formation among women of color in America. How do identity-based factors, such as linked fate with women of color (WoC), shape political evaluations? Expanding on social identity theory and intersectionality frameworks, we investigate the political influences of WoC identification and WoC intersectional linked fate. We argue that intersectional linked fate represents a deeper sense of shared experiences and interconnected outcomes across race and gender, making this both a conceptually distinct construct and a politically consequential extension of WoC identity. Further, we theorize that women of color’s perceptions of intersectional linked fate drive their cross-racial support for real-world WoC in politics. We analyze data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey to test how intersectional linked fate correlates with evaluations of prominent WoC political figures such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, and Michelle Obama among Black, Latina, and Asian American women. Our findings reveal that intersectional linked fate has a stronger and more consistent influence on these political evaluations than either WoC identity or racial linked fate, fostering solidarity and support for WoC politicians across racial boundaries. The results highlight the critical role of intersectional linked fate in shaping public opinion with important implications for understanding future elections, especially as candidates, politics, and the electorate continue to diversify in the United States.",other_topic
"TITLE: Is there a growing gender divide among young adults in regard to ideological left–right self-placement? Evidence from 32 European countries
ABSTRACT: Growing gender differences in political ideology among young people are a major concern because of their potential long-term societal implications. This study examines ideological shifts between young men and women in 32 European countries from 1990 to 2023, and how they are linked to societal levels of gender equality. Using data from several Eurobarometer surveys, we analyse the left–right self-placement of over 466,089 individuals aged 20–29. Using graphical analyses, regression models and age-period-cohort (APC) analyses, we find heterogeneity in the extent and development of ideological youth gender gaps. In 14 countries, the ideological positions of women and men are almost equal. In seven countries there is a modern youth gender gap in political ideology, with women being more left-wing than men. This has remained roughly stable since the 1990s. In 11 countries, a modern youth gender gap has emerged and/or widened over time. Finally, we find that modern youth gender gaps tend to be greater in countries with greater gender equality. The mainly small to moderate gender gaps—with important differences between countries—contradict the narrative of a strong and uniform shift towards a modern gender gap in political ideology among young adults.",other_topic
"TITLE: Race, Racism, and the Crisis of Democracy in Political Science
ABSTRACT: Over the past decade, autocratization has increased worldwide, and the United States itself has seen its own democracy erode. While political scientists have begun to study both phenomena in earnest, with exceptions, they have been unable to fully wrestle with either. We suggest that this incomplete understanding is the result of the discipline's problematic racial history. At the time of its founding in the late nineteenth century, political science provided a eugenicist justification for the very hierarchies and segregations that are now under scrutiny. Race was understood to be the quintessential subject of social scientific inquiry. After World War II, political scientists rejected eugenics and instead focused on defending democracy against totalitarianism. In doing so, they relegated racism to an ideological/irrational phenomenon and thus as extraneous to the core concern of the discipline. In this Annual Review of Political Science article, we refract the discipline's contemporary and historical concerns with democracy through the lens of racial politics to better equip scholars with tools to examine and critically diagnose contemporary politics.",other_topic
"TITLE: Do Personality Traits Predict Voter Attitudes When Politics Is Structured Around Conflict? Lessons from Israel
ABSTRACT: The relationship between personality traits and political attitudes has been studied extensively. However, existing accounts largely study personality’s links to liberal-conservative divisions on social and economic issues. We know far less about its attitudinal influences when politics is organized around other issue domains, particularly ethnonational conflicts. Addressing this gap, we examine the relationship between the Big Five personality traits, policy preferences, and political orientation in Israel, where the main ideological cleavage involves the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Using original survey data, we find that the known relationships with social and economic attitudes operate only partly and more weakly in this context. Unlike these domains, conflict-related preferences in Israel correlate primarily with greater conscientiousness, largely through authoritarian tendencies. General Left-Right orientations mimic this relationship, reflecting conflict-related views rather than social or economic inclinations. These findings expand the scope of current debates about personality and political attitudes and underscore the importance of national ideological contexts for future research.",other_topic
"TITLE: Social Rigidity Across and Within Generations: A Predictive Approach
ABSTRACT: How well can individuals’ parental background and previous life experiences predict their mid-life socioeconomic status (SES) attainment? This question is central to stratification research, as a strong power of earlier experiences in predicting later-life outcomes signals substantial intra- or intergenerational status persistence, or put simply, social rigidity. Running machine learning models on panel data to predict outcomes that include hourly wage, total income, family income, and occupational status, we find that a large number (around 4,000) of predictors commonly used in the stratification literature improves the prediction of one’s life chances in middle to late adulthood by about 10 percent to 50 percent, compared with a null model that uses a simple mean of the outcome variable. The level of predictability depends on the specific outcome being analyzed, with labor market indicators like wages and occupational prestige being more predictable than broader socioeconomic measures such as overall personal and family income. Grouping a comprehensive list of predictors into four unique sets that cover family background, childhood and adolescence development, early labor market experiences, and early adulthood family formation, we find that including income, employment status, and occupational characteristics at early career significantly improves models’ prediction accuracy for mid-life SES attainment. We also illustrate the application of the predictive models to examine heterogeneity in predictability by race and gender and identify important variables through this data-driven exercise.",other_topic
"TITLE: Bent into Submission? Domestic Investors and Populist Governments
ABSTRACT: Do populist governments bend their economic policies to the preferences of bondholders? Populist governments should be a “least likely” case for the market discipline hypothesis. Populist parties typically run on platforms that scapegoat wealthy elites as “enemies of the people” and hence should be more resistant to changing policy positions in the face of market pressure, given their reluctance to alienate their base. Employing most-different case studies of the Five Star Movement/Lega coalition in Italy and Viktor Orbán’s government in Hungary, we find that populists do bend to market pressure but that this “disciplining effect” does not stem primarily from foreign investors. Rather, it was the inaction of domestic investors in bond auctions that caused these governments to reverse course on headline economic policies. Because domestic investors served as both governments’ “buyers of last resort,” they needed to maintain their favor amidst foreign capital flight.",other_topic
"TITLE: Where to place sensitive questions? Experiments on survey response order and measures of discriminatory attitudes
ABSTRACT: In survey experiments, should all covariates be administered before the experimental treatment? Some scholars argue that post-treatment items should never be used as covariates because the treatment could bias the measurement of those items and disrupt experimental randomization. Other scholars argue certain items—specifically sensitive questions measuring prejudice—should not be administered pre-treatment. They argue if asked pre-treatment, these items may prime respondents in ways that will influence how they engage with the experiment treatment, thereby affecting the overall outcome of the experiment. Using evidence from four studies (two original collections) that vary the placement of sensitive items—pre-treatment, post-treatment, or in a separate wave—we find little evidence that the placement of sensitive items influences the measurement of those items, the experimental outcomes, nor heterogeneously affects the outcome conditional on the treatment. However, we find the placement of sensitive items inconsistently affects the experimental outcome by interacting with both the measurement of the items and the experimental treatment condition. Overall, we find these measures to be robust to where they are administered. It may be best to place items pre-treatment to preserve randomization. If researchers have reason to include sensitive moderators post-treatment, they should transparently discuss this choice and the anticipated trade-offs.",other_topic

ABSTRACT: Many of our everyday life experiences suggest that humans are social individuals who care about themselves and others. Yet, for a long time, the economic discipline has focused on modeling the purely self-interested homo economicus . In this review, we summarize the extensive experimental literature on deviations from such purely self-interested behavior, with a particular focus on attitudes toward inequality and fairness. This literature shows that many individuals are willing to forgo their own economic gain for a fairer distribution of resources. We further illustrate empirical evidence showing that people differ in what they consider to be fair and discuss how these fairness views vary within and across countries.",other_topic
"TITLE: Rural Politics in the United States
ABSTRACT: Scholars of American politics have recently turned their attention to rural politics, aiming to understand the late twentieth and early twenty-first century nationwide shift of white rural voters to the Republican Party and the ensuing rural–urban political divide. We review research that assesses the potential causes of the rise of place-based polarization, including political–economic transformation, racism, ethnocentrism, and the growing salience of social issues. We also consider its consequences, such as increased levels of social polarization and institutional threats to democracy. Most research to date has focused on individuals, whether to specify rural identity and its correlates or to probe public opinion and political behavior. We recommend that scholars broaden their scope of inquiry to include factors at the meso and macro levels by studying the interplay between place and institutions, public policies, and organizations as well as broader political, economic, and social developments. This will entail attention to change over time. We suggest that scholars resist cordoning off this research area into rural studies and instead engage with broad questions about the functioning of American democracy.",other_topic
"TITLE: Does Affluence Influence Authoritarian Responsiveness? Evidence From Urban China
ABSTRACT: While research on advanced democracies highlights unequal political responsiveness favoring the affluent, less is known about such bias in authoritarian regimes without competitive elections. This paper analyzes how wealth affects bureaucratic responsiveness in an authoritarian context. By matching administrative data on municipal service records with apartment complex-level housing prices in downtown Shanghai, we show mixed findings on unequal responsiveness. Local governments resolve issues faster for residents in wealthier areas, which indicates a priority bias. However, residents in poorer areas receive equally positive resolutions as those in richer neighborhoods. Using interviews and a formal model, we interpret these mixed findings as an outcome of the dual mandates street-level bureaucrats face: efficiency pressure and social stability concerns.",other_topic
"TITLE: Multidimensional social mobility and educational strategies in the UK
ABSTRACT: Recent studies of social mobility inspired by Pierre Bourdieu have sought to move beyond the traditional focus on vertical movement between big classes. Drawing on his language of capitals and social space, and spotlighting access to and differences within the elite, they have demonstrated mobility to be both multidimensional and fine-grained. This paper seeks to synthesise and broaden these developments, taking the UK as its case study. It uses data from the Labour Force Survey from 2021-23 and a multidimensional class scheme to examine absolute rates of vertical, horizontal and diagonal mobility as well as relative odds and pathways of entry to fractions of the higher class linked to social origins. While the results confirm the importance of how much capital one starts with for limiting vertical mobility, they also reveal clear differences according to the preponderant type of capital people start with, as well as gender and ethnicity, that indicate specific strategies of social reproduction and ascent. I finish by calling for a consolidation and elaboration of a Bourdieusian research programme on social mobility.",other_topic
"TITLE: Betting on Partisanship: Biased Information Processing and Opinion Change on a Citizen Initiative
ABSTRACT: How do voters make up their minds when voting on a citizens’ initiative? Motivated reasoning theory makes a strong case for a partisan bias in the way citizens process information, but empirical evidence is mixed. We offer a more systematic test of the “party over policy” argument by integrating prior attitudes into the analysis of how voters respond to cues and policy information. Results of a survey experiment with pre-post measures of vote intentions on a California citizen initiative on online sports betting in 2022 provide support for partisan motivated reasoning. Regardless of the direction of policy information, voters who change their minds tend to follow the cue of their preferred party, even when the cue contradicts their initial vote intention. These results have important normative and practical implications.",other_topic
"TITLE: When Sexism Becomes the Norm: The Effect of Sexism on Women’s Participation in Political Online Discussions
ABSTRACT: Publicly visible women in political news are often met with sexist backlash in social media’s comment sections. We take a social norms perspective to argue that the presence of politically active women in the news sets a descriptive norm to increase female social media users’ participation in online discussions (role model hypothesis). However, sexist comments against visible women function as signals of injunctive norms and decrease participation (sexist backlash hypothesis). A preregistered nested-stimuli experiment with a sample of German women provided no support for the role model hypothesis but some support for the adverse effects of sexist attacks. The findings indicate that the increase of women in prominent public positions might harm, instead of nourish, women’s discursive participation intention as long as the sexist backlash against women in public roles prevails.",other_topic
"TITLE: Competing for workers’ representation: established and grassroots unions in the Italian logistics sector
ABSTRACT: Employment conditions for low-skilled workers are deteriorating across all European countries, leading to the emergence of grassroots unions alongside more established labour organizations. Despite the increasing union heterogeneity characterising corporativist Southern European countries in particular, inter-union relationships have never been emphasised in previous studies. Our article explores the evolving relational landscape of employee representation and its impact on effective advocacy for low-skilled workers. In conducting a multiple case study research design within the Italian logistics sector, we rely on the concepts of frames and power resources to understand inter-union relationships and their consequences for workers’ concerns. Our results show how grassroot unions and established unions are characterised by deep frame contestation in terms of ideational incompatibility. The studied grassroots union adopted radical frames emphasising labour–capital struggles, while established unions employed a more moderate ’just balance’ approach, pursuing dialogue with firms. In line with this, the grassroots union made much stronger use of structural and associational power resources, while the established union used a wider variety of such resources. This dynamic fostered heightened competition and antagonism between the unions. However, our results also suggest that this antagonism inadvertently resulted in a positive division of labour that revealed a complementarity between different union framings in addressing workers’ concerns.",other_topic
"TITLE: ‘Men’s Parties’, but With More Active Women: Gender and Party Activism in the Populist Radical Right
ABSTRACT: While the gender gap among populist radical right (PRR) voters and representatives has been extensively investigated, little is known about the extent to which women are active as PRR party members. To examine this, I ask: How and why does party activism in PRR parties differ between women and men? Based on the literature on gender and party politics, I expect women PRR party members to be less active than men because they have less motivations to participate, are less embedded in party networks, and are more sensitive to stigma. Drawing on original survey data from thousands of members of the League in Italy and the Sweden Democrats, I find that women PRR party members are overall more active than men because they are more embedded in party networks. This surprising result has important implications for our understanding of women’s participation in parties and the growing normalisation of PRR politics.",other_topic
"TITLE: Estimating the extent and sources of model uncertainty in political science
ABSTRACT: Assessing model uncertainty is crucial to quantitative political science. Yet, most available sensitivity analyses focus only on a few modeling choices, most notably the covariate space, while neglecting to jointly consider several equally important modeling choices simultaneously. In this article, we combine the exhaustive and systematic method of the Extreme Bounds Analysis with the more multidimensional logic underpinning the multiverse approach to develop an approach to sensitivity analyses. This allows us to systematically assess the degree and sources of model uncertainty across multiple dimensions, including the control set, fixed effect structures, SE types, sample selection, and dependent variable operationalization. We then apply this method to four prominent topics in political science: democratization, institutional trust, public good provision, and welfare state generosity. Results from over 3.6 bn estimates reveal widespread model uncertainty, not just in terms of the statistical significance of the effects, but also their direction, with most independent variables yielding a substantive share of statistically significant positive and negative coefficients depending on model specification. We compare the strengths and weaknesses of three distinct approaches to estimating the relative importance of different model specification choices: nearest 1-neighbor; logistic; and deep learning. All three approaches reveal that the impact of the covariate space is relatively modest compared to the impact of sample selection and dependent variable operationalization. We conclude that model uncertainty stems more from sampling and measurement than conditioning and discuss the methodological implications for how to assess model uncertainty in the social sciences.",other_topic
"TITLE: Equality takes work: a process to understand why women still do most of the household labor
ABSTRACT: In the United States, widespread support for gender egalitarianism in the household contrasts with the pattern that women continue to do more household labor than men in different-sex relationships. Existing scholarship has revealed the ways in which different-sex couples justify these unequal arrangements. However, we know little about why women do more labor even when they have egalitarian goals and few structural constraints. I address this question by examining whether and how couples attempt to achieve equality and why they so often fail. Data from 40 in-depth interviews with members of 20 cisgender, different-sex, college-educated couples show that, because unequal household labor patterns are so entrenched, having an egalitarian division of labor itself requires work. I theorize and provide evidence for a process I call “equality work,” the work of creating an egalitarian division of labor, which often falls on women. Equality work includes anticipating inequality, strategizing to avoid it, monitoring equality, speaking up about inequality, fixing unequal outcomes, and withholding work. When men don’t strive for equality, women preserve the relationship by doing the labor their partners do not and revising their ideals. Equality work helps us better understand why women do most of the household labor; paradoxically, doing less requires that women work as well. These findings suggest that women are not passively accepting unequal household arrangements but striving to change them.",other_topic
"TITLE: Types of pandemic-induced psychological distress, clarity of responsibility, and support for incumbents
ABSTRACT: Will voters punish incumbents for psychological distress associated with public policy during external shocks? This study examines this question in the empirical context of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in India, utilizing three novel cross-sectional surveys conducted in the first three weeks of June 2020, immediately after the national lockdown policy was officially revoked. We find that propensity to vote for the nationally incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (if hypothetical elections were held on the day of the survey) was negatively correlated with mental stress from routine disruptions in mobility (Week 1); worsening mental health (Week 2); and emotion-focused coping (Week 3). We show that these effects are strongest in BJP-ruled states. We argue that psychological distress shaped political attitudes in the midst of the pandemic and this effect was conditional on the source of distress and moderated by governmental clarity of responsibility.",other_topic
"TITLE: Partisan preferences for antitrust policy
ABSTRACT: Industrial concentration has increased in recent years with large companies consolidating their dominant positions. Concentrated markets are thought to benefit large firms as they earn elevated profits and gain political influence. Antitrust law is the main policy tool to reduce concentration. Calls to strengthen antitrust have come from the political left and the right, yet we know little about public support for such policies. We test how economic, moral, and democratic concerns influence support for antitrust. We find that the public does not respond to the consumer price benefits of antitrust but is moved by arguments invoking concerns for fairness and the importance of maintaining democratic institutions. We find that Republicans and Democrats often respond in divergent ways, with Republicans being less supportive of antitrust when informed that it could punish successful companies, whereas Democrats are more concerned about using antitrust to curb corporate influence. The findings accord with a general concern on the left for limiting business influence in politics and a concern on the right for maintaining business growth.",other_topic
"TITLE: My Parents and Me: Navigating the Role of Intergenerational Transmission on Policy Feedback
ABSTRACT: This study investigates the intergenerational transmission mechanisms of policy feedback, focusing on how past policies influence citizens' behavioral intentions across generations in the context of China's fertility policy changes. Using data from the China Family Panel Studies, we investigate how experiences with the one‐child policy affect individuals' intentions under the current pro‐natalist policy. Logistic regression analysis reveals that individuals whose parents complied with the one‐child policy are less likely to intend to have more than one child. This effect is mediated by the weakening of traditional beliefs, such as “raising children for old age” and “continuation of family lineage.” A regression discontinuity design further confirms that individuals with parents subjected to stricter birth control measures exhibit lower intentions to have more children. These findings underscore the significance of intergenerational transmission in shaping citizens' attitudes and highlight the lasting impact of historical policy experiences on contemporary policy outcomes.",other_topic
"TITLE: Social Desirability and Political Sensitivity: Interviewer Gender Effects on Men in Five Arab Countries
ABSTRACT: Survey research is growing, yet research on data quality continues to rely mainly on samples from the United States and Europe. To contribute, we test for interviewer gender effects on men in the Middle East and North Africa, where studies of data quality are particularly scarce. Theoretically, we focus on the implications of less gender-egalitarian contexts for response tendencies. For questions about politics and government, we find that men respondents tend to provide more socially desirable responses to men interviewers, offering “safer” and more pro-regime answers. Yet, for questions that touch on their own social status, such as self-reported income and religiosity, they appear to offer more socially desirable responses to women interviewers. The findings strengthen the case for comparative investigations of data quality, and highlight the value of contextual knowledge about politics and gender relations.",other_topic
"TITLE: Citizenship, sex work and taxes: perspective from three European contexts
ABSTRACT: This article explores the overlooked nexus between taxation and sex work, approaching it as a vehicle for examining the conditions under which sex workers are legible to themselves, the state, and others as full citizens. Bringing together sex work, taxation and citizenship studies, this is the first study to consider sex workers' perspectives on the fiscal regimes in which they operate, and how they negotiate and make sense of the challenges they face in relation to paying taxes. We draw on rich qualitative data collected through interviews with sex workers based in three European contexts with different legal and fiscal approaches to sex work: Italy, Portugal and the Swiss canton Geneva. The article reveals that taxes play various roles in the lives, experiences and imaginations of our participants, reflecting different positions and dispositions towards the state, and different aspirations and visions of full citizenship. We show that the ability or inability to pay taxes as a sex worker cannot be separated from the wider legal contexts that grant (or not) rights to sex workers, and from the stigma of sex work that remains pervasive, especially for minoritised groups. Taxation plays an important role in sex workers' lives and in the relationship between sex workers and the state but it can only be one element of many when considering what full citizenship for sex workers might look like.",other_topic
"TITLE: Expert Knowledge in Democracies: Promises, Limits, and Conflict
ABSTRACT: The article reviews recent literature on bureaucratic experts as political actors in democracies, with a focus on their complex, sometimes conflictive relationships with politicians. First, we present the central promises of expertise for democratic governance: its alleged objectivity, responsiveness to the common good, and effectiveness. Then, we look into two criticisms of this optimistic and apolitical view: Expertise is neither as unbiased nor as effective as claimed. Building on a more political understanding of experts’ power in democracies, we then discuss two topics that illustrate experts’ relationships with politicians: ( a ) the conditions and political dynamics that cause changes in technical policy areas’ influence, preferences, and institutional arrangements (or even experts’ demise) and ( b ) how challenging experts’ power is for democracy and elected politicians. We conclude with suggestions for future research and a call to find more common ground between the literatures focusing on experts and politics.",other_topic
"TITLE: High Skills for High Tech: Higher Education as Industrial Policy
ABSTRACT: How do states create the skills needed for high technology economic activities that hold an increasingly important role in contemporary societies? Examining economic statecraft in the higher education sector, this article shows that the policies employed by governments to expand the supply of high skills vary depending on their economies' most advanced sectors. Governments who seek to meet the demand of the high‐end services sectors pursue a strategy of “open‐ended” higher education expansion. “Targeted” expansion of higher education, instead, is the preferred option for governments in countries characterized by large advanced manufacturing sectors. The latter strategy, however, is hampered by the presence of a partly private higher education system since the ability of governments to successfully pursue their strategies is mediated by the existing institutional framework in the realm of higher education policy. Empirically, the argument finds strong support through three country case studies—Germany, South Korea, and the United Kingdom—that allow to simultaneously leverage a most‐similar and most‐different research design.",other_topic
"TITLE: Underneath the Surface: Unpacking Gendered Dynamics in Legislative Oversight in Italian Municipalities
ABSTRACT: A growing strand of research investigates how women behave in office. While previous studies have explored women's engagement in policy‐making and representation, less is known about their engagement in legislative oversight, particularly at the local level, a critical area for female representation. This paper adapts existing theories to the local context, presenting two opposing arguments: on the one hand, women may engage more actively in legislative oversight; on the other, traditional gender norms may hinder their effectiveness as legislators. We also hypothesize that women's oversight engagement may depend on the number of female councillors present. Using novel survey data from Italian municipal councillors, our findings indicate that women engage less frequently than men in legislative oversight. Additionally, as the share of female councillors increases, individual female councillors become less likely to engage in oversight activities, likely due to backlash from male colleagues seeking to reassert dominance as women's representation grows.",other_topic
"TITLE: Information and Perceptions of Electability in Primary Elections
ABSTRACT: When citizens vote in primary elections, they have good reason to consider each candidate’s electability —the chances of winning the general election if they become their party’s nominee. Although electability perceptions are potentially a critical determinant of who wins, little is known about how voters form such perceptions. Using a pre-registered survey experiment conducted on voters in advance of several real competitive senatorial and gubernatorial primary elections in 2022, we examine three candidate attributes that plausibly shape and are correlated with voters’ perceptions of electability: ideological moderation, experience in elected office, and campaign fundraising success. We find evidence that providing new information about candidate attributes affects perceptions of electability, with fundraising being most important. Subsequent analysis shows that this effect is largely driven by Republican voters. Our results highlight the need to better understand differences across the parties in perceptions of electability and how voters learn about campaign finance information.",other_topic
"TITLE: Losing Touch: The Rhetorical Cost of Governing
ABSTRACT: The electoral ‘cost of governing’ is widely considered a law-like phenomenon. However, costs of governing are not limited to the electoral dimension. This paper highlights and documents an unappreciated nonelectoral cost of holding government office: diminished rhetorical simplicity. I argue that the functional demands of running government compel government members to speak less simply than is electorally optimal. I refer to this effect as 'the rhetorical cost of governing'. I test this theory using rich data on individual legislator careers and parliamentary speech in Denmark across three decades. Consistent with the theory, government membership reduces rhetorical simplicity. Additional analyses suggest the effect is transitory and is driven by constraints on issue emphasis. I then provide experimental evidence of downstream electoral consequences, showing that respondents prefer politicians using simple language. The results enrich our understanding of the costs of governing, the opposition advantage, and the mass grievances fueling populist political movements.",other_topic
"TITLE: Labor Markets in Developing Countries
ABSTRACT: The process of development is accompanied by marked changes in the structure of the labor market. We lay out a broad set of stylized features that distinguish labor markets in developing countries from those in richer countries. We organize our review around one particularly striking difference: In poor countries, working-age individuals are employed in wage work only 20–50% of the time. There is evidence that this low wage employment reflects high levels of involuntary unemployment (often masked by self-employment) along with frictions such as wage rigidity, market power, and search-and-matching frictions. At the same time, there is growing documentation that workers prefer self-employment or unemployment to many of the wage jobs that are available to them, especially low-skill work in the formal sector. We offer evidence on several ways in which poverty itself can dampen labor supply, so that low labor supply may itself be an outcome of underdevelopment. Throughout our review, we highlight three core aspects of poverty—missing markets, the importance of social ties, and institutional irregularity—that are relevant for understanding how labor markets change in response to, and help facilitate, the process of development.",other_topic
"TITLE: Coercion, Discretion, and the Roberts Court
ABSTRACT: The Roberts court’s immigration jurisprudence has reinforced the discretionary powers of the government and sharply limited constitutional constraints on the exercise of those powers. As a result, the protection of immigrants’ rights increasingly has become a matter of executive grace. Discretion plays a crucial role in the execution of immigration law, and through its use, the executive can promote humanitarian objectives. But even when protective discretionary acts receive the imprimatur of courts, they do not provide lasting security because they are only as good as the policy preferences of the president in power. Indeed, discretion can also perpetuate overly aggressive enforcement in pursuit of those preferences. The checks the Roberts court has imposed on the operation of the enforcement system tend to reflect a skepticism of government, rather than a meaningful regard for the rights and interests of immigrants, leaving Congress as the only meaningful source of stability for the system and for immigrants themselves.",other_topic
"TITLE: Online Political Discussion Under Authoritarianism: What Do Citizens Make of Censored Political Discussion?
ABSTRACT: There is a continuing debate on whether the internet serves as a public sphere for meaningful political discussion and increases political engagement. Yet, we know little about how internet users in authoritarian regimes perceive and experience online political discussion beyond the dominant frame of censorship and surveillance. Based on the first nationally representative survey on internet use in China, this paper examines how citizens view the space for political discussion online and offline and how three types of concerns—repercussions, social desirability, and privacy—shape these perceptions. Results show that Chinese citizens tend to perceive online discussion as more diverse. Those concerned about political repercussions report higher perceived diversity in online discussions, while social desirability concerns correlate with greater perceived diversity in both online and offline settings. Only those concerned for exposure of personal information perceive online political discussion as more uniform. These findings advance understandings of citizen views on political discussion in authoritarian contexts and contribute to broader debates about the role of the internet in political engagement.",other_topic
"TITLE: Correlation Neglect on Social Media: Effects on Civil Service Applications in China
ABSTRACT: Social media, on which signals are often correlated, has become a primary source of information. How do people form beliefs when reading correlated signals online? In a field experiment on Weibo, we exposed Chinese college students to redundant negative posts about civil service jobs. Consequently, students developed a 0.16 standard deviation more negative view of these jobs and were 11% less likely to register for civil service exams, compared to the control group. We find the same effect in a supplemental online survey experiment, and the effect is moderated by attention. Our study demonstrates that correlation neglect can affect beliefs and real-life outcomes, including career choices.",other_topic
"TITLE: Social influence during public crises: Weekly dynamics and adaptive patterns of conformity to the collective following the COVID-19 outbreak
ABSTRACT: Regional collectivism has been observed to contribute to better coping with public crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study poses a reverse question: Does the eruption of public crises increase people’s conformity to the collective? To answer this question, we analyzed real-world transactions on Taobao (the largest e-commerce platform in China), each with a purchase decision and a list of candidates considered before purchasing. Conformity to the collective was measured using two indicators: whether the decision-maker opted for the A) most-sold and B) best-rated options within the candidate option set. The results reveal that both conformity variables were significantly higher in the 10 wk subsequent to January 19, 2020 (when the nationwide COVID-19 crisis erupted in China), than in the 8 wk prior. These shifts were common across subpopulations, regions, and product categories and remained significant after strictly matching across weeks and after using a within-person, longitudinal sample. These shifts were more confidently attributed to the pandemic by further conducting difference-in-differences analyses to compare pandemic-affected regions with their unaffected, comparable counterparts using data from six subsequent regional waves in China. Furthermore, regions with larger increases in conformity during the early stage of the pandemic achieved better antipandemic outcomes. These findings provide real-world evidence for previous theories on behavioral immune systems, terror management, and compensatory control. Additionally, cross-regional comparisons of effect sizes offer exploratory insights into cultural psychology. In summary, these findings capture how human societies dynamically adjust their values to better adapt to unanticipated survival challenges.",other_topic
"TITLE: What is the effect of providing information about the science behind vaccination? A population-based survey-experiment on support for the MMR vaccine
ABSTRACT: This study examines the effects of including information about the scientific research behind vaccination in information provision about the MMR vaccine on societal acceptance and perceived legitimacy of the vaccine. We also test whether these effects are shaped by nature-oriented or science-oriented worldviews. Employing a pre-registered survey experiment conducted among members of a high-quality Dutch panel established using official population register data (n = 1,722), we found that receiving the informational stimulus did not positively affect support for the MMR vaccine. Moreover, providing information explaining the scientific research behind vaccination had a negative effect on support for the MMR-vaccine among those with a less science-oriented worldview.",other_topic
"TITLE: Estimating the persuasive effects of advertising in presidential primary elections
ABSTRACT: Presidential primary elections arguably represent the most dynamic campaigns in American politics. Television advertising is a key aspect of strategy that candidates can marshal throughout the campaign. We develop a methodology for measuring the impact of advertising in primary elections that accounts for endogeneity and apply it to the 2000 through 2016 elections. We find that advertisements—both positive and negative—improve the favorability and the vote share of the candidate running the ads. We find that negative advertising is more effective than positive advertising, but that only high polling candidates lose support when attacked.",other_topic
"TITLE: Interstate conflicts with multiple fronts
ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes an interstate-conflict model in which two states compete for supporters in the governance of a territory on two socioeconomically linked fronts: soft (for example, media persuasion, propaganda) and hard (for example, annexation, invasion). Supporters enjoy an ego premium when their ideological alignment on the soft front matches the outcome on the hard front. A state’s total gain from a conflict is the difference between the economic gains from the hard front and the cost of forming ideological preferences on the soft front. We propose four scenarios based on the relative size of the ego premium and provide intuition on how competition on the soft front becomes widespread. We explore the implications of the model in the context of the Russian–Ukrainian war.",other_topic
"TITLE: Gauging the Impacts of Performance Information Disclosure on Citizen Satisfaction: Quasi‐Experimental Evidence From China
ABSTRACT: Despite extensive research investigating the link between government performance and citizen satisfaction, our understanding is limited regarding whether and how information disclosure affects this relationship in the digital era. This study bridges this gap by examining the interactive effects of information disclosure and performance information on citizen satisfaction. We argue that information disclosure strengthens the “performance–satisfaction” link by aligning citizens' satisfaction evaluations more closely with government performance. Using a staggered difference‐in‐differences design, we analyze individuals' environmental satisfaction from the China Livelihood Survey (2011–2017) across municipalities, while government performance is measured using satellite data and information disclosure timing is sourced from government portals. Findings indicate a consistent relationship between government performance and citizen satisfaction due to information disclosure. Further analyses reveal that this effect is mediated by citizens' information‐seeking behaviors and is particularly pronounced among informationally disadvantaged citizens. This research contributes to understanding the performance–satisfaction relationship in a digital era.",other_topic
"TITLE: Explaining the political strategies of radical left parties in Europe after 2008
ABSTRACT: As consistent critics of neoliberalism, Radical Left parties have enjoyed a unique political position after the 2008 financial crisis. One main factor affecting these parties’ electoral success was whether they adopted more “flexible” political strategies and discourse that could appeal to a broader audience of voters. That raises the question of why only some Radical Left parties have adopted a “flexible” strategy while others have not. This article develops a novel theoretical framework to answer this question, arguing that the strategic choices of Radical Left parties were affected by a set of external conditions - primarily the severity of social and economic conditions and the features of political competition - and internal features - primarily ideological heritage and the degree of party leadership autonomy. Empirically, those findings are based on an extensive in-depth comparative analysis of six Radical Left parties in three countries: Denmark, France, and Spain.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Constraining Effect of “History and Tradition”: A Test
ABSTRACT: The U.S. Supreme Court’s embrace of originalism, and particularly the “history and tradition” method of interpreting constitutional text, is often justified by its defenders as constraining judges from making up the law to match their preferences. This is a testable hypothesis. With the Bruen case in 2022, the Supreme Court moved away from a contemporary means-ends method of interpreting the Second Amendment to an originalist, “history and tradition” one. In this article, we analyze data on gun rights decisions handed down by lower federal courts from 2000 to 2023, finding that the Supreme Court’s switch to an originalist jurisprudence did not, in fact, constrain judges—rather, it corresponds with an increase in judicial discretion. Personal factors like partisan identity, gender, race, and careerist considerations shape judicial behavior in the post- Bruen era in ways they did not under the prior regime.",other_topic
"TITLE: Coping With Competing Institutional Logics in Policy Implementation
ABSTRACT: While recent research has studied the coping behaviors of street‐level bureaucrats (SLBs), less attention has been paid to the institutional antecedents of these coping behaviors. This paper examines how macro‐level institutional factors—specifically, competing institutional logics—shape SLBs' meso‐level organizational conflicts and micro‐level coping behaviors. We use semi‐structured interviews and archival data to investigate environmental policy implementation in China, where developmental state logic and regulatory state logic coexist and compete. We found that regulatory state logic increases SLBs' workloads and accountability, while developmental state logic limits their power and resources. These competing institutional logics result in unclear responsibilities, expanding the number of tasks but constraining resources, creating pressure for enforcement officials while providing few rewards. In response, SLBs engage in active and passive coping behaviors. Our study contributes to public administration and institutional theory research by introducing a multi‐level framework that links competing logics to organizational conflicts and individual coping.",other_topic
"TITLE: What State? Political Parties and Non-State Security Provision in Lebanon
ABSTRACT: Security is the canonical public good provided by the state to its citizens. Yet, many states are incapable or unwilling to provide security in a consistent fashion across their territory. The provision of security, order, and management of crime is a crucial “good” that parties can and do offer their constituents, resulting in widespread variation in security at the neighborhood level. What explains this variation in the provision of security and local policing by political parties? Drawing on 132 semi-structured interviews conducted during eight months of fieldwork in Lebanon, this study suggests that organizational capacity is one determinant of whether political parties step into the role of security providers. It shows that maintaining robust linkages with constituent communities and party members at the local level are necessary to coordinating security measures.",other_topic
"TITLE: Virtue or passion? How moral frames in climate change appeals elicit emotions and change opinions
ABSTRACT: Political climate change debates make use of different moral frames of climate change diagnoses and solutions. While it is argued that moral frames are more effective when they invoke strong moral emotions, thus far the relationship between real‐world political moral viewpoints on climate change and the arousal of related emotions, behavior, and attitudes has not been studied. In this paper, we raise the question of whether existing moral climate frames are effective through emotions (“passion”) or through direct moral persuasion (“virtue”). We compare three viewpoints on the causes of and solutions to climate change: the mainstream, the green‐left, and the populist right viewpoint. Grounded in moral foundations and appraisal theory, we conceptualize these viewpoints on the causes and solutions of the climate crisis as moral appeals embedding appraisals to specific emotions. In the next step, we use these specific appeals as input for a 3 × 2 between‐subjects factorial survey experiment with a control condition among a diverse sample of 1708 Dutch respondents, varying the inclusion of presented diagnoses. Our results show that the effectiveness of moral climate change appeals depends on passion, and that widespread climate action is unlikely based on the most prominent political climate messages.",other_topic

ABSTRACT: We implemented a large-scale randomized controlled trial encompassing 900 junior high schools in Ghana, a country with universal secondary school choice, to study whether providing students and parents information on school characteristics and selection strategies improved outcomes in a centralized school selection mechanism. Information changed households’ preferences and the characteristics of schools to which they applied. Students gained admission to higher value-added schools, yet they were not more likely to matriculate on time or at all. Incomplete school information was not the only friction. Household shocks and inaccurate preference forecasting likely contributed to continued admission deviations.",other_topic
"TITLE: Humans program artificial delegates to accurately solve collective-risk dilemmas but lack precision
ABSTRACT: In an era increasingly influenced by autonomous machines, it is only a matter of time before strategic individual decisions that impact collective goods will also be made virtually through the use of artificial delegates. Through a series of behavioral experiments that combine delegation to autonomous agents and different choice architectures, we pinpoint what may get lost in translation when humans delegate to algorithms. We focus on the collective-risk dilemma, a game where participants must decide whether or not to contribute to a public good, where the latter must reach a target in order for them to keep their personal endowments. To test the effect of delegation beyond its functionality as a commitment device, participants are asked to play the game a second time, with the same group, where they are given the chance to reprogram their agents. As our main result we find that, when the action space is constrained, people who delegate contribute more to the public good, even if they have experienced more failure and inequality than people who do not delegate. However, they are not more successful. Failing to reach the target, after getting close to it, can be attributed to precision errors in the agent’s algorithm that cannot be corrected amid the game. Thus, with the digitization and subsequent limitation of our interactions, artificial delegates appear to be a solution to help preserving public goods over many iterations of risky situations. But actual success can only be achieved if humans learn to adjust their agents’ algorithms.",other_topic
"TITLE: Tracing the evolution of preschool’s impact on education over a century: Spain, 1900-1973
ABSTRACT: Preschool is acknowledged as a strategy for promoting long-term educational attainment and fostering equality of educational opportunities. Most of these expectations are based on evidence from rather recent periods. Leveraging retrospective data from cohorts born between 1900 and 1973 in Spain, we examine the historical evolution of returns to early education and its potential for equalization. We argue that this equalizing potential is contingent upon the degree of selectivity in accessing and completing a specific educational stage. Specifically, only when a given level becomes less selective, does preschool contribute to increased educational equity. Our evidence unveils two novel insights. On the one hand, the magnitude of returns underwent important changes over time, with more recent periods demonstrating diminished payoffs. On the other, the broadly documented equalizing potential of preschool is a function of the selectivity in accessing each educational level, suggesting that preschool has not always been an equalizing investment.",other_topic
"TITLE: Addressing Missingness in Serialized Bureaucratic Data: The Case of Chinese Courts
ABSTRACT: Courts around the world are putting their data online, making information about caseloads, parties, and decisions available to the public. Yet, this data is far from complete, and often only reflects a portion of courts’ dockets. We offer and validate a set of tools for leveraging serialized bureaucratic data from courts to estimate the proportion of cases available to the public and the time courts take to make decisions. Using data from more than 3,000 courts in China, our methods allow us to assess patterns of missingness in court data across provinces and cities by type of case and to conduct the largest quantitative analysis to date on court delay in China. By providing an extensive validation of both new and existing tools for estimating missingness and delay, we provide a set of recommendations for researchers looking to augment incomplete bureaucratic data around the world.",other_topic

I analyze Trump’s public criticisms of judicial rulings that counter his personal interests and his criticism of his own appointees and other Republican-appointed justices who do not always rule in his favor to highlight how the court’s claim of independence is complicated by political science data showing that judges often align with the ideological leanings of the party whose president appointed them. This analysis ultimately reveals a growing disconnect between the judiciary’s stated ideals and the political pressures present in an increasingly polarized environment.",other_topic
"TITLE: Social Media Influencers as “Dirty Workers”: An Explorative Study on How They Use Strategies to Reduce the Moral Taint
ABSTRACT: Since social media influencers have become popular and monetize their content with the help of advertising deals, they have been associated with morally questionable, deceptive behavior. The list of misconduct is long. It includes, for example, not disclosing sponsored content, withholding negative experiences with promoted products, buying fake followers, and promoting false ideals of beauty. Building on the concept of “dirty work” as a theoretical framework, this article asks which strategies influencers use to soften this moral taint. Qualitative interviews with influencers living in Germany show that they are aware of their negative image in public and use various stigma management strategies. This article offers a perspective that has not yet played a role in the ethics debate about influencers. It asks how influencers, who are often associated with morally questionable practices, immunize themselves against this negative image and find a positive work identity.",other_topic
"TITLE: The U.S. Supreme Court’s Legitimacy: How Public Opinion Updates
ABSTRACT: The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling abrogating women’s long-established right to abortion affords an opportunity to better understand how people update their attitudes toward the court. The data analyzed here reinforce evidence from earlier studies that the Dobbs ruling produced a substantial hit to the court’s institutional legitimacy. Why and how did this occur? A dominant model of attitude change posits that short-term evaluations of the court’s performance are informed by individual rulings and readily evolve but that institutional loyalty originates from different sources and is resistant to change. Loyalty is not entirely impervious to change, however: This research suggests that controversial decisions can cause a realignment of both types of court attitudes and that this seems to have happened with Dobbs . But, as I show via an experiment, evaluations typically change first, and under some (but perhaps extraordinary) circumstances, changed evaluations can undermine institutional loyalty.",other_topic
"TITLE: Exploring the Mediating Role of Online Social Capital in the Association Between Sharing Memes Using Four Humor Styles and Subjective Well-Being
ABSTRACT: Sharing memes has emerged as a prevalent form of social grooming behavior on digital platforms, yet research has largely focused on the content of internet memes rather than the behavior of sharing them. This study explores whether sharing memes with different humor styles (affiliative, self-enhancing, aggressive, and self-defeating humor styles) relates to subjective well-being through the mediating roles of online bonding and bridging social capital. Using survey data from a representative sample of 1000 participants in the United States, the findings showed that affiliative and aggressive meme-sharing were positively associated with psychological well-being and positive feelings via enhanced online bonding social capital. The findings could contribute to a deeper understanding of social and psychological implications of engaging with memes in online communication.",other_topic
"TITLE: Understanding Intimate Partner Violence
ABSTRACT: Violence against women occurs at high rates in societies across the world. The most common form is intimate partner violence, abuse perpetrated against a spouse or intimate relationship partner. We present a household bargaining model that seeks to clarify causal mechanisms and to identify key pathways by which economic, political, legal, and cultural factors external to households influence domestic abuse rates, gender equity within relationships, and rates of relationship dissolution. We relate key parameters to factors that differ across societies and over time, including economic opportunities for women, laws that criminalize domestic abuse, and social norms associated with gender equality. We review research associated with these topics to establish what we know and do not know about violence against women in households. While much of this literature is outside of the field of political science, we highlight opportunities for political scientists to contribute to our understanding of how and why domestic violence persists in the world today.",other_topic
"TITLE: Deep mechanism design: Learning social and economic policies for human benefit
ABSTRACT: Human society is coordinated by mechanisms that control how prices are agreed, taxes are set, and electoral votes are tallied. The design of robust and effective mechanisms for human benefit is a core problem in the social, economic, and political sciences. Here, we discuss the recent application of modern tools from AI research, including deep neural networks trained with reinforcement learning (RL), to create more desirable mechanisms for people. We review the application of machine learning to design effective auctions, learn optimal tax policies, and discover redistribution policies that win the popular vote among human users. We discuss the challenge of accurately modeling human preferences and the problem of aligning a mechanism to the wishes of a potentially diverse group. We highlight the importance of ensuring that research into “deep mechanism design” is conducted safely and ethically.",other_topic
"TITLE: Community Enforcement with Endogenous Records
ABSTRACT: I study repeated games with anonymous random matching where players can add or remove signals from their records. The ability to manipulate records introduces monotonicity constraints on players’ continuation values, under which sufficiently long-lived players will almost never cooperate. When players’ expected lifespans are intermediate, their ability to sustain cooperation depends on (i) whether their actions are complements or substitutes and (ii) whether manipulation takes the form of adding or removing signals.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Supreme Outlier: How SCOTUS Stands Out Among Global Apex Courts
ABSTRACT: How a country’s apex court functions and how its justices decide cases is shaped by its institutional design and history and by the political and cultural context in which it sits. I compare the apex courts of 38 Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, finding that the power and role of the U.S. Supreme Court (SCOTUS) makes it unique among them. SCOTUS’s appointment process, lifelong judicial terms, agenda-setting powers, consensus norms, and constitutional framework make it an exceptionally powerful and exceptionally partisan court. Further, several factors that encourage a tendency toward the protection of rights in other apex courts are less relevant to SCOTUS. This comparison highlights that SCOTUS is the most partisan of the OECD apex courts, among the most powerful, and relatively less likely than other courts to uphold core democratic principles.",other_topic
"TITLE: Women's Suffrage: Causes and Consequences
ABSTRACT: From 2000 to 2020, more than 20 countries marked a century of women's suffrage. These anniversaries occurred alongside a period of rich theoretical innovation in the democratization literature, producing a decade of research on the causes and consequences of women's suffrage. This body of research pushes against the narrative that suffrage happened automatically with modernization and the claims that early women voters were apathetic and conservative and did not get what they wanted out of politics. New scholarship reveals how political competition and suffragists’ strategies were key components of suffrage reform and how women, who often cast the largest number of votes in any given context, could shift the balance toward left parties if they were highly mobilized in cities. Finally, a growing body of scholarship has shown how suffrage led to expansions of early welfare state policies. Future work should examine these dynamics in suffrage's second wave and outside of the global North.",other_topic
"TITLE: How media competition fuels the spread of misinformation
ABSTRACT: Competition among news sources over public opinion can incentivize them to resort to misinformation. Sharing misinformation may lead to a short-term gain in audience engagement but ultimately damages the credibility of the source, resulting in a loss of audience. To understand the rationale behind news sources sharing misinformation, we model the competition between sources as a zero-sum sequential game, where news sources decide whether to share factual information or misinformation. Each source influences individuals based on their credibility, the veracity of the article, and the individual’s characteristics. We analyze this game through the concept of quantal response equilibrium, which accounts for the bounded rationality of human decision-making. The analysis shows that the resulting equilibria reproduce the credibility-opinion distribution of real-world news sources, with hyperpartisan sources spreading the majority of misinformation. Our findings provide insights for policymakers to mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote a more factual information landscape.",other_topic
"TITLE: Embedded regulation: the knowledge networks that enable electricity decarbonization
ABSTRACT: Since the 1980s, the idea that designed markets function best as self-sufficient systems detached from government and society has been a cornerstone of the electricity sector’s liberalization programs. However, technological advancements and political mandates for decarbonization bring new opportunities to challenge this thesis. This article clarifies why the arrangements of knowledge exchange networks are relevant to understand the governance of designed markets. The arrangement of regulator’s social embeddedness matters, independently of market structure. This research leverages the comparison of three countries with markedly different models of electricity governance—Chile, China, and Mexico—to explore how governments manufacture the conditions for robust action in industrial governance. The analysis reveals three distinct forms of reconfiguration of knowledge networks, forming new expert organizations, appropriating expert organizations owned by the industry, and diversifying the nature of knowledge exchange relations. The institutional approach to solve governing challenges by further embedding regulators, rather than liberalizing markets.",other_topic
"TITLE: Macroevolutionary analysis of polysynthesis shows that language complexity is more likely to evolve in small, isolated populations
ABSTRACT: Evolution of complexity in human languages has been vigorously debated, including the proposal that complexity can build in small, isolated populations but is often lost in situations of language contact. If it is generally true that small, isolated languages can build morphological complexity over time, but complexity tends to be lost in situations of language contact, then we should find that forms of language complexity that have evolved multiple times will tend to be associated with population size, isolation, and language age. We test this hypothesis by focusing on one particular form of morphological complexity, polysynthesis, where words built from many parts embody complex phrases. By assembling a global database of polysynthetic languages and conducting phylospatial analyses, we show that languages with highly complex word morphology are more likely to have small population sizes, less likely to occur with many other languages in direct contact, and have a greater tendency to be on long phylogenetically isolated lineages. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that languages that evolve in isolation for long periods may be more likely to accrue morphological complexity. Polysynthetic languages also tend to have higher levels of endangerment. Our results provide phylogenetically informed evidence that one particular form of complex language morphology is more likely to occur in small, isolated languages and is prone to loss in contact.",other_topic
"TITLE: From #MelaninMansion to #BlackTikTokStrike: Black TikTok, Joy, and the Politics of Refusal
ABSTRACT: In this article, we critically analyze TikTok videos related to the #MelaninMansion trend and the #BlackTikTokStrike. Videos analyzed were posted during the hashtags’ peak engagement, 2019–2020, and the summer of 2021, respectively. Drawing from Black cyberfeminism and literatures on Black cyberculture, platform politics, visibility, affect, resistance, refusal, and copyright, we identified shared themes and thematic differences between the hashtags. Based on these findings, we argue #MelaninMansion and #BlackTikTokStrike illustrate two significant moments on TikTok for Black creators, and a marked change in their tactical and affective response to on-platform racism, appropriation, and content theft. We contend the messaging and imaginings found in the videos reveal Black TikTok’s negative experiences on-platform and their understanding of potential technological and policy solutions. We especially note the affective change during the strike, where Black TikTok creators turn from humorous utopian imaginings of on-platform equity and celebrations of Blackness and community, to frustrated refusal of on-platform labor and pessimistic reflections on the (im)possibilities for Black content creation. Despite the sharp turn in tactics and expectations, content from both moments reflects a commitment to Black joy and intracommunity support. We argue our findings reveal how the TikTok platform and non-Black TikTok community together create a toxic technoculture rife with the violence of racism, cultural appropriation, and creative theft. Finally, we note the centrality of Black women to these viral moments, how #BlackTikTokStrike especially centered Black women’s labor and creativity, and that despite this, Black women performed an outsized amount of labor during the strike.",other_topic
"TITLE: Revolution as Mass-Based Regime Change
ABSTRACT: This article makes the case for a broad definition of revolution as mass-based regime change. Recent years have seen an outpouring of research on mass mobilization, responding in part to a succession of global revolutionary waves. But this scholarship has flourished despite conceptual dissensus, with works embracing an array of partly overlapping terms (e.g., uprising, rebellion, civil resistance). Revolution offers a clear and tractable way of characterizing the full range of these mass movements, while still allowing for conceptual narrowing with adjectives. It also provides a conceptual link to related literatures on authoritarianism and democratization, which characterize mass-based regime change as one of the main threats dictators face. After making these arguments, I demonstrate the utility of this broad definition by reviewing two active debates regarding different forms of revolution: the relative merits of nonviolent versus violent resistance and the types of democracy emerging from democratic revolution versus elite-led negotiations.",other_topic
"TITLE: Law and Infrastructure: Reliability, Automation Transition, and Irregularities of “U‐Space”
ABSTRACT: The European Union (EU) is making regulatory efforts to allow for the safe integration of drones into civilian airspace through automated means. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/664 concerning unmanned traffic management (a system referred to as “U‐Space”) furthers that commitment. Accordingly, drone operators must avail themselves of automatic traffic‐related “U‐Space services” concerning flight authorization, geo awareness, traffic information, and network identification before entering U‐Space airspace. Using infrastructural analysis, as proposed within Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article shows that while automation is meant to ensure safe traffic, it could also challenge U‐Space safety in at least three ways: by inviting reliability concerns for U‐Space infrastructure; because of the transition from human‐centric to automation‐centric systems; and by being subject to irregularities within the EU's framework. An infrastructural analysis, therefore, helps in unveiling important factors which influence the safety of automated technologies and in critically discussing the role of law in their regulation.",other_topic
"TITLE: Take caution in using LLMs as human surrogates
ABSTRACT: Recent studies suggest large language models (LLMs) can generate human-like responses, aligning with human behavior in economic experiments, surveys, and political discourse. This has led many to propose that LLMs can be used as surrogates or simulations for humans in social science research. However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Nearly all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models. The causes of failure are diverse and unpredictable, relating to input language, roles, safeguarding, and more. These results warrant caution in using LLMs as surrogates or for simulating human behavior in research.",other_topic
"TITLE: An American research crisis with real human consequences
ABSTRACT: Ivy League universities have dominated recent news headlines, having become popular targets for critics of higher education. But the threats they face—cuts to federal research funding, assaults on academic freedom, and bans on admitting international students—extend far beyond their campuses. Research universities across the country—large and small, public and private—are grappling with these same pressures. These institutions are behind the breakthroughs that shape daily lives. Undermining them doesn’t just jeopardize higher education, it threatens national and global strength. This means that economic, technological, and intellectual collapse is inevitable if US research institutions fall to federal and state disinvestment.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Supreme Court: How Did We Get Here? And What Comes Next?
ABSTRACT: The politics of appointments have transformed the U.S. Supreme Court in recent years. We examine why and how the current conservative supermajority on the court came to be, with a particular focus on how this court stands apart from earlier ones. We trace the factors that allowed President Donald Trump to reshape the court with his three appointments in his first term and evaluate the importance of the conservative supermajority by connecting it to theories of the court’s collective decision-making. We show that the current court is the culmination of a “partisan sort” in appointments—a strict correlation between party and ideology—that began a few decades ago but did not fully crystallize until the 2010s. Finally, we summarize simulations that show why conservatives are likely to control the court for several decades.",other_topic
"TITLE: Is the Business of the Court (Still) Business?
ABSTRACT: The Roberts court has long been characterized as a “probusiness” court, given the ostensible orientation of the court’s Republican-appointed majority and assumptions that President Trump’s appointments have magnified that orientation. But there are reasons to question this characterization. Quantitative analyses often fail to account for the relative importance of individual decisions, the broader legal context in which the court’s decisions are made, or the ways in which decisions can alter or depart from preexisting legal baselines. I show that President Trump’s appointments to the court have fairly consistently voted to restrain the power of administrative agencies, but they have not consistently supported outcomes that are beneficial to business. In cases involving state laws that may fragment or burden national markets, the Roberts court may actually be less sympathetic to business interests than it was prior to Trump’s appointments.",other_topic
"TITLE: Is Chief Justice John Roberts an Institutionalist? A Historical Institutionalist Analysis
ABSTRACT: Chief Justice John Roberts is often called an “institutionalist,” indicating that he places the good of the Supreme Court as a governing institution over his own political preferences. This description is true only to a limited extent. The historical institutionalist analysis presented here shows that Roberts’s priority is to advance his version of the modern conservative legal movement’s vision of the Constitution, and that he protects the judiciary as an institution in the service of that cause. But because many Americans do not share that vision of constitutionalism, and because its endorsement of executive power may undermine judicial authority, the decisions of the Roberts court may only compound the difficulties facing both the court and the country today. I also discuss implications of the Chief Justice’s disposition, both for the court and for the nation’s evolving conception of constitutionalism.",other_topic
"TITLE: Race, Affirmative Action, Antidiscrimination, and the Roberts Court
ABSTRACT: The Supreme Court’s 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard realizes conceptions about race and the post–Civil War amendments present in the Roberts court’s jurisprudence for several years including, notably, deep skepticism about the continuing need for civil rights remedies and a reading of colorblindness as the core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment. Conservative litigation groups and the Trump administration are now using the SFFA decision to challenge race-conscious affirmative action programs and fundamental racial justice and civil rights laws and policies. While the Supreme Court has so far declined to adopt the farthest-reaching colorblindness arguments and has even expanded the reach of civil rights statutes in certain contexts, the next few years will likely be consequential for racial justice and antidiscrimination law. The court will almost certainly take up cases challenging the constitutionality of long-standing civil rights laws and recent racially reparative efforts.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Roberts Court and Executive Power
ABSTRACT: The current Supreme Court’s jurisprudence on issues of executive power differs markedly depending on the precise type of executive power in question. Although generally taking an expansive view of presidential power, it often seeks to narrow the authority of executive branch administrative agencies, especially those engaged in regulation. This contrast creates an appearance of inconsistency: At the same time that the court is expanding presidential power, it is pulling back on administrative action and thereby denying the presidency one of its most important sources of authority. But the court’s approach is more coherent if it is understood as aimed at implementation of a conservative legal and political agenda. Moreover, by both expanding presidential powers and limiting administrative authority, the court’s decisions aggrandize judicial power at the expense of the political branches.",other_topic
"TITLE: The Dobbs Court
ABSTRACT: Decades of mobilization preceded the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. Yet while the outcome of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization was highly predictable, the decision nonetheless came as a shock to the political and legal systems—and, based on the justices’ first encounters with the post- Dobbs world during the 2023–2024 term, it was perhaps even a shock to the court itself. Women played little more than a walk-on role both in the recognition of a constitutional right to abortion (a decision essentially about doctors) and in the repudiation of that right (a decision essentially about fetuses). But now, in the half of the country where even medically necessary abortion is unavailable after Dobbs , concerns for pregnant women and their fate dominate, and the justices appear no longer so certain that they are finished with abortion. Their work, in fact, may be just beginning.",other_topic
