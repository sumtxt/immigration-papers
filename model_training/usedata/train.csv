"TITLE: Opening the Door: Migration and Self-Selection in a Restrictive Legal Immigration Regime
ABSTRACT: Does opening the door to U.S. citizenship for unauthorized immigrants cause out- of-control ``chain migration''? We address this question using variation from the legalization programs of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (IRCA). Exploiting IRCA's introduction and differences across metropolitan areas in program intensity, we estimate that each IRCA-legalized Mexican was responsible for the subsequent immigration and legal admission of one relative -- in total -- through 2019. Most sponsored relatives were immediate family, and the adult sponsorship rate is inconsistent with out-of-control chain migration. Estimates using cross-country variation are substantively similar and suggest limited demand for reunification of extended families.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: Trade-Offs Between Equality and Difference: Immigrant Integration, Multiculturalism and the Welfare State in Cross-National Perspective
ABSTRACT: This paper investigates how integration policies and welfare-state regimes have affected the socio-economic integration of immigrants, focusing on eight European countries: Germany, France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, Austria and Belgium. It presents comparative data on integration policies and welfare-state regimes. The expectations derived from this comparative policy analysis are tested with cross-national data on integration outcomes regarding labour market participation, spatial segregation and incarceration. The results suggest that multicultural policies---which grant immigrants easy access to equal rights and do not provide strong incentives for host-country language acquisition and interethnic contacts---when combined with a generous welfare state, have produced low levels of labour market participation, high levels of segregation and a strong overrepresentation of immigrants among those convicted for criminal behaviour. Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, which have combined multicultural policies with a strong welfare state, display relatively poor integration outcomes. Countries that either had more restrictive or assimilationist integration policies (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France) or a relatively lean welfare state (the United Kingdom) have achieved better integration results. These differences are highly consistent across the three domains of integration that are examined, with the exception of segregation rates in the United Kingdom.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Local Demographic Changes and US Presidential Voting, 2012 to 2016
ABSTRACT: Immigration and demographic change have become highly salient in American politics, partly because of the 2016 campaign of Donald Trump. Previous research indicates that local influxes of immigrants or unfamiliar ethnic groups can generate threatened responses, but has either focused on nonelectoral outcomes or analyzed elections in large geographic units, such as counties. Here, we examine whether demographic changes at low levels of aggregation were associated with vote shifts toward an anti- immigration presidential candidate between 2012 and 2016. To do so, we compile a precinct-level dataset of election results and demographic measures for almost 32,000 precincts in the states of Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. We employ regression analyses varying model spec- ifications and measures of demographic change. Our estimates uncover little evidence that influxes of Hispanics or noncitizen immigrants benefited Trump relative to past Republicans, instead consistently showing that such changes were associated with shifts to Trump's opponent.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: From Pink-Collar to Lab Coat: Cultural Persistence and Diffusion of Socialist Gender Norms
ABSTRACT: The fall of the Iron Curtain in 1989 led to a massive migration wave from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) to Israel. We document the persistence and transmission of the Soviet unconventional gender norms, both vertically across generations of immigrants, and horizontally through neighborhood and school peer effects. Tracking the educational and occupational choices of a cohort of young Israeli women, we identify the persistence of two important features of the Soviet culture: the prioritization of science and technology, and the strong female attachment to paid-work. Women born in the FSU, who immigrated in infancy, are significantly more likely than natives and other immigrants to major in STEM in high school. In tertiary education, they remain over-represented in STEM, but also differ significantly from other women by their specific avoidance of study fields leading to ""pink collar"" jobs, such as education and social work. They also display a specific choice of work-life balance reflecting a greater commitment to paid-work. Finally, the choice patterns of native women shift towards STEM and away from traditional female study fields as the share of FSU immigrants in their lower-secondary school increases.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: The Regularisation of Unauthorized Migrants: Literature Survey and Country Case Studies
ABSTRACT: Regularisation programmes have emerged in the past 25 years or so as one of the mechanisms States use to account for and manage the undocumented immigrant population in their countries, and are usually implemented in concert with the internal and external strengthening of migration controls. This paper attempts to answer the questions arising from such programmes through a survey of nine regularisation programmes in the United States and the European Union. The first part of the survey offers a broad introduction to, overview and analysis of regularisation programmes through a review of available literature on the topic. The second part of the survey is an in-depth analysis of regularisation programmes in nine countries, and provides for each country a brief overview of their current migration policy, legal channels of immigration into the country, and the undocumented population in relation to the country's demographic profile. In order to provide a complete picture of each programme, throughout the survey an attempt has been made to draw on government, non-governmental and academic sources.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: Group Size Versus Change? Assessing Americans' Perception of Local Immigration
ABSTRACT: Leading opinion research on immigration has begun to move from size-based to change-based measures of citizens' ethnic context. This shift is based on the theoretical assumption that over-time growth in immigrant populations is more likely to capture citizens' attention than their current size. At present, there is no empirical evidence supporting this assumption. This article demonstrates that while the size of local immigrant populations exerts virtually no effect on perceived immigration, over-time growth strongly influences citizens' perceptions of immigration into their community. In addition, our analyses illuminate the differential contribution of growth in local Hispanic and Asian populations to perceived immigration.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: The Political Economy of Immigration Restriction In the United States, 1890 to 1921
ABSTRACT: Anti-immigrant forces almost succeeded in passing restrictive legislation in 1897, but their plan did not ultimately materialize for another twenty years. During that time 17 million Europeans from among the poorest nations came to the United States. This paper explores the economic and political forces that propped the door open for those twenty years, as well as the factors that eventually shut it Economic downturns and their consequent unemployment almost always brought demands for restriction. The flood of immigrants eventually did result in large negative effects on the wages of native-born workers. But the political clout of immigrants was strengthened by the reinforcing nature of their flows. Cities having large numbers of the foreign born received a disproportionate share of immigrants during the 1900 to 1910 period. After 1910, however, immigrant flows were diluting. This factor and the negative impact of immigrants on native wages were important in the passage of restrictionist legislation, although the rural heartland of America was pro-restriction from the l890s.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Political Secularism and Muslim Integration in The West: Assessing the Effects of the French Headscarf Ban
ABSTRACT: In response to rising immigration flows and the fear of Islamic radicalization, several Western countries have enacted policies to restrict religious expression and emphasize secularism and Western values. Despite intense public debate, there is little systematic evidence on how such policies influence the behavior of the religious minorities they target. In this paper, we use rich quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effects of the 2004 French headscarf ban on the socioeconomic integration of French Muslim women. We find that the law reduces the secondary educational attainment of Muslim girls and affects their trajectory in the labor market and family composition in the long run. We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased perceptions of discrimination and that it strengthens both national and religious identities.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: Reducing Exclusionary Attitudes Through Interpersonal Conversation: Evidence From Three Field Experiments
ABSTRACT: Exclusionary attitudes---prejudice toward outgroups and opposition to policies that promote their well-being---are presenting challenges to democratic societies worldwide. Drawing on insights from psychology, we argue that non-judgmentally exchanging narratives in interpersonal conversations can facilitate durable reductions in exclusionary attitudes. We support this argument with evidence from three pre-registered field experiments targeting exclusionary attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters' exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04). Non-judgmentally exchanging narratives can help overcome the resistance to persuasion often encountered in discussions of these contentious topics.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: Trust, Ethnic Diversity, and Personal Contact: A Field Experiment
ABSTRACT: We study how close personal contact with minorities affects in-group and out-group trust in a field experiment in the armed forces. Soldiers are randomly assigned to rooms with or without ethnic minorities. At the end of the recruit period, we measure trust by using a trust game. Results indicate that close personal contact with minorities increases trust towards a generic immigrant. We replicate the result that individuals coming from more ethnically diverse areas trust minorities less, but random assignment to interact with minority soldiers removes this negative correlation. We conclude that social integration involving personal contact can reduce negative effects of ethnic diversity on trust.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: Does Exposure to the Refugee Crisis Make Natives More Hostile?
ABSTRACT: Although Europe has experienced unprecedented numbers of refugee arrivals in recent years, there exists almost no causal evidence regarding the impact of the refugee crisis on natives' attitudes, policy preferences, and political engagement. We exploit a natural experiment in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close to the Turkish coast experienced a sudden and massive increase in refugee arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did not. Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: Refugees' and Irregular Migrants' Self-Selection into Europe: Who Migrates Where?
ABSTRACT: We analyze self-selection of refugees and irregular migrants and test our theory in the context of the European refugee crisis. Using unique datasets from the International Organization for Migration and Gallup World Polls, we provide the first large-scale evidence on reasons to emigrate, and the self-selection and sorting of refugees and irregular migrants. Refugees and female irregular migrants are positively self-selected with respect to human capital, while male irregular migrants are negatively self-selected. These patterns are similar when analyzing individually stated main reason to emigrate, country-level conflict intensity, and sub-regional conflict intensity. Migrants respond to economic incentives and border policies.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: The Labor Market Effects of a Refugee Wave Synthetic Control Method Meets the Mariel Boatlift
ABSTRACT: We apply the Synthetic Control Method to re-examine the labor market effects of the Mariel Boatlift, first studied by David Card (1990). This method improves on previous studies by choosing a control group of cities that best matches Miami's labor market trends pre-Boatlift and providing more reliable inference. Using a sample of non-Cuban high-school dropouts we find no significant difference in the wages of workers in Miami relative to its control after 1980. We also show that by focusing on small sub-samples and matching the control group on a short pre-1979 series, as done in Borjas (2017), one can find large wage differences between Miami and control because of large measurement error.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: Catalyst or Crown: Does Naturalization Promote The Long-Term Social Integration of Immigrants?
ABSTRACT: We study the impact of naturalization on the long-term social integration of immigrants into the host country society. Despite ongoing debates about citizenship policy, we lack reliable evidence that isolates the causal effect of naturalization from the nonrandom selection into naturalization. We exploit the quasi-random assignment of citizenship in Swiss municipalities that used referendums to decide on naturalization applications of immigrants. Comparing otherwise similar immigrants who narrowly won or lost their naturalization referendums, we find that receiving Swiss citizenship strongly improved long-term social integration. We also find that the integration returns to naturalization are larger for more marginalized immigrant groups and when naturalization occurs earlier, rather than later in the residency period. Overall, our findings support the policy paradigm arguing that naturalization is a catalyst for improving the social integration of immigrants rather than merely the crown on the completed integration process.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: Immigration into Europe: Economic Discrimination, Violence, and Public Policy
ABSTRACT: Immigration has irreversibly changed Western European demographics over the past generation. This article reviews recent research drawing implications of this migration for labor-market discrimination and for immigrant--state and immigrant--native violence. It further reports on research measuring the effects of political institutions and policy regimes on reducing the barriers to immigrants' economic integration. In the course of reviewing the literature, we discuss some of the methodological challenges that scholars have not fully confronted in trying to identify the causes and consequences of discrimination and violence. In doing so, we highlight that future work needs to pay greater attention to sequencing, selection, and demographic effects. Further, we suggest ways to resolve contradictory findings in regard to preferred policies aimed at advancing immigrants' economic performance.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: Predisposing Factors and Situational Triggers: Exclusionary Reactions to Immigrant Minorities
ABSTRACT: This paper examines the bases of opposition to immigrant minorities in Western Europe, focusing on The Netherlands. The specific aim of this study is to test the validity of predictions derived from two theories---realistic conflict, which emphasizes considerations of economic well-being, and social identity, which emphasizes considerations of identity based on group membership. The larger aim of this study is to investigate the interplay of predisposing factors and situational triggers in evoking political responses. The analysis is based on a series of three experiments embedded in a public opinion survey carried out in The Netherlands (n = 2007) in 1997--98. The experiments, combined with parallel individual-level measures, allow measurement of the comparative impact of both dispositionally based and situationally triggered threats to economic well-being and to national identity at work. The results show, first, that considerations of national identity dominate those of economic advantage in evoking exclusionary reactions to immigrant minorities and, second, that the effect of situational triggers is to mobilize support for exclusionary policies above and beyond the core constituency already predisposed to support them.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: Fenced Out: The Impact of Border Construction On US-Mexico Migration
ABSTRACT: This paper estimates the impact of the US-Mexico border fence on US-Mexico migration by exploiting variation in the timing and location of US government investment in fence construction. Using Mexican survey data and data I collected on fence construction, I find that construction in a municipality reduces migration by 27 percent for municipality residents and 15 percent for residents of adjacent municipalities. In addition, construction reduces migration by up to 35 percent from non-border municipalities. I also find that construction induces migrants to substitute toward alternative crossing locations, disproportionately deters low-skilled migrants, and reduces the number of undocumented Mexicans in the United States.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Deciding Where to Go: Policies, People And Perceptions Shaping Destination Preferences
ABSTRACT: There is considerable interest among European politicians and policymakers in the factors influencing the destination preferences of refugees and other migrants. Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with more than 250 Syrians, Eritreans and Nigerians, this article examines the destination preferences of those crossing the Mediterranean in 2015 and the extent to which they were aware of, and/or influenced by, policies intended to control and manage their arrival. Our findings question the extent to which deterrence policies have their intended or assumed effects. Preferred destinations are rarely identified solely, or even primarily, on the basis of migration policies devised by different governments with the explicit aim of reducing the number of arrivals. Rather they reflect the ``coming together'' of a wide range of factors, including access to protection and family reunification, the availability/accuracy of information, the overall economic environment and social networks. Moreover perceptions of migration policies may be more significant than their content as the implications are often not known or misunderstood.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: Who Voted for Brexit? A Comprehensive District-Level Analysis
ABSTRACT: On 23 June 2016, the British electorate voted to leave the European Union (EU). We analyse vote and turnout shares across 380 local authority areas in the United Kingdom. We find that exposure to the EU in terms of immigration and trade provides relatively little explanatory power for the referendum vote. Instead, we find that fundamental characteristics of the voting population were key drivers of the Vote Leave share, in particular their education profiles, their historical dependence on manufacturing employment as well as low income and high unemployment. At the much finer level of wards within cities, we find that areas with deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave. Our results indicate that a higher turnout of younger voters, who were more likely to vote Remain, would not have overturned the referendum result. We also compare our UK results to voting patterns for the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. We find similar factors driving the French vote. An out-of-sample prediction of the French vote using UK estimates performs reasonably well.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: The Impact of the Mariel Boatlift on the Miami Labor Market
ABSTRACT: Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: ""Utter Failure'' or Unity Out of Diversity? Debating and Evaluating Policies of Multiculturalism
ABSTRACT: Across immigrant-receiving democracies, ``multiculturalism'' has come under assault by political decision-makers and commentators. The academic debate, while less fiery, is also heated. We start by outlining the multiple meanings of ``multiculturalism'': a term for demographic diversity; a political philosophy of equality or justice; a set of policies to recognize and accommodate ethno-racial and religious diversity; or a public discourse recognizing and valorizing pluralism. We then review the existing empirical literature and offer some new statistical analyses to assess what we know about the harm or benefits of multicultural policies, focusing on sociopolitical outcomes. We conclude that multicultural policies appear to have some modest positive effects on sociopolitical integration for first-generation immigrants and likely little direct effect, positive or negative, on those in the second generation. On the question of majority backlash, the limited scholarship is mixed; we speculate that multiculturalism works best in places where both minorities and majority residents see it as part of a common national project. We end by considering the conditions under which this happens and whether there are distinctions between ``Anglo-settler'' and other countries.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: Politicized Places: Explaining Where and When Immigrants Provoke Local Opposition
ABSTRACT: In ethnic and racial terms, America is growing rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial threat hypotheses to today's immigrants have generated inconsistent results. This article develops the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative that focuses on how national and local conditions interact to construe immigrants as threatening. Hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants are most likely when communities undergo sudden influxes of immigrants and when salient national rhetoric reinforces the threat. Data from several sources, including twelve geocoded surveys from 1992 to 2009, provide consistent support for this approach. Time-series cross-sectional and panel data allow the analysis to exploit exogenous shifts in salient national issues such as the September 11 attacks, reducing the problem of residential self-selection and other threats to validity. The article also tests the hypothesis using new data on local anti-immigrant policies. By highlighting the interaction of local and national conditions, the politicized places hypothesis can explain both individual attitudes and local political outcomes.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Modes of Immigration Politics in Liberal Democratic States
ABSTRACT: The politics of immigration in liberal democracies exhibits strong similarities that are, contrary to the scholarly consensus, broadly expansionist and inclusive. Nevertheless, three groups of states display distinct modes of immigration politics. Divergent immigration histories mold popular attitudes toward migration and ethnic heterogeneity and affect the institutionalization of migration policy and politics. The English-speaking settler societies (the United States, Canada, and Australia) have histories of periodically open immigration, machineries of immigration planning and regulation, and densely organized webs of interest groups contesting policies. Their institutionalized politics favors expansionary policies and is relatively immune to sharp swings in direction. Many European states (France, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium) experienced mass migration only after World War II and in a form that introduced significant non-European minorities. Their immigration politics is shaped by what most see as the unfortunate consequences of those episodes and are partially institutionalized and highly volatile and conflictual. European states until recently sending countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece) deal with migration pressures for the first time in their modern histories, under crisis conditions, and in the context of intensifying coordination of policies within the European Union. We should expect the normalization of immigration politics in both sets of European states. Although they are unlikely to appropriate the policies of the English-speaking democracies, which should remain unique in their openness to mass immigration, their approach to immigration will, nevertheless, take the liberal democratic form.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes
ABSTRACT: The effect of intergroup contact has long been a question central to social scientists. As political and technological changes bring increased international migration, understanding intergroup con- tact is increasingly important to scientific and policy debates. Unfortunately, limitations in causal inference using observational data and the practical inability to experimentally manipulate demographic diversity has limited scholars' ability to address the effects of intergroup contact. Here, I report the results of a ran- domized controlled trial testing the causal effects of repeated in- tergroup contact, in which Spanish-speaking confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted, for a period of days, into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-whites living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus simulating the conditions of demographic change. The result of this experiment is a signifi- cant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects. This experiment demonstrates that even very minor demographic change causes strong exclusionary reactions. Developed nations and politically liberal subnational units are expected to experience a politically conservative shift as international migration brings increased intergroup contact.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: Why Border Enforcement Backfired
ABSTRACT: In this article the authors undertake a systematic analysis of why border enforcement backfired as a strategy of immigration control in the United States. They argue theoretically that border enforcement emerged as a policy response to a moral panic about the perceived threat of Latino immigration to the United States propounded by self-interested bureaucrats, politicians, and pundits who sought to mobilize political and material resources for their own benefit. The end result was a self-perpetuating cycle of rising enforcement and increased apprehensions that resulted in the militarization of the border in a way that was disconnected from the actual size of the undocumented flow. Using an instrumental variable approach, the authors show how border militarization affected the behavior of unauthorized migrants and border outcomes to transform undocumented Mexican migration from a circular flow of male workers going to three states into an 11 million person population of settled families living in 50 states.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: Diversity, Social Capital, and Cohesion
ABSTRACT: We review the bourgeoning literature on ethno-racial diversity and its alleged effects on public trust and cohesion in the context of the evolution of the concept of social capital and earlier claims about its manifold positive effects. We present evidence that questions such claims and points to the roots of civicness and trust in deep historical processes associated with race and immigration. We examine the claims that immigration reduces social cohesion by drawing on the sociological classics to show the forms of cohesion that actually keep modern societies together. This leads to a typology that shows ``communitarianism'' to be just one such form and one not required, and not necessarily ideal, for the smooth operation of complex organizations and institutions. Implications of our conclusions for future research and immigration policy are discussed.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: The Long-run Effect of 9/11: Terrorism, Backlash, and the Assimilation of Muslim Immigrants in the West
ABSTRACT: This article investigates whether the 9/11 attacks affected the assimilation rate of Muslims in the US. Terror attacks by Islamic groups are likely to induce a backlash against Muslims, thereby raising their costs of assimilation. We find that Muslim immigrants living in states with the sharpest increase in hate crimes also exhibit: greater chances of marrying within their own ethnic group; higher fertility; lower female labour force participation; and lower English proficiency. These findings shed light on the increasing use of terror and concurrent rise in social tensions surrounding Muslim immigrants in the West.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Economic Explanations for Opposition to Immigration: Distinguishing Between Prevalence and Conditional Impact
ABSTRACT: What explains variation in individuals' opposition to immigration? While scholars have consistently shown cultural concerns to be strong predictors of opposition, findings regarding the labor-market competition hypothesis are highly contested. To help understand these divergent results, we distinguish between the prevalence and conditional impact of determinants of immigration attitudes. Leveraging a targeted sampling strategy of high-technology counties, we conduct a study of Americans' attitudes toward H-1B visas. The plurality of these visas are occupied by Indian immigrants, who are skilled but ethnically distinct, enabling us to measure a specific skill set (high technology) that is threatened by a particular type of immigrant (H-1B visa holders). Unlike recent aggregate studies, our targeted approach reveals that the conditional impact of the relationship in the high-technology sector between economic threat and immigration attitudes is sizable. However, labor-market competition is not a prevalent source of threat and therefore is generally not detected in aggregate analyses.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: E Pluribus Unum: Diversity and Community in The Twenty-First Century. The 2006 Johan Skytte Prize Lecture
ABSTRACT: Ethnic diversity is increasing in most advanced countries, driven mostly by sharp increases in immigration. In the long run immigration and diversity are likely to have important cultural, economic, fiscal, and developmental benefits. In the short run, however, immigration and ethnic diversity tend to reduce social solidarity and social capital. New evidence from the US suggests that in ethnically diverse neighbourhoods residents of all races tend to `hunker down'. Trust (even of one's own race) is lower, altruism and community cooperation rarer, friends fewer. In the long run, however, successful immigrant societies have overcome such fragmentation by creating new, cross-cutting forms of social solidarity and more encompassing identities. Illustra- tions of becoming comfortable with diversity are drawn from the US military, religious institu- tions, and earlier waves of American immigration.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: Defying the Law of Gravity: The Political Economy of International Migration
ABSTRACT: Bilateral flows of international migrants exhibit tremendous variance both across destination countries and over time. To explain this variance, studies of international migration tend to focus on economic determinants such as income differentials or on social conditions such as the presence of coethnics in certain destination countries. The authors argue that migration is driven not solely by economic or social determinants; rather, the political environment across destinations plays a substantively large role in influencing bilateral migration flows. They test the importance of the political environment---citizenship rights and the prominence of right-wing parties---using data on migration flows from 178 origin countries into 18 destination countries over the period 1980--2006. They find, even after controlling for a variety of economic, social, policy, and international variables, that variation in political environments across time and destination plays a key role in observed patterns of international migration.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: The Politics of International Migration. How Can We ""Bring the State Back In""?
ABSTRACT: In the disciplines and subdisciplines associated with the study of politics and government, including political science, public policy, public administration, and international relations, migration is a rapidly emerging field of study. Yet compared to the other social sciences-especially sociology, history, and economics-political scientists came late to the study of migration. From the standpoint of intellectual history, it is interesting to ask why political scientists and scholars of international relations were so late to focus on the topic of international migration. This is especially surprising in a country like the United States, where immigration has had an enormous impact on politics and government.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: The Hidden American Immigration Consensus: A Conjoint Analysis of Attitudes Toward Immigrants
ABSTRACT: Many studies have examined Americans' immigration attitudes. Yet prior research frequently confounds multiple questions, including which immigrants to admit and howmany to admit. To isolate attitudes on the former question, we use a conjoint experiment that simultaneously tests the influence of nine immigrant attributes in generating support for admission. Drawing on a two-wave, population-based survey, we demonstrate that Americans view educated immigrants in highstatus jobs favorably, whereas they view those who lack plans to work, entered without authorization, are Iraqi, or do not speak English unfavorably. Strikingly, Americans' preferences vary little with their own education, partisanship, labor market position, ethnocentrism, or other attributes. Beneath partisan divisions over immigration lies a broad consensus about who should be admitted to the country. The results are consistent with norms-based and sociotropic explanations of immigration attitudes. This consensus points to limits in both theories emphasizing economic and cultural threats, and sheds new light on an ongoing policy debate.",immigration_topic,2

ABSTRACT: Historical accounts suggest that Jewish {\'e}migr{\'e}s from Nazi Germany revolutionized US science. To analyze the {\'e}migr{\'e}s' effects on chemical innovation in the United States, we compare changes in patenting by US inventors in research fields of {\'e}migr{\'e}s with fields of other German chemists. Patenting by US inventors increased by 31 percent in {\'e}migr{\'e} fields. Regressions which instrument for {\'e}migr{\'e} fields with pre-1933 fields of dismissed German chemists confirm a substantial increase in US invention. Inventor-level data indicate that {\'e}migr{\'e}s encouraged innovation by attracting new researchers to their fields, rather than by increasing the productivity of incumbent inventors.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: From Individual Attitudes Towards Migrants To Migration Policy Outcomes: Theory and Evidence
ABSTRACT: We are experiencing a wave of globalization that includes everything but labour. In this paper, we argue that this is the result of restrictive migration policies implemented by destination countries. In democratic societies individual attitudes of voters represent the foundations of policy making. To understand policy outcomes, we analyse the patterns and determinants of voters' opinions on immigration. We find that, across countries of different income levels, only a small minority of voters favour more open policies. Furthermore, our analysis supports the role played by economic channels in shaping public opinion. We next investigate how attitudes translate into policy outcomes, considering two alternative frameworks: the median voter and the interest groups model. On the one hand, the very low percentages of voters favouring immigration are, in light of the existing restrictive policies, consistent with the median voter framework. At the same time, given the extent of opposition to immigration that appears in public opinion, it is somewhat surprising in a median voter framework that immigration takes place at all. We find that interest-groups dynamics have the potential to explain this puzzle.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: The Immigrant Next Door: Exposure, Prejudice, and Altruism
ABSTRACT: We study how decades-long exposure to individuals of a given foreign descent shapes natives' attitudes and behavior toward that group. Using individualized donations data, we show that long-term exposure to a given foreign ancestry leads to more generous behavior specifically toward that group's ancestral country. Focusing on exposure to Arab Muslims to examine mechanisms, we show that long-term exposure (i) decreases explicit and implicit prejudice against Arab Muslims, (ii) reduces support for policies and political candidates hostile toward Arab Muslims, (iii) increases charitable donations to Arab countries, (iv) leads to more personal contact with Arab Muslims, and (v) increases knowledge of Arab Muslims and Islam.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: No Vacancy: The Political Geography of Immigration Control in Advanced Industrial Countries
ABSTRACT: This article examines the domestic political sources of immigration control in advanced market economy countries after World War II. Immigration control can be distinguished from the broader concept of immigration policy by its emphasis on state policies that define the permissible level of resident alien admissions. The analysis is based on the well-established fact that immigrant communities are geographically concentrated. I argue that this geographic concentration creates an uneven distribution of costs and benefits, providing a spatial context for immigration politics. In this context, net public demand for tighter immigration control increases in localities where immigrants concentrate when those areas experience higher unemployment, rapid increases in immigration, higher immigrant proportions, and more generous immigrant access to social services. Each of these conditions aggravates competition between immigrants and natives, and hence native hostility, in these communities while employer support for immigration usually diminishes. Yet national politicians may ignore changes in the demand for immigration control unless these constituencies are also able to swing a national election from one party to another. The larger and less ``safe'' the local constituencies, the greater their influence in this sense. Evidence from the United Kingdom between 1955 and 1981 is consistent with these propositions.",immigration_topic,1
"TITLE: The Social Effects of Ethnic Diversity at the Local Level: A Natural Experiment With Exogenous Residential Allocation
ABSTRACT: Relying on diversity measures computed at the apartment block level under conditions of exogenous allocation of public housing in France, this paper identifies the effects of ethnic diversity on social relationships and housing quality. Housing Survey data reveal that diversity induces social anomie. Through the channel of anomie, diversity accounts for the inability of residents to sanction others for vandalism and to act collectively to demand proper building maintenance. However, anomie also lowers opportunities for violent confrontations, which are not related to diversity.",immigration_topic,2
"TITLE: Public Attitudes Toward Immigration
ABSTRACT: Immigrant populations in many developed democracies have grown rapidly, and so too has an extensive literature on natives' attitudes toward immigration. This research has developed from two theoretical foundations, one grounded in political economy, the other in political psychology. These two literatures have developed largely in isolation from one another, yet the conclusions that emerge from each are strikingly similar. Consistently, immigration attitudes show little evidence of being strongly correlated with personal economic circumstances. Instead, research finds that immigration attitudes are shaped by sociotropic concerns about its cultural impacts--- and to a lesser extent its economic impacts---on the nation as a whole. This pattern of results has held up as scholars have increasingly turned to experimental tests, and it fits the evidence from the United States, Canada, and Western Europe. Still, more work is needed to strengthen the causal identification of sociotropic concerns and to isolate precisely how, when, and why they matter for attitude formation.",immigration_topic,3
"TITLE: The Contributions of Immigrants to American Culture
ABSTRACT: The standard account of American immigration focuses on the acculturation and assimilation of immigrants and their children to American society. This analysis typically ignores the significant contributions of immigrants to the creation of American culture through the performing arts, sciences, and other cultural pursuits. Immigrants and their children are not born with more creative talents than native-born citizens, but their selectivity and marginality may have pushed and pulled those with ability into high-risk career paths that reward creative work. The presence of large numbers of talented immigrants in Hollywood, academia, and the high-tech industries has pushed American institutions to be more meritocratic and open to innovation than they would be otherwise.",immigration_topic,4
"TITLE: Does Personal Contact With Ethnic Minorities Affect Anti-Immigrant Sentiments? Evidence From a Field Experiment
ABSTRACT: This article explores the causal effect of personal contact with ethnic minorities on majority members' views on immigration, immigrants' work ethics, and support for lower social assistance benefits to immigrants than to natives. Exogenous variation in personal contact is obtained by randomising soldiers into different rooms during the basic training period for conscripts in the Norwegian Army's North Brigade. Based on contact theory of majority--minority relations, the study spells out why the army can be regarded as an ideal contextual setting for exposure to reduce negative views on minorities. The study finds a substantive effect of contact on views on immigrants' work ethics, but small and insignificant effects on support for welfare dualism, as well as on views on whether immigration makes Norway a better place in which to live.",immigration_topic,5
"TITLE: The Substantive Effects of Descriptive Representation: Gay and Lesbian Members of Congress Are More Supportive of Gay Rights
ABSTRACT: The descriptive representation of stigmatized groups has numerous benefits both to group members and society at large. We study the extent to which LGB members of the US Congress provide increased support for LGBT rights. While LGBT substantive representation has been studied extensively, descriptive representation has been examined extensively at only the local and state levels. The absence of research at the federal level is important because federal policy is essential to expanding gay rights. We overcome issues related to the small number of openly LGBT Members of Congress and the few bills either introduced or receiving votes by examining LGB legislators over 24 years (i.e., 6,425 legislator–Congress pairs) using Human Rights Campaign scores. Using Coarsened Exact Matching, we find a substantively small but statistically significant and consistently positive effect: LGB members of Congress are more supportive of LGBT rights than other members with a similar background and from a similar district. The use of matching may provide a useful approach for scholars who are interested in studying the link between descriptive and substantive representation for other small groups.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: History and Tradition in the Trump Justices’ Church-State Jurisprudence
ABSTRACT: This article analyzes conservative Supreme Court justices’ recent use of history and tradition in First Amendment religious liberty cases. It argues that these justices have failed to articulate a persuasive rationale as to why exactly the Establishment Clause must be interpreted by reference to historical practices and understandings and that they have failed to adequately show that history supports their “no-coercion” construction of what constitutes a prohibited establishment. Concerning the Free Exercise Clause, the court’s conservatives have dismissed history by disregarding historical practices that do not conform to their approach to the text. The court’s use, misuse, and nonuse of history cannot help but give the impression that policy preferences—more than history or the actual original understanding of the First Amendment—have determined recent church-state decisions.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Plastic bag bans and fees reduce harmful bag litter on shorelines
ABSTRACT: Plastic pollution threatens marine and freshwater ecosystems and the services they provide. Although plastic bag bans and taxes are increasingly implemented worldwide, their effectiveness in reducing plastic litter remains unknown. Leveraging the patchwork of bag policies across different geographic scales in the United States and citizen science data on 45,067 shoreline cleanups, we assess the impact of these policies on plastic bag litter. We find that plastic bag policies lead to a 25 to 47% decrease in plastic bags as a share of total items collected at cleanups relative to areas without policies, with taxes possibly further reducing shoreline litter. At a time when many jurisdictions are considering bag policies, while others are preemptively prohibiting them, our study provides evidence that they mitigate shoreline plastic pollution.",other_topic,3

ABSTRACT: Already rocked by decades of political interference, corporate influence, mismanagement, and partisan efforts to undermine its authority, the expert bureaucracy, the “lifeblood” of the US administrative state, is now gasping for air. On 23 May, President Trump issued an executive order (EO)—Restoring Gold Standard Science—promising to fix these issues. Instead, the EO is poised to make them far worse: It officially empowers political appointees to override conclusions and interpretations of government scientists, threaten their professional autonomy, and undermine the scientific capacity of research and regulatory agencies.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: When the Feds Hand You a “Light Envelope”: Exploring the Impact of the Federal Budget Sequester on the Build America Bond Program
ABSTRACT: In 2009, the US federal government created the Build America Bond (BAB) program to improve access to the capital markets for state and local governments. While the federal government typically subsidizes subnational capital financing indirectly through tax exemption, the BAB program provided direct cash subsidies to governments. The Budget Control Act of 2011 implemented a sequester that reduced BAB subsidies by 5.7 to 8.7% each year since 2013. This paper estimates previous and potential future sequestration losses on all outstanding BABs as of the end of 2022. It delves into BAB use and sequestration by two issuers (governments in the state of Texas and City of Chicago). The paper concludes with a discussion of the current state of BABs as it relates to recent litigation and refinancing attempts. The loss estimates provide lessons for the provision and management of federal direct subsidies available to state and local governments.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: Skill Depreciation during Unemployment: Evidence from Panel Data †
ABSTRACT: We examine the depreciation of skills among unemployed German workers using a panel of skill measures linked to administrative data. Both the reemployment hazard and reemployment earnings steadily decline with unemployment duration. Indicators of depression and loneliness also rise substantially. However, we find no decline in a wide range of cognitive and noncognitive skills while workers remain unemployed. We find the same pattern in a panel of American workers. The results imply that skill depreciation in general human capital is unlikely to be a major explanation for observed duration dependence in reemployment outcomes.

"TITLE: Noisy Politics, Quiet Technocrats: Strategic Silence by Central Banks
ABSTRACT: In contrast to the “quiet” politics of the pre‐2008 period, macroeconomic policy has become “noisy”. This break raises a question: How do independent agencies designed for quiet politics react when a contentious public turns the volume up on them? Central banks provide an interesting case because while they are self‐professed adherents to communicative transparency, individual case studies have documented their use of strategic silence as a defense mechanism against politicization. This paper provides a quantitative test of the theory that when faced with public contention on core monetary policy issues, central banks are likely to opt for strategic silence. We focus on the most contested of central bank policies: large‐scale asset purchase programs or “quantitative easing” (QE). We examine four topics associated with particularly contested side effects of QE: house prices, exchange rates, corporate debt, and climate change. We hypothesize that an active QE program makes a central bank less likely to address these topics in public. We further expect that the strength—and, in the case of the exchange rate, the direction—of this effect varies depending on the precise composition of asset purchases and on countries' growth models. Using panel regression analysis on a dataset of more than 11,000 speeches by 18 central banks, we find that as a group, central banks conducting QE programs exhibited strategic silence on house prices, exchange rates, and climate change. We also find support for three out of four country‐specific hypotheses. These results point to significant technocratic agency in the de‐ and re‐politicization of policy issues.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Affective polarization and democratic erosion: evidence from a context of weak partisanship
ABSTRACT: Can the “us versus them” dynamic in politics undermine support for democracy even in the absence of strong party identification? While much is known about affective polarization in the USA, its impact on democratic commitment in other contexts remains understudied. We examine Chile’s 2022 plebiscite, where voters decided whether to approve or reject a new constitution amid low levels of party trust and identification. Through an experiment using an unobtrusive primer, we successfully induced short-term affective polarization, heightening animosity across multiple dimensions. Our findings show that individuals primed to this polarization significantly reduced their support for democracy, mirroring patterns observed in the USA. These results emphasize the importance of studying affective polarization, especially in regions with fragile democratic histories.",other_topic,3
"TITLE: Is There a Mobility Effect? On Methodological Issues in the Mobility Contrast Model
ABSTRACT: Social mobility scholars have long been interested in estimating the effect of intergenerational mobility, typically measured by differences in the socioeconomic status between parents and offspring, on later-life outcomes of offspring. In a 2022 article “Heterogeneous Effects of Intergenerational Social Mobility: An Improved Method and New Evidence,” Luo proposes a new approach called the mobility contrast model (MCM) to define and estimate mobility effects. We argue that the MCM is inherently flawed due to its reliance on the coding scheme used for the categorical variables of social origin and destination. Specifically, when different coding schemes are applied, the estimands defined in the MCM bear distinct meanings, involve different but equally arbitrary constraints, and sometimes yield contradictory results. Moreover, regardless of the coding scheme, these estimands do not adequately capture the sociological concept of a mobility effect. To illustrate this, we reanalyze the Occupational Changes in a Generation Study data used in Luo’s study, highlighting the inconsistency of results when dummy coding versus effect coding schemes are used.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Is War in Decline?
ABSTRACT: The claim that war is in decline has gained considerable traction among analysts and policy makers. This review surveys the empirical data as well as the theoretical arguments for a decline of war. It concludes that, while great power wars have declined since 1945, war in general is not necessarily in decline. Critiques of the claim that war is in decline range from the statistical to the anthropological. While war is not necessarily in decline, though, it has changed. Specifically, a major driver of the putative decline of war—international norms, laws, and institutions—has done more to change how war is discussed and presented than whether it is prosecuted. Stronger theories of change are needed in international relations to understand whether these somewhat superficial changes could deepen in ways that produce a true decline in war.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: Donald J. Trump, the Supreme Court, and American Constitutionalism
ABSTRACT: The articles in this volume, written by leading law professors, political scientists, and journalists, center on the impact of President Donald Trump on the U.S. Supreme Court and the impact of the court on the second Trump administration and on all Americans. President Trump has already appointed a third of the current court and may appoint more than half. Considering that the second Trump administration has sought to “flood the zone” with executive actions during its first 100 days, the court’s rulings have become massively significant for American governance and for the lives of people in our nation and around the world. The four sections of the volume consider the rise of the “Trump court,” the court’s recent rulings on judicial and executive power and on a range of basic rights, its standing in the public’s eyes, and how it stacks up against high courts in other democracies.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: AI as Governance
ABSTRACT: Political scientists have had remarkably little to say about artificial intelligence (AI), perhaps because they are dissuaded by its technical complexity and by current debates about whether AI might emulate, outstrip, or replace individual human intelligence. They ought to consider AI in terms of its relationship with governance. Existing large-scale systems of governance such as markets, bureaucracy, and democracy make complex human relations tractable, albeit with some loss of information. AI's major political consequences can be considered under two headings. First, we may treat AI as a technology of governance, asking how AI's capacities to classify information at scale affect markets, bureaucracy, and democracy. Second, we might treat AI as an emerging form of governance in its own right, with its own particular mechanisms of representation and coordination. These two perspectives reveal new questions for political scientists, encouraging them to reconsider the boundaries of their discipline.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Geographic Variation in Multigenerational Mobility
ABSTRACT: Using complete-count register data spanning three generations, we document spatial patterns in inter- and multi-generational mobility in Sweden. Across municipalities, grandfather–child correlations in education or earnings tend to be larger than the square of the parent–child correlations, suggesting that the latter understate status transmission in the long run. Yet, conventional parent–child correlations capture regional differences in long-run transmission and therefore remain useful for comparative purposes. We further find that the within-country association between mobility and income inequality (the “Great Gatsby Curve”) is at least as strong in the multi- as in the inter-generational case. Interpreting those patterns through the lens of a latent factor model, we find that regional differences in mobility primarily reflect variation in the transmission of latent advantages, rather than in how those advantages translate into observed outcomes.",other_topic,3
"TITLE: Republicans are flagged more often than Democrats for sharing misinformation on X’s Community Notes
ABSTRACT: We use crowd-sourced assessments from X’s Community Notes program to examine whether there are partisan differences in the sharing of misleading information. Unlike previous studies, misleadingness here is determined by agreement across a diverse community of platform users, rather than by fact-checkers. We find that 2.3 times more posts by Republicans are flagged as misleading compared to posts by Democrats. These results are not base rate artifacts, as we find no meaningful overrepresentation of Republicans among X users. Our findings provide strong evidence of a partisan asymmetry in misinformation sharing which cannot be attributed to political bias on the part of raters, and indicate that Republicans will be sanctioned more than Democrats even if platforms transition from professional fact-checking to Community Notes.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Doing the Lord’s Work: Deconstructing Fundamentalist Christianity Through Cathartic Anti-Fandom on Reddit
ABSTRACT: r/fundiesnarkuncensored is a Reddit community that monitors and critiques fundamentalist Christian, namely evangelical, content creators. Many members of the community were formerly conservative Christians who have since deconstructed some or all of their beliefs. This study approaches “fundie snarkers,” particularly those who have deconstructed, through the lenses of anti-fandom and affect theory, to deepen our understanding of anti-fandom as a simultaneously ideological and affective phenomenon. Through individual, semi-structured interviews with 20 members of r/fundiesnarkuncensored, we explore the role that “fundie snarking” plays in members’ deconstruction journeys and vice versa. Participants organized content on the subreddit into three categories based on their affective and intellectual responses to that content: petty snark, or superficial critiques that participants find both guiltily pleasurable and frustratingly rude; structural snark, or systemic critiques of fundamentalism that participants universally esteem; and dark snark, or content that participants find too distressing to engage. Taken together, this “structure of snark” reveals the ambiguity of their anti-fandom by emphasizing that participants have empathy for the fundies they criticize and see the subreddit’s ideal purpose as a tool for deconstruction. Ultimately, through our discussion of the gratifications participants obtain through their engagement with the subreddit, we propose an additional form of anti-fandom: cathartic anti-fandom. Cathartic anti-fandom involves the dislike and critique of ideologies, practices, and communities in which the anti-fan formerly participated and/or by which they were harmed. By filtering fundamentalist Christian teaching through critical commentary and making these ideologies laughable, r/fundiesnarkuncensored provides an accessible and enjoyable space for members to unlearn harmful ideologies.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: Democracies Not in Peril: Globalization and Tax Revenue
ABSTRACT: In a recent book, Bastiaens and Rudra (2018) claim that as governments embraced trade liberalization in the 1990’s, they experienced a revenue shock, and that democratic governments found it harder to repair the breach than did authoritarian ones. As a result, they argue, contemporary trade liberalizations have posed a danger to democracy by starving it for funds, forcing vulnerable governments to resort to politically unpopular policies. This is an important and provocative argument. However, good evidence contradicts its major premise. This research note critiques some data, presentation, and conceptual problems with the argument. It provides new analyses using the well-curated dataset from the International Centre for Tax and Development (ICTD, updated by UNU-WIDER), instead of the authors’ primary data from World Development Indicators . It shows that developing countries–and democracies especially–did not, in fact, suffer a revenue shock. On average, trade taxes constituted only a minor part of their government revenue. While the revenue they provided declined slightly over the period in question, this trend was overwhelmed by variation in other tax and non-tax revenues. As for total tax revenues, a key variable sometimes underemphasized in the book, ICTD data show that they expanded more rapidly in democratic developing countries than in non-democratic ones. Regression analyses with ICTD data also fail to confirm the authors’ finding of a revenue shortfall among developing democracies.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: Stuck in the waiting room: citizen experiences of administrative limbo in three European crises
ABSTRACT: In recent years, there have been numerous cases where citizens have found themselves stuck in highly protracted administrative processes affecting outcomes vital to their lives and livelihoods. However, systematic inquiries into the experience of being trapped by bureaucratic procedures or state inaction for sometimes multiple years are still lacking. To study the interactions between citizens and the state when long waiting times and significant outcomes are involved, we introduce the concept of administrative limbo. We examine administrative limbo using primary and secondary interview data from the Irish defective concrete block crisis, the Dutch childcare benefits affair, and the Dutch Groningen gas crisis. Findings suggest that experiences of administrative limbo are marked by prolonged and extensive uncertainty, accumulating strain, and negatively impacted life perspectives. We find that the effects of being stuck in administrative limbo are profound, indicating that temporal experiences of inaction and action should be further explored in public administration.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Negotiating for Autonomy: How Humanitarian INGOs Resisted Donors During the Syrian Refugee Response
ABSTRACT: More autonomous humanitarian international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs) have greater capacity to determine who receives aid among conflict- and crisis-affected populations than their donor-following counterparts. The latter are more likely to become instruments of states seeking geostrategic influence in places like Syria and Ukraine. Drawing on more than 120 interviews with INGO and donor agency workers, 10 months of political ethnography among INGOs working with refugees in Lebanon and Jordan after the war in Syria, and content analysis of organizational documents, this article investigates the ways that INGOs secure autonomy from donors. In a theory-building exercise, it introduces the concept of negotiation experience to explain why some INGOs develop skills and strategies that allow them to resist donor demands. It also identifies some of the tactics used by experienced negotiators to do so. The findings have implications for who controls and is accountable for humanitarian policy and practice, as well as the abilities of state donors to influence humanitarian behavior. They call into question expectations that INGOs “scramble” for funds under conditions of funding scarcity.",other_topic,3
"TITLE: How public benefits make citizens in Latino mixed-status families: self-efficacy, institutional engagement, and concerted citizenship cultivation
ABSTRACT: Experiences with public benefits can shape recipients’ feelings (belonging) and enactment of citizenship (e.g., political, civic, or economic behaviors). However, we know less about how undocumented and lawful permanent resident (LPR) immigrants fit within this paradigm. This study, based on in-depth interviews with forty working-poor undocumented and LPR Latina immigrant mothers, reveals striking ways in which mothers described the meanings they attached to the benefits received and the social processes their experiences with benefit programs informed. Many mothers described an increased sense of self-efficacy as mothers and as immigrants, expanded notions of government responsiveness, and shifts in how they understood the citizenship (broadly conceived) of their children based on their experiences with benefits. This was even reported among mothers who used programs often seen as stigmatizing or who had challenges arise in petitioning for benefits. Moreover, mothers conveyed these meanings spurring legal, economic, and civic behavioral adaptations in their lives, deepening their engagement as citizens. They also described how the meanings derived from benefits use produced changes in their parenting practices, describing structuring their children’s time and engagement with institutions, as well as fostering reasoning skills and attitudes meant to benefit their children’s long-term integration. I term such practices concerted citizenship cultivation. For children with legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing comfort and entitlement within US institutions, socializing interactions with authority figures, and promoting expanded engagement in society. For children who lacked legal citizenship, concerted citizenship cultivation focused on developing positive identity and deepening engagement within protective institutions.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Unraveling human crowd dynamics through the foot tracking of pedestrians
ABSTRACT: Movement of pedestrian crowds is ubiquitous in human society. However, it is unclear what dynamical regimes pedestrian crowds can exhibit at different crowd densities, how pedestrians move in these different dynamical regimes, and in which dynamical regime the movement synchronization of pedestrians is most likely to occur. Here, we conducted a unidirectional crowd movement experiment, in which we tracked the movement of pedestrian crowds through foot tracking. We find experimentally that pedestrian crowds can exhibit three distinct dynamical regimes (free regime, slow-moving regime, and jammed regime) depending on the crowd density. In the free regime, pedestrians’ movement is not constrained; in the slow-moving regime, pedestrians’ speed is constrained, but pedestrians’ movement direction in each step is not influenced; and in the jammed regime, both pedestrians’ speed and movement direction in each step are constrained. We also demonstrate that pedestrians are most likely to synchronize their movements spontaneously at the onset of jamming. Our findings provide important insights into crowd dynamics.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: The Political Legacy of Elite Repression
ABSTRACT: Most work on the legacies of violence studies mass repression. In this paper, we explore the longterm effects of selective repression of local elites on ordinary community members who had not been subject to direct repression. Drawing on the literature on the legacy of violence against civilians, we hypothesize that elite-targeted repression creates a political backlash in the affected communities. Examining the legacy of Nazi-era repression of Catholic clergy in Bavaria we ask whether historical repression against Catholic priests is associated with higher support for Christian Democrats after WWII. We find that municipalities where Catholic priests had been repressed are more likely to vote for Christian Democrats in the post-war elections. The legacy of priest repression on voting behavior persists into the present, although its magnitude wanes overtime. These findings suggest that repression of elites leaves lasting intergenerational legacies on mass political and social behavior.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: Has the Roberts Court Helped Donald Trump and the GOP Rig Elections and Erode American Democracy?
ABSTRACT: Over the past half century, Republican leaders have had considerable success enlisting courts in their campaign to boost the party’s electoral prospects through the suppression of voting and the manipulation of election rules. Donald Trump has embraced this mission and escalated the assault on America’s electoral processes in new and dangerous ways. Has the Supreme Court supported or opposed this contemptible project? Its recent election law decisions offer a mixed verdict, though its performance mostly leans in an antidemocratic direction. The court’s decisions safeguarding democracy are fewer than those that undermine voting rights and elections, are typically handed down over the objections of Trump’s appointees, and often include doctrinal provisions that enable it to restrict democratic participation in the future. Whether the Supreme Court will abet or discourage the erosion of American democracy in the future is an open question.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: The Social Origins of Democracy and Authoritarianism Reconsidered: Prussia and Sweden in Comparison
ABSTRACT: In a large social science literature, unequal rural class structures (“landlordism”) are associated with authoritarian political outcomes. This paper revisits the debate, focus- ing on the landlords’ ideological domination of the lower classes and anti-democratic attitudes in estate-dominated areas. We contrast the authoritarian landlordism model with a perspective where inequality fosters leftist mobilization if landlords fail to assert hegemony. Analyzing Prussia and Sweden–often seen as opposites in terms of their ru- ral class structures–we challenge the view of Sweden as egalitarian, showing its agrarian inequality was similar to Prussia’s. Examining within-country correlations between land inequality and electoral support for Conservatives, Nazis, and voter turnout, we find no evidence supporting the authoritarian landlordism model. Instead, our results empha- size the role of popular mobilization in Sweden and landlords’ weakening influence in Prussia.",other_topic,3
"TITLE: Information Systems, Service Delivery, and Corruption: Evidence From the Bangladesh Civil Service
ABSTRACT: Slow public service delivery and corruption are common problems in low- and middle-income countries. Can better management information systems improve delivery speed? Does improving the delivery speed reduce corruption? In a large-scale experiment with the Bangladesh Civil Service, I send monthly scorecards measuring delays in service delivery to government officials and their supervisors. The scorecards increase on-time service delivery by 11 percent but do not reduce bribes. Instead, the scorecards increase bribes for high-performing bureaucrats. A model where bureaucrats' reputational concerns constrain bribes can explain the results. When positive performance feedback improves bureaucrats' reputations, the constraint is relaxed, and bribes increase. (JEL D73, D83, H83, O17)",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Emerging Adults’ Relational Turbulence with Parents as a Function of Parent Involvement in Their Romantic Relationship: A Conditional Process Analysis
ABSTRACT: Using relational turbulence theory, this study examined the conditional direct and indirect associations between parent involvement (i.e., facilitation and interference) in emerging adults’ romantic relationships and relational turbulence in the parent-child relationship vis-à-vis the valence of conversations with parents about the romantic partner. Participants included 264 emerging adult children who were involved in a romantic relationship. Parent interference with the romantic partnership was directly and indirectly associated with turbulence in the parent-child relationship via communication valence. The direct association was conditioned by the family’s conversation orientation and whether the adult child valued the parent’s opinion about their romantic partnership, whereas the indirect association was not. Likewise, parent facilitation was directly and indirectly associated with turbulence via communication valence, though again only the direct association was conditioned by conversation orientation and valuing the parent’s opinion. Implications for relational turbulence theory are discussed.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: Political Meritocracy and Democracy
ABSTRACT: Political meritocracy is the idea that political institutions should aim to empower those people who are particularly well-suited to rule. This article surveys recent literature in democratic theory that argues on behalf of institutional arrangements that aim to realize the ideal of political meritocracy. We detail two prominent families of meritocratic proposals: nondemocratic meritocracy and weighted voting. We then describe and briefly evaluate five potentially important criticisms of political meritocracy related to the coherence of merit as an ideal, the demographic objection, rent-seeking, political inequality, and social peace. We also consider the key ways in which existing electoral democracies create spaces for institutionally meritocratic forms. Finally, we highlight the importance of exploring institutional innovations that allow democracies to effectively incorporate expertise without, at the same time, becoming vulnerable to the criticisms of political meritocracy that we discuss.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: Bespoke science: the use of ad hoc scientific advisory committees in the Covid-19 pandemic
ABSTRACT: Many governments formed ad hoc scientific advisory committees in the Covid-19 pandemic because they offered the government greater control over policy advice than standing agencies. The difference between ad hoc and standing advisory bodies has been little noted in the literature. High-uncertainty crises demanding expertise and requiring action from the national government increase the value of policy discretion, raising the value of controlling the scientific narrative. An ad hoc body is generally easier to control than a standing body because policymakers have greater liberty to choose its members, specify its mandate, and disband and reconstitute it when needed. Control generally requires either a narrow membership or a narrow mandate. If members cannot be chosen to be reliably aligned with the government or its policy preferences, a narrow mandate will restrain the committee from offering undesired advice or analysis. Our argument builds on the public choice assumption of motivational symmetry: The choices of scientists and politicians are shaped by the same motives and desires that influence individuals in any other sphere of life. Our case studies of Italy, UK, US, Poland, Uganda, and Sweden support our theory.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Aspirational Politics of Talent Acquisition: Entrepreneurial Limits and Indian Short Video Platforms
ABSTRACT: Local short video platforms in India such as Moj and Josh have encountered mixed success in wooing talented creators and new users to their platforms. Some of the challenges they have faced suggest the limits of aspirational politics which is entangled with aspects of authenticity and relatability as well as the political economy of start-up apps and platform capitalisms. I endeavor to understand TikTok’s success in India and also comprehend in what ways Indian short video platforms tried to replicate TikTok’s algorithmic logics and creator/talent acquisition strategies within the cultural context of vernacular creativity in India. The article connects discussions of the popularity of short video platforms with recruitment strategies to tap influential content creators in provincial India. The article contends that while theorizing aspirational politics, it is not enough to study (in isolation) how creators aspire to be more successful and gain more followers and influence. Aspirations are also actively fashioned and nurtured by the platform’s talent scouts, content directors, and studio heads. The Indian government along with corporations also creates aspirational discourses. I conceptualize aspirational politics and entrepreneurial limits in these slippages and ruptures across individual desires and state-corporate-platform discourses of aspiration and entrepreneurship.",other_topic,3

ABSTRACT: Political distortions are prevalent in many developing countries, implying substantial productivity losses. This paper investigates the impact of trade liberalization on political distortions in India. First, using variation in political turnover, we identify that politicians distort resources in favor of politically connected firms. Second, we show that reduced tariffs on input goods significantly decrease the distortionary effect of political connections, as trade reduces firms' dependence on politicians for sourcing inputs. The results suggest a new margin for gains from trade through reduced politically driven misallocation, implying that trade can address a widespread source of productivity losses.

"TITLE: The Broader Political Significance of Houses of Worship: Theory and Evidence from Indonesian Mosques
ABSTRACT: Houses of worship hold specific political significance because they shape the political attitudes and behaviors of their congregations. I argue that they also have broader political significance because their impact extends beyond the congregation to the local community. I support this argument by analyzing the locations of more than 300,000 mosques in Indonesia and national panel data of more than 16,000 Muslim respondents. Employing a difference-in-difference approach, I find that the presence of new mosques in a kecamatan (district) correlates with increased exclusionary attitudes toward non-Muslims. To a more limited extent, the presence of more mosques also correlates with a greater emphasis on religious similarity in voting decisions. Further exploratory analysis suggests that mosques serving as channels for information and communication within the community plays a more significant role in producing these effects than their functions in enhancing religiosity or reinforcing religious identity.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: When Does Employee Turnover Matter? Analyzing the Role of Organizational Memory in the Federal IT Workforce
ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a theory of organizational memory predicting that task knowledge retained in organizational structures (i.e., agency centralization and task standardization) buffers the disruptive effects of employee turnover. Using a dataset of information technology (IT) projects implemented by 94 U.S. federal agencies between FY2015-FY2021, estimates from fractional panel probit models reveal that both centralized authority under chief information officers and task standardization reduce project delays associated with IT workforce turnover; they are particularly effective in mitigating knowledge loss from voluntary and managerial position turnover. This evidence highlights the contingent nature of the turnover–performance relationship, suggesting that government agencies with high turnover may experience fewer delays when organizational structures retain task knowledge.",other_topic,1
"TITLE: Can followers detect political leaders who cheat? Testing an evolutionary position
ABSTRACT: Researchers applying evolutionary theory to political psychology discover that in democracies, most citizens struggle to select political leaders based on their ideologies. Rather, they tend to concentrate on procedural fairness during public decision-making when evaluating their leaders. We re-examine such evolutionary propositions in China using eight Wason selection experiments. In autocracies, where accountability systems are weak or absent, little is known about how citizens judge politicians’ ideologies and their cheating behaviors. Our findings show that Chinese citizens are incapable of identifying political leaders’ ideological orientations; instead, they rely on a cheater-detection mechanism, evaluating leaders based on their adherence to procedural fairness. These results contribute to our understanding of democratic competence and the cognitive mechanisms of political judgment in autocratic contexts.",other_topic,2

ABSTRACT: As the Trump administration systematically defunds the American research ecosystem, while disingenuously promising a return to so-called “gold standard science,” hope can be drawn from the new bipartisan initiative from Senators Martin Heinrich (Democrat, New Mexico) and Michael Rounds (Republican, South Dakota). Their American Science Acceleration Project (ASAP) seeks to make science in the United States “ten times faster by 2030” through five pillars: data, computing, artificial intelligence (AI), collaboration, and process improvement. But simply accelerating will exacerbate historical weaknesses in our innovation system and reproduce the damaging Silicon Valley ethos of “move fast and break things.” Faster is not necessarily better when it comes to innovation and discovery.

"TITLE: Moral Reframing and Transgender Athlete Bans: In-groups, Out-groups, and a Future Research Agenda
ABSTRACT: Scholars have long touted the power of moral convictions in shaping political attitudes. Moral reframing involves designing messages that align with an opponent’s moral convictions with the goal of increasing their willingness to adopt that position. Using lessons from the literature on political psychology, we examine the rhetoric used by legislators supporting and opposing transgender athlete bans in US states to determine how moral reframing was used. We find that the moral convictions of both sides, coupled with their emphasis on in-groups and out-groups, lead legislators to interpret the fundamental principles of the bills differently. This dynamic renders it challenging to reframe moral arguments in a manner that might sway opponents. Additional research is needed to study the efficacy of moral reframing in legislative debates on transgender-related policies.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Opposing Backsliding Through Policy Competition: The Case of Poland’s Civic Platform (2015–2023)
ABSTRACT: Democratic backsliding is often accompanied by popular policy innovations which boost the incumbent’s popularity, leaving opposition parties in a difficult electoral position. We analyze the strategies available to the opposition in such contexts through a theoretical discussion of issue-based competition and an exploratory case study of Poland’s main opposition party Civic Platform (PO) during eight years of democratic backsliding under United Right governments. Studying the changing positions of PO in three policy areas (abortion, social policy and national memory and identity), we outline how the opposition can re-position itself to attract votes. We argue that backsliding, because it produces a sense of urgency, incentivizes opposition parties to shift some of their policy positions either towards or away from the incumbent’s – even on issues that are central to their political identity. Because backsliding unleashes an existential conflict that strengthens partisan loyalties, opposition voters tolerate some changes that go against their preferences.",other_topic,5
"TITLE: Salary History and Employer Demand: Evidence from a Two-Sided Audit
ABSTRACT: We study how salary disclosures affect employer demand using a field experiment featuring hundreds of recruiters evaluating over 2,000 job applications. We randomize the presence of salary questions and the candidates' disclosures for male and female applicants. Our findings suggest that extra dollars disclosed yield higher salary offers, willingness to pay, and perceptions of outside options by recruiters (all similarly for men and women). Recruiters make negative inferences about the quality and bargaining positions of nondisclosing candidates, though they penalize silent women less. (JEL C93, D82, J22, J23, J31)",other_topic,1
"TITLE: Softblocking: Disconnective Practices, Imagined Affordances, and Reciprocity on Twitter
ABSTRACT: This study investigates the social meaning of softblocking, a practice on social media in which a user blocks and then immediately unblocks another user, causing a mutual unfollowing. This study finds that softblocking highlights that social media users exercise agency in creating imagined affordances through novel use of pre-installed features to do social work. It also discusses what the rise of softblocking suggests about the demand for reciprocity within social media interaction. With a corpus of 96,541 tweets mentioning softblocking from 2009 to 2020 and corpus-assisted discourse analysis, this study explores (1) how softblocking is differentiated from pre-packaged affordances, (2) how softblocking is negotiated metadiscursively, and (3) how expectations of reciprocity are addressed by softblocking. I find that users expect sustained interaction and value-sharing with those they are in mutual following relationships with and also expect these relationships to be broken reciprocally. This study argues that softblocking meets the demand for disconnective action in a mutual manner, in line with emerging norms of politeness on social media that see reciprocity as politeness.",other_topic,2
"TITLE: Bridging the divide: Why the science-policy interface matters for global food systems
ABSTRACT: For decades, empirical evidence has pointed to the unsustainable trajectory of global food systems, linking industrialized production to soil degradation , water stress , and nutrition deficits across vulnerable populations and underscoring the urgent need for science-based policy interventions. But despite robust, peer‐reviewed evidence outlining both the magnitude of food‐system threats and an extensive array of potential science-backed interventions, structural obstacles such as institutional inertia, competing policy agendas, and chronic resource constraints have consistently prevented the uptake of scientific recommendations into effective policy frameworks.",other_topic,3
"TITLE: Making Fusionism Great Again: Authoritarian Means to Christian Nationalist Ends
ABSTRACT: Donald Trump and Trumpism have transformed the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society, two institutions at the heart of the conservative legal movement. In this article, I use the conservative philosophy of fusionism as a lens for understanding the causes and consequences of the transformation. The original fusionism of William F. Buckley and Frank S. Meyer brought disparate factions of conservatives together under the mantle of libertarian means to conservative ends. Here, I show that Trump and Trumpism have transmogrified that original concept into a “new fusionism” of authoritarian means to Christian nationalist ends . I investigate the extent to which this “new fusionism” has been embraced or endorsed by the Heritage Foundation and the Federalist Society and what the consequences might be for the respectability and efficacy of the conservative legal movement after Trump.",other_topic,4
"TITLE: Decentralization, Europeanization, State Restructuring, and the Politics of Instruments Accumulation: The Case of the French Housing Sector
ABSTRACT: This paper advances research on policy accumulation by analyzing its political consequences in the French housing sector. It argues that, in the context of decentralization reforms, the accumulation of policy instruments has undermined national steering capacities and intensified territorial inequalities. Decentralization accelerated accumulation by decoupling policy formulation from the costs and administrative responsibilities of implementation, shifting these burdens onto subnational governments. The resulting proliferation of instruments politicized implementation, as local authorities confronted capacity‐driven trade‐offs between adhering to national directives and pursuing local policies, while simultaneously gaining opportunities to innovate and build coalitions with non‐state actors. Consequenty, local governments in economically dynamic areas could strategically leverage policy accumulation to advance their interests, whereas those in less affluent regions faced administrative overload. By adopting an institutional perspective on policy instruments, this paper shows how accumulation research can foreground the political consequences of accumulation, which increasingly shape the problem‐solving capacities and legitimacy of modern states.",other_topic,5
