[{"title": "Electoral responses to economic crises", "authors": "Yotam Margalit, Omer Solodoch", "abstract": "How do voters respond to economic crises: Do they turn against the incumbent, reward a certain political camp, polarize to the extremes, or perhaps continue to vote much like before? Analyzing extensive data on electorates, parties, and individuals in 24 countries for over half a century, we document a systematic pattern whereby economic crises tend to disproportionately favor the right. Three main forces underlie this pattern. First, voters tend to decrease support for the party heading the government when the crisis erupts. Second, after crises, voters tend to assign greater importance to issues typically owned by the right. Third, when center‐right parties preside over a crisis, voters often drift further rightward to nationalist parties rather than defect to the left. The far‐right thus serves as an effective vehicle for keeping the center‐right in power even when facing postcrisis disaffection by its voters.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70008", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70008", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0070896773491018195}, {"title": "Testing the stability and temporal order of People of Color Identity and People of Color Solidarity : New evidence from a survey panel of Asian, Black, Latino, and multiracial adults", "authors": "Andrew M.

Using data on dozens of agencies over twenty-four years, I find that agencies form policy-making coalitions when it helps them activate veto points and exploit collective action problems among their overseers in Congress: namely, committee freeriding in oversight and legislative gridlock in lawmaking.

Specifically, it examines how religious affiliation and the religious composition of an area influence concerns about farmer–herder conflicts. Regression analysis reveals no significant difference in concern between individuals living in predominantly Muslim versus Christian areas. However, religious affiliation plays a crucial role, with Muslims generally expressing less concern about these conflicts than their Christian counterparts. Disaggregating the data by survey year, a shifting pattern emerges: In 2017, individuals in predominantly Muslim areas were less concerned about farmer–herder conflicts than those in Christian areas, but by 2020, this trend had reversed. This shift may be linked to the rise in banditry involving nomadic pastoralists in Nigeria’s predominantly Muslim Northwest region. Notably, in 2020, Muslims and Christians exhibited no significant differences in their level of concern.

Conversely, if countries have fewer resources to devote to interfering in the religious realm—a situation naturally characteristic of poorer countries—they experience less religious conflict. Thus, poor countries do not necessarily experience higher rates of religious conflict than wealthy countries.

This article introduces and advances the concept of the joint production of election violence – a relatively common but undertheorized process through which political elites rely, not on their own militias or state security forces, but on the collaboration and participation of ordinary citizens. Such violence is especially puzzling in democracies, where citizens ostensibly have nonviolent avenues for political claim-making. To help explain how such violence becomes possible and how it unfolds, the article develops a framework that emphasizes two central components: (1) the circulation and resonance of threat-based and victimhood narratives that legitimize political violence, and (2) the social infrastructure – networks and organizational linkages – that facilitate the organization and coordination of violence. We draw on two cases of jointly produced election violence – Nigeria in 2003 and the United States in 2021 – to demonstrate how the framework can be applied across democracies at distinct stages of consolidation.

This article develops a theory centred around variation in electoral violence perpetrators. Focusing on the subnational level, I argue that variation in rents helps explain why some incumbents recruit armed groups while others rely on ordinary citizens. Incumbents with access to large rents can afford to hire costly yet effective armed groups.

I use over one hundred interviews conducted with politicians, journalists, voters, civil society members and citizens in four Nigerian states, Lagos, Rivers, Plateau and Nasarawa, to probe the plausibility of the argument. I triangulate interview findings with newspapers and observer reports. Findings show that in Lagos and Rivers, incumbents hire and maintain armed groups such as transport workers and cult groups due to high rents, while those in the low-rents state of Nasarawa hire citizens to perpetrate violence.

In this context, we hypothesize that political violence during election periods decreases support for political elites who propagate or condone such actions. To test this hypothesis, we examine the impact of the Capitol insurrection on support for the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States. Specifically, we analyze tweets posted by members of the US Congress around the time of the insurrection and use social media engagement as an indicator of public support for both parties. Employing a series of short-run difference-in-differences models, we find that the Capitol attack reduced engagement with messages posted by Republican politicians compared to Democrats. This effect is especially pronounced for Republican politicians closely aligned with Donald Trump, who is widely seen as having incited the attack. Importantly, our findings are not driven by the general negativity of Republican tweets or their explicit attacks on the Democratic Party, both of which could plausibly have heightened tensions. Instead, the evidence supports a ‘blame attribution’ mechanism, wherein the public punishes politicians responsible for instigating violence or condoning those who do.

Regression analysis of lower and upper chamber state legislative maps shows that more populous districts lead to more partisan bias in maps even after accounting for other aspects of districts and Voting Rights Act requirements that affect how states draw district lines.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.70031", "doi": "10.1111/lsq.70031", "journal_full": "Legislative Studies Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005174294613091268}, {"title": "Book review: This is only the beginning.

Therefore, armed groups that later become distinguishable as “rebels” or “bandits” often initially use this similar repertoire of violence. The resulting ambiguity of this violence—for outsiders from states to scholars—presents an opportunity for aspiring rebels, since states struggle to discern the threat they pose.

The SIR model captures influence dynamics via a pair of $n \\times n$ matrices that quantify how the actions of one actor affect the future actions of another. This framework not only provides a statistical mechanism for explaining actor influence based on observable traits but also improves computational efficiency through an iterative block coordinate descent method.

However, the polarized opinions visible on the media may not necessarily indicate deeper fragmentation of hidden beliefs, which is often assumed to be driven by persuasion. Instead, public opinion polarization can emerge from contextual dynamics that decouple private attitudes from expressed opinions. This study explores these conditions through an agent-based model (ABM) that integrates the dynamics of attitude formation with the ‘spiral of silence’ theory. The simulations reveal that opinions can polarize or converge due to subtle contextual changes—such as changes in social connectivity or elite influence—even when the degree of attitude polarization remains moderate. Furthermore, the findings show that increased social connectivity attenuates the polarization of both attitudes and opinions, as greater exposure to diverse perspectives mitigates the effects of repulsion toward opposing views. These findings highlight how public opinions may fail to reliably reflect the true sentiments of the population, creating a misleading impression of a more fractured society while suggesting that increased connectivity could help mitigate such divisions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00936502251362278", "doi": "10.1177/00936502251362278", "journal_full": "Communication Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008891188875035594}, {"title": "The State of Evidence in Digital Hate Research: An Umbrella Review", "authors": "Jörg Matthes, Kevin Koban, Stephanie Bührer, Thomas Kirchmair, Phelia Weiss, Maryam Khaleghipour, Melanie Saumer, Rinat Meerson", "abstract": "Digital hate poses a threat to citizens, communities, and societies.

Geoeconomics is primarily concerned with the use of “economic weapons” of coercion, while the conflict literature mainly focuses on military weapons and war. We propose bridging these two approaches, focusing on the international dimension of conflict. We start by reviewing the existing literature linking both fields, in particular research on the relationship between trade and war and on the use of geoeconomic tools such as foreign aid and sanctions. We then highlight four main directions for future research. First, we call for a broader view of the geoeconomic toolkit, as rogue leaders do not limit themselves to economic coercion. In addition to economic weapons, future research should also consider more aggressive—and often costlier—forms of intervention short of war, including sabotage, cyberattacks, covert operations, and the sponsorship of terrorism or insurgency. Second, we require a better understanding of how geoeconomic tools affect the likelihood of conflict. Do sanctions, strategic tariffs, or military aid provoke or deter war?

In this comment, we raise several concerns regarding the analytical and the empirical parts of the Battisti et al.’s inquiry that bear on this effect. In particular, when Battisti et al. formulate a rule for the division between a worker and a _rm of the surplus that arises from a firm-worker match, Battisti et al. neglect to take into account the fact that wages are taxed. When Battisti et al. formulate the GDP identity, the incorporation of capital is done incorrectly. Calibration of a corrected model undertaken in this comment reveals that these issues affect measurably the empirical results regarding the impacts on the welfare of native workers of skill-neutral migration and of migration by low-skill workers. An additional concern is that our calibration of a corrected model yields estimates of the tax rate on workers’ wages that are far too high to be considered feasible. This suggests to us that even when the model of Battisti et al. is corrected, a structural revision is deemed necessary in order to deliver a useful tool for measuring the effect of migration on the welfare of native workers in the 20 OECD countries. As a step in this direction, we calibrate a version of the corrected model, which involves “reasonable” tax rates on wages and a budget deficit. The results yielded by this counterfactual version lend support to the results of the corrected model regarding the negative impact of skill-neutral migration and of migration by low-skill workers on the welfare of native workers.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaf033", "doi": "10.1093/jeea/jvaf033", "journal_full": "Journal of the European Economic Association", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9957990497067998}, {"title": "Ideas Have Consequences The Impact of Law and Economics on American Justice", "authors": "Elliott Ash, Daniel L Chen, Suresh Naidu", "abstract": "This paper empirically studies the effects of the early law-and-economics movement on the U.S. judiciary.

To answer this question, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model with heterogeneous financial intermediaries, incomplete markets, and aggregate uncertainty. We find that market incompleteness and uninsured idiosyncratic bank rate of return risk generate minimal concentration in the bank net worth distribution, leading to an “as-if” result, whereby the economy behaves as if it had a representative bank. However, introducing ex ante heterogeneity in the banks’ rates of return significantly raises concentration and amplifies real and financial fluctuations relative to the representative-bank case, as this increases a key sufficient statistic, the average marginal propensity to lend. We then extend the model with two empirically validated features of the banking sector—countercyclical return risk and deposit market power—and show that these amplify and dampen aggregate fluctuations, respectively. Finally, because in the model with ex ante heterogeneity the distribution of bank size is highly concentrated, shocks to the largest banks can account for almost all of the aggregate variation that is due to idiosyncratic risk, leading to granular banking and economic cycles. The failure of granular banks (“too big to fail”) produces sizeable macroeconomic crises.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf062", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdaf062", "journal_full": "The Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009555809240646918}, {"title": "Moral migration and transnationalism: Russian anti-war resistance after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine", "authors": "Oula Kadhum", "abstract": "This paper examines the role of morality in migration and transnationalism, focussing on the case of Russian anti-war migration and activism against the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and Putin’s regime. Drawing on moral philosophy and psychology, I argue that Russian departure and activism can be conceptualised as moral migration and transnationalism, defined as “decisions, reasoning, judgements and acts of resistance motivated by obligatory concerns for others’ welfare, rights, fairness and justice”. Applying this to Russian anti-war activism abroad, the paper underlines how the act of migration can be conceptualised as a form of moral protest, especially for citizens from authoritarian states and autocratic regimes. It also emphasises the role of morality in transnational mobilisation choices and causes activists take up, as well as the moral dilemmas and controversies these present for anti-war communities and movements. By foregrounding the significance of morality, this study seeks to redress its neglect in migration and transnationalism scholarship and underscores the importance of moral theory in the analysis of international politics.

The literature on conflict-driven displacement has primarily focused on how civil wars affect external migration, identifying social networks and exposure to violence as the primary reasons for displacement. A rapid invasion by a foreign power may paint a different picture. At the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, millions fled to other parts of Ukraine or abroad. As Ukraine recaptured territory and the front lines stabilized, many returned. This study assesses the demographics of IDPs and returnees through a survey conducted in Ukraine in May and June 2022. IDPs were more educated and less likely to take the survey in Russian. Respondents who had more favorable attitudes about the incumbent president and held anti-democratic views were more likely to return after displacement. IDPs who left and then returned were more likely to be younger and more educated than respondents who never left.

Unlike figures commonly framed as human smugglers, these actors are portrayed by migrants as offering selective assistance outside a purely commercial logic, often with minimal or no financial compensation. Drawing on qualitative interviews with migrants and individuals who interact with such facilitators, the research explores how their roles, motivations, and vulnerabilities are discursively constructed. The findings suggest that these “facilitators” symbolically disrupt the dominant migration economy by challenging profit-driven models of smuggling, provoking narrative contestation, reputational attacks, and heightened legal scrutiny. Using the concepts of anchoring and objectification from social representations theory, the analysis reveals how facilitators are framed in contrast to smugglers, highlighting themes of moral positioning, trust, and selective solidarity. Rather than reflecting fixed categories, these distinctions emerge from the stories told by migrants navigating complex moral and economic landscapes.

Survey recruitment through Meta advertisements is one such approach.

The familial power dynamics unfold across spaces and temporalities at various scales and reveal the work invested in creating the international and diplomatic ‘façade’. Drawing on research carried out in 2022–2023 with diplomats, representatives of international organisations and their family members from Latvia, this article examines four domains within which power dynamics operate: couple relationships; relationships with children; extended and non‐kin relationships; and ‘doing family’ in broader diplomatic and international communities. Applying a family lens to such highly skilled mobilities extends critical discussions on skills and power in diplomacy and international relations – often perceived as male‐dominated areas of work – and illuminates how familial relationships are contingent on making these mobilities possible over space, time, and generations. Furthermore, the focus on family sheds a new light on pertinent issues, such as the relationship between (trans)nationalism and family and the production of social and cultural capital across spaces.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70096", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70096", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.028041099082844245}, {"title": "Epidemiology models explain rumour spreading during France’s Great Fear of 1789", "authors": "Stefano Zapperi, Constant Varlet-Bertrand, Cécile Bastidon, Caterina A.

Five databases were searched (up to 31 December 2023) for systematic reviews with meta-analyses exploring the effects of CAIM in autism. Independent pairs of investigators identified eligible papers and extracted relevant data. Included meta-analyses were reestimated using a consistent statistical approach, and their methodological quality was assessed with AMSTAR-2. The certainty of evidence generated by each meta-analysis was appraised using an algorithmic version of the GRADE framework.

We found no high-quality evidence to support the efficacy of any CAIM for core or associated symptoms of autism. Although several CAIMs showed promising results, they were supported by very low-quality evidence. The safety of CAIMs has rarely been evaluated, making it a crucial area for future research.

This study examined whether communication improves cooperative decision-making among college students under conditions in which the payoff structure had to be inferred through repeated play.

We show that, irrespective of language and geographical origin, chants share distinctive acoustic traits, namely relatively flat and slow-changing intonation and steady, unbroken voicing in a comfortable, rather low pitch range with a prevalence of mid-central vowels. Thus, chants are produced in a relaxed vocal tract configuration with minimal articulation. Additionally, playback experiments involving original chants (with a participant pool of 61 listeners), resynthesized chants (with 114 listeners), and fully synthetic chants (with 80 listeners) demonstrate that these acoustic characteristics enhance listeners’ perceived sensations of relaxation. Specifically, relatively flat and slow-changing intonation, combined with vowel production in a relatively relaxed vocal tract configuration, resulted in higher overall relaxation ratings.

Major cultural events—the terrorist attacks of September 11th, the 2008 financial crisis, and the COVID-19 pandemic—were systematically linked to changes in legacy reflections about personal values, with security declining after 9/11, achievement declining after the financial crisis, and benevolence declining for years after COVID-19 began and, to date, not yet returning to baseline. Gender and age of the deceased were also linked to differences in legacy: Men were remembered more for achievement , power , and conformity , while women were remembered more for benevolence and hedonism . Older people were remembered more for tradition and conformity than younger people. These patterns shifted dynamically across the lifespan, with obituaries for men showing more age-related variation than legacies for women.

These expansions prompt difficult trade-offs between conservation, social, and economic interests. A key factor in securing legitimacy and practical feasibility for expansion regimes is understanding what factors determine public support for them. Using survey and experimental data, we show that in eight countries across five continents, public opinion is 1) strongly in favor of the “30-by-30”-target and 2) highly consistent regarding policy priorities for the design of international- and domestic-level expansion regimes. We find that for international-level policy regimes, support increases with protection responsibilities equally split between countries, rich countries bearing higher costs, more countries actively cooperating, and placement trade not allowed. For domestic-level policy regimes, support generally increases when nature values are prioritized over social or economic values and, in many countries, decreases when costs are borne by a general tax increase, parks are managed by private companies, and when access to parks is restricted.

Evidence From 40 Major Economies During the Global Financial Crisis and the Covid‐19 Recession", "authors": "Vegard Tørstad, Jon Hovi, Håkon Sælen", "abstract": "The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the 2020 Covid‐19 pandemic triggered large economic stimulus packages in most countries. While aimed primarily at saving the domestic economy from widespread bankruptcies and mass unemployment, these stimulus packages also offered governments windows of opportunity for pivoting toward decarbonization. Drawing on a new dataset covering 40 of the world's largest economies' stimulus spending during the two crises, this article addresses two questions: (1) Did the allocation toward green investments increase in government stimulus packages from the GFC to the Covid‐19 downturn? (2) What country characteristics are associated with green stimulus spending in each crisis? Grounded in distributive‐conflict theory, we hypothesize that the relative strength of green and fossil stakeholders in the economy is decisive in shaping climate policy outcomes. Consistent with this theory, our empirical analysis reveals (1) a (small) uptick in major economies' net green spending from 2008 to 2020 and (2) that robust green industrial interests strongly predict cross‐country variation in green stimulus spending. In contrast, countries' levels of fossil fuels production did not exert a proportional influence. Notably, our research also uncovers a pattern of path dependency, with countries leading in green stimulus spending during the GFC maintaining this position also through the Covid‐19 pandemic.

More specifically, means‐tested social assistance appears to promote support by reducing self‐experienced economic hardship and lessening value conflicts among individuals with strong eco‐social values.

First, we ask whether educational inequality in geographical Europe is shaped to a larger extent by the country or the region within the country where an individual resides. Second, we investigate whether convergence in levels of educational inequality has occurred across territorial units in Europe. Such convergence could take three different forms: (1) convergence across regions within each country (intra-country convergence), (2) convergence across countries but not regions (inter-country convergence), or (3) convergence across countries and regions within countries (full convergence). To address these questions, we analyse data from the European Social Survey (years 2002 to 2020) covering 248 regions in 25 countries. We estimate a three-level hierarchical linear probability model, with individuals (level 1) nested in regions (level 2) nested in countries (level 3). The model allows random slopes for parental education to vary across regions and countries. Our findings show that regional variation within countries accounts for about 15 to 33 percent of overall spatial variation in educational inequalities across Europe.

We address this gap by studying a program to improve the ability of households to withstand episodes of water scarcity in Mexico City, implemented between presidential cycles. In contrast to conventional forms of social policy, this intervention prioritizes building future resilience instead of immediate material benefits. We take advantage of the means-tested nature of the program to reduce imbalances between treated and control neighbors and estimate a difference-in-differences to evaluate its impact on electoral outcomes. We find that neighborhoods receiving this adaptation policy had, on average, higher levels of support for the party in charge of its implementation at the presidential and gubernatorial levels, compared to similar neighborhoods that did not receive the program.

This study adopts a life-course perspective, tracking poverty from birth to age 10 for cohorts born in Britain between 1991 and 2017. On average, 17% of children spent at least half of their childhood in poverty. Long-term poverty affected 25% of those born in the early 1990s, markedly declined to 13-14% for cohorts born after the 1997 welfare reforms, and substantially increased again to 23% for children born following the 2013 austerity reforms. Decomposition analysis shows that cross-cohort changes are driven more by shifts in the penalties associated with work and family risk factors than by changes in their prevalence. These shifts in penalties reflect broader changes in redistribution and predistribution. The early decline in long-term poverty was largely due to rising employment and earnings in low-income households, while the post-austerity increase stems mainly from reduced redistribution.

While most research has focused on prevalence, teacher behaviours, or household risk factors, little is known about how adolescents’ own beliefs and peer normative environments shape their vulnerability to teacher violence. Methods: This study analysed nationally representative Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) from five countries: Eswatini (2021), Mozambique (2019), Kenya (2019), Namibia (2019), and Lesotho (2018), focusing on 10,904 school-going adolescents aged 13-17 years. Logistic regression models estimated associations between individual endorsement of corporal punishment, peer-level attitudes (measured using leave-one-out peer endorsement), and reported experience of teacher violence. Results were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Findings: show that 13.6% of adolescents reported teacher corporal punishment in the past year. More than half (52.8%) endorsed corporal punishment, with peer endorsement averaging 53%. Adolescents who endorsed corporal punishment had twice the odds of experiencing teacher violence (aOR=2.1, 95% CI:1.6-2.7). Each 10-percentage-point increase in peer endorsement was associated with a 10% increase in odds (aOR=1.1, 95% CI: 1.0-1.2). Gender moderated these associations: while boys were generally more exposed, girls who endorsed corporal punishment in pro-corporal peer contexts faced sharply elevated risks. Associations varied across countries, with the strongest effects in Kenya. Conclusion: The findings highlight adolescents and peers as overlooked but critical drivers of school violence. Prevention strategies must therefore extend beyond legal bans and teacher training to also shift adolescent attitudes, peer climates, and home–school linkages. Evidence from interventions such as the Good School Toolkit (Uganda), Green Dot bystander program (U.S.), and SASA! (Uganda) demonstrates that norms change is possible.

Evidence also shows, for example, greater economic transformation through fiscal federalism. South Africa, for example, has less significant decentralisation but greater capacity to collect tax revenues. The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties.

We study inequalities in pre-school learning contexts by immigrant origin, using full population register data that matches all children to their families and pre-schools. Enrolment in pre-school is lower for children of immigrants, but this is – surprisingly – almost entirely driven by low enrolment of children in non-refugee families. Contrary to expectations, children from origin groups with larger school difficulties have high pre-school enrolment rates. Our results suggest that explanations for low enrolment should primarily be sought in intentions to remain long-term in the host country. In pre-schools, immigrant background children have a somewhat higher teacher density, but a somewhat lower density of qualified teachers, and a somewhat higher turnover rate and sickness absence among teachers. These differences are however small. Where we see large differences is in the composition of the child and teacher group: Immigrant-background children go to pre-schools where a much higher proportion of teachers and children have immigrant background. We conclude that hopes to equalize school outcomes through encouraging pre-school enrolment are misplaced, and equalizing structural indicators is unlikely to make a big difference.

We apply template matching to adjust for six sets of confounders. We find a significant, positive effect of using streaming platforms on the diversity of cultural consumption, measured by the number of cultural genres declared to be consumed, across three domains (music, movies, and TV shows) as well as on cosmopolitanism, measured by the propensity to watch movies and TV shows in a foreign language. The magnitude of this effect is relatively low for music(0.1 sd, 0.2 genres), intermediate for movies (0.2 sd, 0.6 genres), but high for TV shows (0.46 sd, 1.2 genres). The study brings new evidence against the filter bubble thesis; it shows that platforms do reinforce cultural inequalities by increasing the gap in consumption diversity between the working classes and the elite.

Our first question was to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services at different income levels. Based on our newly introduced compensation ratio measure, we showed that the combination of child contingent benefits and out-of-pocket costs tends to be low-income targeted, in the sense that lower-income families pay lower fees for childcare and/or receive higher benefits. In Poland and Sweden, the out-of-pocket expenses for childcare tended to be lower (on average) across the income distribution than child-contingent benefits, whereas high-income families in Belgium and Spain paid more for childcare than they received as financial support. Secondly, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services for different family types. Here, we found that generally (with the exception of Spain) families with more children receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to families with fewer children. In all the four countries studied here, single-parent families receive higher child-contingent benefits relative to their out-of-pocket costs for childcare, compared to two-parent families. Finally, we asked to what extent child-contingent benefits compensate for the out-of-pocket costs of formal childcare services when families transition into work. Here, we found that, generally, the compensation ratio was higher for families on social assistance or employment at low wages, compared to families working at higher wages. This holds for single-parent families (with the exception of Poland) as well as two-parent families. Moreover, the extent to which the compensation rate was lowered with employment and at higher wage levels differed between countries, with the drop particularly notable in Belgium and moderate to absent in Poland. For average wage employees, the compensation ratio was lowest in Belgium compared to the other countries included here.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r6kdh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/r6kdh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007472555034160444}, {"title": "A Data-driven Study of Variables Associated with Locus of Control in the Next Steps Cohort", "authors": "Siqi Wu, George Ploubidis, Richard J.

Healthcare professionals play a key role in addressing alcohol consumption, yet little is known about older adults’ attitudes towards these conversations. This study aimed to: 1) examine older adults’ attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations with GPs, practice nurses, district nurses and volunteers; and 2) explore associations between these attitudes and older adults’ socio-demographic characteristics and alcohol consumption. Methods: A cross-sectional survey (N = 424) was conducted to collect data on socio-demographics, alcohol consumption and attitudes towards alcohol-related conversations. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between personal characteristics and attitudes. Results: Support for routinely asking about alcohol consumption was highest for GPs (60.4%), followed by practice nurses (55.0%), district nurses (46.7%) and volunteers (17.5%). Older adults aged 75 and older were more likely to view alcohol use as a personal matter and were less likely to initiate conversations with GPs (OR 0.66, CI 0.43–1.00) or district nurses (OR 0.60, CI 0.38–0.94), compared to those younger than 75. High-risk drinkers were more likely to have negative attitudes towards district nurses routinely addressing alcohol consumption (OR 0.54, CI 0.29–0.99).

We find that maternal NSWS is associated with increased social-emotional difficulties in children, particularly when mothers work at night. Among the three mechanisms, maternal depression emerges as the most significant mediator, followed by regular bedtime routines.

These new data sources allow for high-resolution analysis of how people move through cities and interact across diverse neighborhoods. A key goal behind this work is to inform the design of inclusive spaces that foster intergroup contact and social cohesion. However, much of this research has focused on statistical diversity (typically measured through census data, mobility traces, or indices that capture the distribution and co-presence of social groups) while giving less consideration to how diversity is perceived by those who use these spaces. This study bridges that gap by combining GIS-based mobility modeling with on-street survey data. Using aggregated mobility data from ~90,000 mobile phone users in Auckland, New Zealand, we estimated ethnic mobility flows and computed spatial diversity indices for residents and visitors across six neighborhoods. In parallel, we conducted 249 on-street surveys in those neighborhoods to capture perceptions of diversity. Our findings reveal only a weak correlation between statistical and perceived diversity, highlighting that individuals do not simply mirror demographic compositions in their perceptions. Instead, perceived diversity is more strongly predicted by self-reported intergroup contact (both within the specific neighborhood and across the city) and by affective factors such as space affinity and attitudes toward outgroup members. These results underscore the importance of integrating both statistical and perceptual data to understand diversity in urban environments.

This study uses two dominant orientations in the field that take technological (i.e., Shannon-Weaver model) or social (i.e., pragmatics) approaches to deception as guiding theories to inform theoretical codes for a deductive qualitative analysis and pattern matching approach. The thematic codes are applied to a systematic interdisciplinary sample of information disorder studies articles from 2010-2021 identified by Broda and Strömbäck’s meta-synthesis. The findings indicate that a significant proportion of the sample is moving towards an integrated consideration of intentional and unintentional deception by including both technological and social components. Specifically, techno-centric approaches are moving towards including contexts of message providers or receivers in their models. These combined approaches that consider both context of individuals and technological components of message transmission do not adhere to either of the theoretical perspectives examined. Future research should formally integrate the competing assumptions in technological and social models of information disorder to better align with the literature. These methods contribute to the assessment and refinement of the dominant approaches to information disorder as well as identifying gaps for future research. Specifically, there are many ways the sample operationalizes each model component. There is not a “correct” way to measure each component but future research is needed to assess if each operationalization is measuring the same construct.

Thus, Anthropological Economics is expected to be inter-related to other disciplines of Economics, but remain complementary to them i.e., it is not expected that it will intrude into other sub-fields of economics, replace them, or override their principles in any way. It will therefore draw upon other aspects of economic theory, and enrich them suitably. It is therefore expected that all aspects of Economic theory will be taken into consideration for policy formulation and decision-making, including those of Anthropological economics, and independent, context-specific judgment will always be applied. The new proposed field of Anthropological Economics proposes to take the idea of Human Welfare to its logical conclusion by extending the work already carried out in various sub-disciplines of economics, and integrating it more tightly with various concepts in Anthropology. Many new tools and techniques are therefore, proposed as a part of this paper, and we believe these will suitably enrich the field of Economics as well.

Leveraging modern redistricting software, we simulate millions of alternative Census tract maps that satisfy Census guidelines, compute segregation for each, and recover the full probabilistic distribution of common indices. These simulations yield new estimates of racial segregation across U.S. cities and, crucially, measure the aggregation‑induced variability hidden in conventional estimates. Encouragingly, values calculated with official tract definitions closely track the mean of the simulated distribution, exhibiting only a slight upward bias, and segregation metrics shift modestly across maps—though variability grows in smaller cities. While our findings confirm the practical robustness of Census tracts, our data and software provide a general framework for diagnosing and correcting spatial‑aggregation error in other contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nv5up_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/nv5up_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0867096535490196}, {"title": "What is a Cross-platform Alternative News Environment? Tracing Information Flow Across Nine Social Media Platforms based on Mutual URL Sharing", "authors": "Jakob Bæk Kristensen", "abstract": "Contemporary news and opinion dissemination is characterized not by a fixed set of senders and receivers, but by networked information flows and active curation by multiple types of actors, from professional organizations, politicians and journalists to interest groups, pundits and opinionated individuals. Approaches to analyzing news dissemination on social media need to take stock of the broader information sharing environment that news sharing is part of. This study presents a general approach for analyzing large-scale information flows on social media in a cross-platform context by tracing URLs. Using a selection of alternative news media outlets from Germany, Austria, Sweden and Denmark as a starting point for operationalizing the broader news sharing environment that alternative news content is shared within, this study traces URL sharing across Facebook, Twitter (X), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, Vkontakte, Gab and 4Chan in multiple iterations of snowball sampling. A total of ~900 million posts are collected, followed by a two-pronged analysis of 1) general cross-platform flows and platform outflow/inflow dynamics and 2) cross-platform characteristics of networks based on repeated mutual URL sharing among actors. Each part of the analysis considers both URLs that simply appear on multiple platforms as well as those that are shared directly from one platform to another. Results show that one third of all URLs that appear in more than one post are cross-platform, with 17% being shared directly from one platform to another. Modelling mutual URL sharing behavior as a network shows that only 16 – 24% of the network is strictly single platform. Additional specific platform dynamics are presented and discussed in relation to previous findings on cross-platform content sharing.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pq6s3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/pq6s3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006759680838489546}, {"title": "‘Baleful Influence’: A Conceptual Analysis of Militarism", "authors": "Srdjan Vucetic, Bryan Mabee", "abstract": "Militarism, broadly defined as a set of social practices that highlight the utility of organized violence, plays a central role in global security and military affairs.

In early Scandinavian law, the vargr marked those expelled from society through outlawry, a formal ritual that maintained social cohesion. Drawing from Jungian depth psychology, the vargr can be seen as a scapegoat for the community's shadow-the rejected parts of the self, including rage, shame, and transgression. This mirrors René Girard's theory of scapegoating, where societies manage inner tension by casting blame onto an external figure. The wolf's wild and dangerous image reinforced its role as a symbolic container for threat. Norse sagas and Thing-site archaeology support the vargr's cultural and legal significance. In contemporary psychological terms, the vargr archetype illuminates how modern individuals manage exclusion and disowned identity.

Anthropological Historiography, with its myriad and multiple interfaces with other sciences is also expected to play a major role in promoting a scientific temper among the laity and the general public and trigger shifts in individual and societal orientations in due course by countering popular perceptions on many issues that impact their daily lives and making outdated and popular paradigms and ideologies redundant. We expect that Anthropological Historiography will play a major role in marginalizing fringe movements besides leading to an enhanced understanding of various aspects of science, history and ethnology among the population and ushering in intellectual movements where such movements are long overdue, and very indirectly leading to a quantum increase in scientific endeavours.

Using a simple specification of a research proposal peer review process, simulations are carried out to explore the ways in which decision reliability, bias, extent of decision randomisation and other factors interact. As might be expected, based on both logic and existing knowledge, randomisation has the potential to reduce bias, but it may also reduce decision reliability as inferred from the F1 score and accuracy of a simulated binary (successful, rejected) decision outcome classification process. Bias is also found, in one sense and qualitatively, to be rather insensitive to partial randomisation as it is typically applied in real-world situations.

Through the application of six mechanisms – implicature, presupposition, pragmatic inferences, modality, genericity, and nominalisation (AUSTIN, 1975; CARLSON, 2011; GRICE, 1975; HEUSINGER; MAIENBORN; PORTNER, 2011; SIMONS, 2005; SPERBER; WILSON, 1995; STALNAKER, 1973; VON FINTEL, 2006) — I propose an analytical model that demonstrates how these linguistic resources can be exploited to create interpretive distortions. Although other mechanisms are available, I focus on these six as they are persistent in misinformation contexts. The analysis identifies five main manipulative strategies: (1) suggestion of biased meanings without explicit commitment to truth conditions, (2) naturalisation of controversial content as established fact, (3) obscuring the degree of commitment between epistemic necessity and deontic obligation, (4) promotion of essentialist universalisations, and (5) suppression of information about agents and responsibilities. The linguistic strategies that sustain misinformation are exemplified through a viral 2023 news story about inclusive terminology for transgender patients in healthcare. The case study serves as a paradigmatic example to demonstrate mechanisms commonly employed by misinformation fabricators. The results contribute to the semantics-pragmatics interface by operationalising the distinction between what is said and what is implicated, revealing how context-dependency mechanisms can be instrumentalised for manipulation, offering perspectives on semantic compositionality and pragmatic inferential processes, and contributing to media literacy and the growing field of digital pragmatics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tdn9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8tdn9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010141883613811187}, {"title": "Elite philanthropy: how do we understand the givers?

Drawing on 182 empirical studies identified through comprehensive database searches and citation analysis, this review shows that existing research is geographically skewed towards the United States and the United Kingdom. The findings reveal patterns in research themes, theoretical perspectives, and methodological choices - alongside major gaps, including limited studies in non-Western contexts, consequently failing to explore differing cultural and religious dimensions, and highlights the sparsity of empirical support for widely held critical assumptions.

To investigate and uncover the ways in which ideology and power relations are subtly reproduced in discourse, we have examined what makes Old Major and Squealer persuasive in the expression of their ideologies. The analysis is grounded on the main tenets and principles of Critical Discourse Analysis. Unlike any other forms of linguistic analysis, the main purpose of CDA is explicitly socio-political, since it seeks to better represent the role of discourse in the reproduction of dominance and power struggle. Therefore, we have adopted Fairclough’s three-dimensional framework: description, interpretation and explanation. In addition, we have capitalized on Aristotle’s approach of persuasion (ethos, pathos and logos) to be as a supporting analytical tool of linguistic and rhetorical devices. Thus, the analytical part of this research work has analyzed the possible interrelatedness of textual properties and their conveyance of a particular ideology by giving it an eclectic treatment as far as the application of framework is concerned. The findings of this investigation uncover the linguistic and rhetorical techniques that contribute to the overall process of persuasion, which have different ideological attachments.

This paper proposes a dual-track approach of ‘PQC baseline + QKD enhancement’ to comprehensively compare the standard systems, governance models, and engineering progress of China and the United States in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD). The study employs a three-tier evidence integration framework of ‘policy-standards-engineering,’ combining authoritative documents from NIST, OMB, CISA, and other sources with China's national standard platform and industry announcements. It constructs an analysis model of ‘standard hierarchy-migration ecosystem-international interoperability’ and evaluates the feasibility of the scheme through gap-risk mapping, roadmap design, and KPI matrix assessment. The results show that the United States has established a closed-loop system of ‘primary standards + redundancy’ based on FIPS 203/204/205 and HQC backup algorithms, and has entered an auditable implementation phase driven by mandatory migration and toolchain initiatives from OMB and CISA; China maintains an advantage in QKD engineering and standardisation, but national standards for PQC have not yet been solidified, and the migration governance system lags behind, resulting in a structural shortfall of ‘engineering leading the way while algorithm standards lag behind.’ Based on this, this paper proposes a ‘three-year-five-year-ten-year’ national roadmap: establish a standardised baseline within three years, achieve large-scale migration and verification within five years, and complete consolidation and internationalisation within ten years. This will be supplemented by protocols, PKI/certificates, key lifecycle management, testing and certification, and algorithm switching mechanisms, in conjunction with a five-tier governance structure led by the State Cryptography Administration, with TC260/TC485 as the technical focal points, and the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology/ the Cyberspace Administration of China/People's Bank of China, operator and critical infrastructure implementation, and research institutes.

However, the effectiveness of such summaries in communicating the overall quality of the primary studies included in a systematic review remains understudied. Objectives: This study aims to assess how the design of a systematic review summary affects readers' perception of methodological quality of primary studies, their perception of the evidence's definitiveness and their attitudes towards the policy intervention discussed in the review. Data and Methods: Using a web-based experimental design, two studies were conducted to examine how various presentation formats, including the emphasis on methodological limitations and the use of images, influence readers’ perceptions of information presented in a systematic review summary. Results: Emphasizing methodological limitations significantly reduces readers' perception of the quality of the methods used in the studies included in a systematic review summary. Yet, highlighting methodological limitations does not influence people's perception of the definitiveness of the review findings or their attitude toward related policies. Furthermore, removing the images from the summary’s standard design appears to have minimal effect on how readers interpret information about methodological limitations. Conclusions: Modifications to the traditional summary design can amplify the awareness of laypeople and civil servants regarding methodological limitations in the scientific evidence.

Contributing to Critical Disinformation Studies, the paper demonstrates how a prevailing atomist perception of fake news validates the persistent—though increasingly problematised—modelling of Western fact-checking into an impartial fake news detector.

Understanding caregiver beliefs and everyday practices may help improve communication and service uptake. Methods: 17 parents from diverse backgrounds across London, England, participated in autophotographic photo-elicitation interviews exploring daily routines. Interview data were analysed using interpretive critical discourse analysis to identify norms and beliefs surrounding children’s weight and weight-related behaviours. Results: Five discourses were identified: (1) Food at the Centre of Weight; (2) BMI as an Indicator, not a Diagnosis; (3) Homecooked Food as Nourishment; (4) Negotiating Challenges for a “Balanced Diet”; and (5) Activity for Enjoyment and Development – not Health. Parents viewed children’s weight as primarily shaped by food and diet, and rejected BMI as a standalone measure of healthy weight. Dietary practices centred on balancing nourishing homecooking with less nourishing foods, while physical activity was valued for its developmental benefits. Conclusions: Caregiver discourse revealed tensions between everyday norms and dominant public health messaging around children’s weight. In England, communications may be strengthened by acknowledging the limitations of BMI, resisting diet-centric framings, and aligning more closely with caregiver perspectives on food and activity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5bct_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/q5bct_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0071874235199447245}, {"title": "Liderazgo Sostenible Integral: Hacia un modelo teórico para integrar conciencia, competencias y coherencia interna en el liderazgo del siglo XXI", "authors": "Jose Alejandro Cueto Portocarrero", "abstract": "El presente artículo propone el modelo de Liderazgo Sostenible Integral (MLSI) como una nueva arquitectura teórica para comprender el liderazgo en contextos de complejidad, urgencia e interdependencia. A partir de una revisión crítica de los principales enfoques contemporáneos —incluyendo el liderazgo transformacional, emocional, servidor, auténtico, regenerativo y sostenible clásico— se identifican limitaciones comunes, como la fragmentación entre acción y conciencia, la ausencia de un marco integrado que contemple el equilibrio interno del líder, y la débil articulación entre desempeño, propósito y sostenibilidad ética. El modelo propuesto se organiza en tres componentes interdependientes: (1) competencias generadoras (visión, inteligencia emocional y disciplina), de las cuales emergen habilidades funcionales y posibles distorsiones; (2) conexiones como indicadores de calidad del impacto (interna, social y ecológica); y (3) estado interno como núcleo dinámico desde el cual el líder percibe, decide y actúa, influido por factores narrativos, emocionales, neurobiológicos y contextuales. Este enfoque redefine la sostenibilidad del liderazgo no solo como capacidad de generar resultados duraderos, sino como la habilidad de sostener procesos transformadores sin deteriorar la integridad personal, relacional ni ecológica. Se presentan fundamentos epistemológicos, estructura conceptual y líneas de investigación futuras, incluyendo validación empírica, estudios sobre el estado interno y diseño de programas formativos.

Critically analysing the multimodal discourse of a long-standing climate denial front group on Instagram", "authors": "Caroline Gardam", "abstract": "Problematic climate information affects public support for mitigation policies. Frequently distributed through a powerful coalition of contrarian actors—the climate change counter movement (CCCM)—it undermines scientific evidence to protect vested interests through ongoing promotional campaigns. On social media, image-based climate misinformation often outperforms verified content. Instagram, with its multimodal vernacular, is a crucial platform for climate misinformation research. In this paper, a novel, visual-first exploratory method combines unsupervised machine learning with multimodal critical discourse analysis. I employ a custom computational tool, the ‘Image Machine, to identify dominant visual signatures and discursive themes in a dataset of 15,000 Instagram posts, collected via hashtags representing climate denial discourse. Cluster analysis reveals a distinct visual signature that represents the branding logics of established contrarian front group, Friends of Science Society (FoS). Through multimodal critical discourse analysis of a visual cluster and representative post case study, this research interrogates the discursive strategies and climate denial rhetoric of FoS that—through deliberate intertextual, multimodal tactics that exploit Instagram’s affordances—aim to confound public climate science knowledge. Findings situate FoS firmly in the role of front group within the denial machine, instrumentally using climate denial as a rhetorical and discursive strategy to support Canada’s fossil fuel interests. Funded by fossil interests, FoS exploits signature visuality to solidify contrarian narratives and reinforce its brand. In documenting individuals and organisations implicit in the FoS funding structure, this research contributes to scholarship about the CCCM, as well introduces a novel methodology to ascribe multimodal—particularly, visual—means for detecting problematic climate information.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vrjxc_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vrjxc_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01003209493718149}, {"title": "Small-area analysis and projections of social housing change", "authors": "Jen Arnold, Stephen Glackin, Steven Rowley, Trevor Kollmann, Piret Veeroja", "abstract": "What this research is about: this research explores concentrations and density of social housing relative to local amenities and services across Australia.

High amenity areas have good access to public transport, schools, medical services, employment opportunities and leisure activities. Many social housing tenants don't have cars. Easy access to services is very important for them.
