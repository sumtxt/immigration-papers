At the same time, several studies point to potential adverse effects, where, for instance, the equal inclusion of women in decision‐making bodies might serve to legitimize anti‐feminist decisions in particular. We argue that such conclusions result from a failure to consider the importance of outcome favorability, a factor long recognized to be of crucial importance in other fields of research. We incorporate outcome favorability theoretically and empirically in several experimental studies and show that what has previously been interpreted as a “dark side” of descriptive representation, instead should be viewed as the power of fair procedures to increase losers’ consent. We contribute to the literature on representation and legitimacy and show how appropriate research design and measurement can shape substantive conclusions on high‐stakes issues.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70021", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70021", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012638695998380411}, {"title": "Notes from the Editors: New Tracks at the APSR", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101159", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101159", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015798950866074746}, {"title": "Race, Responsiveness, and Representation in U.S. Lawmaking", "authors": "G.

Furthermore, this new association between left partisanship and market competition has delivered new distributive gains for labor. I highlight the depressed interest rates across the rich world today in driving this outcome: low rates spark a rise in market concentration, which puts downward pressure on the labor share of income. By boosting market competition, left governments can counter this force and defend the labor share of income, thus revitalizing redistribution for a more difficult economic era.

Chwieroth, Andrew Walter", "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a deep economic crisis that prompted governments and central banks to implement extraordinary fiscal, monetary, and financial interventions. We examine public support for these interventions using a conjoint survey experiment conducted in Australia and the United Kingdom in early 2021. Our experiment innovates by investigating public preferences across two main categories of intervention: (1) wage subsidies designed to address employment and income risks and (2) financial stabilization measures aimed at supporting the balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial institutions. Results show that wagesubsidies received robust public support across diverse social, economic, and experiential cleavages. By contrast, financial and credit market interventions elicited mixed reactions, with strongest opposition toward those benefiting large firms and banks. We argue that the variation in support is primarily driven by an alignment of fairness considerations and policy design. In both countries, wage subsidies had key design features that made them more likely to be perceived as distributionally neutral, consistent with important fairness norms, and limiting the potential for free riding. They were available to all citizens experiencing verifiable employment disruption, delivered through employers, and appealed to welfare-chauvinistic views by excluding many recent immigrants and temporary residents. Moreover, the viral origin of the economic shock was widely perceived as exogenous and quasi-random, and the associated losses – particularly those related to employment and income more readily elicited greater empathy when borne by individuals than by firms. In contrast, financial-sector interventions, especially those aiding large corporations and banks, were less easily viewed as consistent with these fairness norms. These interventions were more prone to being perceived as favoring opportunistic or politically connected firms, echoing earlier public resentment of global financial crisis bailouts. Even some household-targeted financial interventions, such as debt relief and rent holidays, likely raised concerns among respondents about undeserved gains. Unlike some existing studies, our subgroup analysis finds little evidence that personal or local pandemic experiences significantly influenced attitudes toward economic interventions. Individuals who suffered direct health or economic impacts, or who lived in areas with high infection rates or strict lockdowns, were no more or less supportive of interventions. Instead, partisan orientation and perceptions of inequality were more predictive. Left-wing partisans and those who perceived rising or high inequality were especially supportive of wage subsidies and household-focused assistance. Traditional material cleavages – such as income, education, wealth, or asset ownership – had limited explanatory power. The underbanked population was an exception, showing more muted support for all interventions, likely due to perceived exclusion or limited personal benefit. We conclude that public evaluations of economic interventions during the pandemic were shaped less by self-interest or crisis exposure than by judgments about deservingness, fairness, and partisan attachments. Our findings emphasize the importance of policy design and political framing in sustaining public support for large-scale interventions during crises, and they have broader implications for the politics of economic policy in future global shocks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676525100327", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676525100327", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006288738521582404}, {"title": "From Differentiation to Nexus Governance—Dynamics of Change in the UN’s Inter-Institutional Governance of Terrorism and Violent Extremism", "authors": "Ann-Kathrin Rothermel", "abstract": "Despite far-reaching changes in the United Nations’ (UN) counterterrorism architecture, there has been only limited attention to what this means for global and inter-institutional governance dynamics.

Nonetheless, today, there is insufficient guidance for scholars looking to challenge existing concepts. Despite this, numerous social science scholars, particularly qualitative scholars, have long used different solutions for reconstructing existing concepts to make sense of their immediate observations. In this article, we bring together these similar strategies under the banner of a single approach, which we call theory reconstruction . Distinct from both theory building and theory testing, theory reconstruction is an abductive, or “puzzle-based,” approach to research that uses discrepancies between one’s empirical observations and the literature to challenge key concepts. Using examples of existing scholarship, we propose four strategies of theory reconstruction (revising, narrowing, extending, and disrupting), each of which serves as an accessible way to unsettle entrenched assumptions in the discipline, invite new perspectives, and encourage more theory-based research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725101448", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725101448", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010716149899089311}, {"title": "Overriding Nature: Favourable Environments in Early Life Reduces Genetic Inequality in Political Participation", "authors": "Oskar Pettersson", "abstract": "New research indicates that genetic variants related to educational attainment influence individuals’ political participation.

Using longitudinal and geo-coded register data for a large sample of genotyped twins in the Swedish Twin Registry, this paper explores whether early-life proximal environments that are conducive to participation modifies the effects of individuals’ education-related genetic resources on voting, as measured by a polygenic index for educational attainment.

This forum did not lead to concrete political effects, and the deliberative turn reached Vienna only after 2000. Other deliberative practices have been introduced over time.

These are the most inclusive instruments, and many of them allow people who ordinarily lack voting rights to participate.

Jointly analyzing the 10 cases reveals that particularly respondents who evaluate their state as undemocratic report more support for democracy after attacks. Among individuals who perceive their state as democratic, we find no difference in support for democracy. Trust in the president and the ruling party is generally lower after attacks. We propose that citizens respond adversely to limited capacities to express dissatisfaction with the government under perceived non-democratic rule, and thus support democracy more after terrorist attacks when the political system is perceived as undemocratic. In contrast to prior research, our results provide a positive outlook on the resilience of support for democracy in the face of adversity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01334-w", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01334-w", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008562788970893354}, {"title": "Why Do Some Union Members Vote Republican?

However, a sizable minority of union members vote Republican. This is puzzling, given that the national Republican Party has long been hostile toward organized labor. Extant research has clearly demonstrated that union and nonunion members differ in their voting behavior, but we know little about such variation among union members. I explore this latter phenomenon here, arguing that the frequency of workplace political discussion plays an important role in shaping how labor union members vote. I test this with data from the 2004 National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES). Overall, I find that workplace discussion of politics is positively and significantly associated with the probability that labor union members vote Democrat. This appears to occur via a “learning” mechanism, in which greater workplace discussion of politics leads union members to recognize which candidate is more “prolabor.” Overall, these findings help us better understand the consequences of the workplace, political discussion, and the politics of American labor unions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf042", "doi": "10.1093/poq/nfaf042", "journal_full": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007750081725716118}, {"title": "Susceptibility to Moral Arguments Among Liberals and Conservatives", "authors": "Fredrik Jansson, Pontus Strimling", "abstract": "An empirical result in Moral Foundations Theory is that liberals and progressives endorse the individualizing factors of care and fairness, while conservatives claim that the binding factors of authority, loyalty, and purity are equally relevant when determining what is moral.

We examine the methodological challenges of studying transnational LGBTQ+ audiences while accounting for differences in language, culture, and identity. Drawing on insights from queer media studies, decolonial theory, and translation studies, we propose “strategic methodological essentialism” as a framework for conducting cross-cultural audience research. Adapting Gayatri Spivak’s concept of strategic essentialism, this approach advocates the careful use of language and identity categories for the pragmatic purposes of data collection and political engagement, while remaining critically aware of their limitations. Strategic methodological essentialism advocates an embrace of queer failure as a critical method to encourage context-specific approaches that challenge dominant paradigms in audience research and media studies.

Bringing platform studies into dialogue with Asian studies, we argue for a double move of deconstruction and reconstruction: interrogating how platforms are historically framed through metaphors, archives, and business genealogies, and how “Asia” has been imagined through colonial, Cold War, and postcolonial projects. Using Asia as method, we show how regional trajectories of platformization—superapps and platform business groups, infrastructuralization, and the absorption of informal economies—both provincialize Euro-American frameworks and generate new concepts. At a conjuncture marked by an uneven transition beyond neoliberalism, platforms in Asia formalize informality, extend state infrastructures, and mediate global capital, producing hybrid labor regimes and renewed state–platform entanglements while intensifying inequalities. We organize the special issue around four productive tensions: (1) technological/media affordances vs. cultural specificities; (2) methodological localism vs. theory-building; (3) state power vs. transnationalism; and (4) inter-Asia references vs. power inequalities. Across these frictions, contributors trace alternative genealogies (e.g., from Japanese convenience stores to K-pop fandom platforms), analyze platformized labor and entrepreneurial subjectivities, and rethink governance through fragmented, conjunctural state formations. We contend that metaphors are useful to think with—yet the dominance of “platform” as a corporate framing also calls for critical pivots to alternative figures that open different political and analytic possibilities.

First, rather than higher income levels per se, it is the onset of sustained growth that increases the likelihood of democratisation. Intuitively, the faster accumulation of productive factors, such as human capital, reduces conflicts of interest and hence the elite’s resistance to democracy. Second, the economic consequences of democracy are amplified when democratisation occurs after the transition to growth.

Increasing productivity reallocates factors away from agriculture, freeing up land for urban expansion and limiting the increase in land values despite higher income and urban population. With the area of cities growing faster than urban population, urban density can persistently decline, as in the data over a long period.

Returned Migrants as Outsiders in the Home Market", "authors": "Martin Kuka, Kalie Kerpaci", "abstract": "In this article, we investigate the category of returned migrants from Greece who own a small business in Albania. Using the snowball method, we conducted semi‐structured interviews with returnee entrepreneurs, who have been living in three cities of Albania, i.e., Tirana, Vlora and Durrës, for over a year. Our research is focused on the reasons for their return to Albania, the decision to establish a business and the difficulties they face as business owners. We also look at the outcome of their efforts, which is an aspect of Albanian return migration that remains relatively unexplored. In Greece, they had gained work experience and accumulated savings, which they used in Albania. While they were initially optimistic about their decision to return and start a business, they later faced many challenges related to the workings of the market, the relations with the local authorities and their employees, which drove many to closure. Being an entrepreneur in Albania was much more difficult than expected. In this paper, we argue that the returnees' individual skills and resources are not sufficient factors for achieving their entrepreneurial aspirations. Their initiatives are constrained by challenges related to the home country context and weak social networks. For a significant number of returned migrants, the difficulties in dealing with corruption and the poor performance of their business bring an end to their entrepreneurship and force them to remigrate. Hence, this paper looks to contribute to the discussion on factors shaping return decisions, the situation of returnee entrepreneurs and reintegration outcomes, by providing empirical results from an important migration–return–remigration corridor, namely Albania–Greece.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70111", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70111", "journal_full": "International Migration", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.986756265445333}, {"title": "The Intra‐ EU Relocation Scheme of 2015: A Test Run for a Dublin Reform", "authors": "Carolin Nieswandt", "abstract": "In 2015, the first obligatory scheme re‐distributing forced migrants from Italy and Greece to other EU member states was launched.

Drawing on Bourdieu's field‐theoretical approach, this paper treats the relocation scheme as an attempt to appease conflicts over responsibility‐sharing by integrating a relocation procedure into the Dublin system. In so doing, the scheme paved the way for the new solidarity mechanism which will enter into force in 2026 and targets at 30,000 relocations each year. Based on a qualitative investigation, the paper analyses the administrative design of the relocation scheme, and how this implied a redefinition of responsibilities within the European field of asylum administration.

Specifically, analysis of US visa classes theorises here the concurrent accumulation of multimodal value, constituted by: labour subordination (economic value), the making of definition and visibility (optogenic value), alongside classificatory knowledge about migrants (epistemic value) and disciplinary power distributed to institutions, such as farms, companies or universities, that is, where migrants become subjects of governmentality (political value).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70108", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70108", "journal_full": "International Migration", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9864735307657524}, {"title": "Book Review: Did You Say “Migrant”?

This research note contributes to filling this gap through empirical research, prompting a dialogue between socio-legal, contentious politics, migration and border studies. In particular, I present and discuss the preliminary findings of a study on the legal mobilisation of pro-migrant civil society organisations at the Southern European borders. These findings, based on a descriptive quantitative media analysis, provide a first overview of the use of the law by civil society organisations in border areas, making it possible to highlight some trends and suggest some relevant hypotheses to be explored in the course of further research. As such, they contribute to the international migration scholarship and policy community, in that they help to develop the study of political contention around migration, with an innovative focus on the use of the law in border areas.

Deploying the socio-digital inequality lens to analyse the data based on a qualitative ethnographic study using interviews and visual methods, the paper exposes the situated and relational casualties in digital environments often deeply shaped by deep-seated, limited and asymmetrical social welfare and infrastructural support as well as the accelerated utility of online platforms for exploitative profiteering.

In this paper, I extend existing scholarship on targeted development by investigating the specificity of donor aid allocation strategies. I ask whether donors vary the type of aid they allocate in response to the type of spillover they experience. Using dyadic aid and migration data on 30 donors and 126 recipient countries from 2007 to 2023, I construct proxy measures of two donor strategies for migration deterrence: an indirect root causes strategy and a direct migration management strategy. I then assess their relationship with permanent-type immigration and asylum-seeker inflows, and find that donors respond to these two types of immigration with increased allocation of both types of aid. However, they do so with different emphases, stressing the root causes approach in response to permanent-type immigration and the migration management approach in response to asylum-seeker inflows. These findings show that donors use official development assistance to simultaneously pursue multiple strategies of migration control, but are responsive to the type of immigration they experience. At a broader level, this paper demonstrates how donors vary development and humanitarian aid composition and not just quantity in response to different types of international spillovers.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251381275", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251381275", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.977713907717705}, {"title": "Migrating Alone or With Family? Mental Health Among Internal and US Return Migrants in Mexico", "authors": "Margherita Odasso", "abstract": "Between 2010 and 2015, more than one million Mexican migrants returned to Mexico from the United States. US return migrants are disadvantaged in terms of health compared to stayers in the destination country and compared to nonmigrants. However, research has rarely considered whether this also holds for internal return migrants. In addition, we know little about heterogeneity in the health of return migrants, particularly whether health differs depending on whether individuals migrated with family members or not. Using representative panel data for the Mexican population from the Mexican Family Life Survey, this article makes several contributions. First, a mental health penalty is found for both US return migrants and internal return migrants compared to nonmigrants in Mexico.

White women high in modern sexism are less likely to favor Harris than some women of color, particularly Asian women.

In a survey of American adults, we find that support for redistributive and symbolic policies is positively correlated across partisan, racial, and regional lines.

Drawing on the migration infrastructure framework and theories of street-level bureaucracy, the research examines how institutional opacity, discretionary decision-making, and the involvement of intermediaries shape refugees’ navigation of complex administrative systems. While visa outsourcing is intended to enhance efficiency, it often compounds barriers for vulnerable groups by producing fragmented and profit-driven service environments. The study adopts an insider researcher methodology and presents two detailed case studies: one involving a former Afghanistani security officer and the other an unaccompanied minor seeking to reunite with family members in Turkey. Both cases expose systemic inefficiencies, inconsistent application of refugee-specific exemptions, and the emotional and financial burdens placed on applicants. Intermediaries emerge as both essential facilitators and ambivalent gatekeepers, stepping into gaps left by rigid procedures and institutional disengagement. Street-level actors, including consular officials, outsourced service providers, and NGO workers, exercise considerable discretion that often undermines humanitarian protections enshrined in law. The findings highlight how refugees’ mobility is shaped not only by legal frameworks but by the interplay of infrastructural fragmentation, procedural opacity, and informal assemblages.

Using data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, this study focuses on a wide range of internal migration and social mobility, along with their associations with mental and cognitive well‐being among Chinese middle‐aged and older adults. By conducting multilevel analyses, this study has found that migration categories with urban characteristics are generally linked to better health outcomes, even though some of the benefits are explained, to varying degrees, by early‐life selective factors, late‐life circumstances, and intergenerational educational mobility. However, the relationships are still nuanced by differing health outcomes. For example, after adjusting for intergenerational educational mobility, urban‐to‐urban migration demonstrates the strongest positive association with later‐life mental health, while rural‐to‐urban migration with an urban hukou (household registration system in China) has the most pronounced cognitive advantages in older age. One essential dimension of social mobility is intergenerational educational mobility.

In participant-level analyses, older adults demonstrated either higher accuracy (Studies 1 and 3) or comparable accuracy (Study 2) relative to younger adults. Furthermore, younger adults consistently tended to judge others as untrustworthy; however, older adults did not exhibit this negativity bias (Studies 1 and 2), and only a milder positivity bias emerged in Study 3. Although these age-related differences, particularly in accuracy, became less evident when face-level variability was considered, the overall results suggest that older adults perform as well as, or even better than, younger adults in terms of FBTJ accuracy and bias.

Focusing on low-income women in rural Niger, Study 1 finds that local mental models of economic success primarily reflect interdependence, grounded in relational factors like advancing social harmony, respectfulness, and collective benefits. As evidenced by data from a United States sample, this contrasts with a more independent model common in the West grounded in personal factors like self-initiative. Study 2 finds empirical support for relational factors (e.g., subjective social standing) in addition to self-oriented personal factors (e.g., self-efficacy) as mechanisms of women’s economic advancement in a highly effective multifaceted poverty reduction program. Study 3 reports a field experiment with program participants (n = 2,628) to compare a Western-derived personal agency intervention and a culturally wise relational agency intervention each to a control.

For that purpose, we follow the PRISMA guidelines for study selection and synthesis, systematically reviewing 22 peer-reviewed studies published between 2014 and 2024, covering the United States and European Union, to assess the impact of asset testing. Our review finds that the real-world implementation of asset tests often undermines their stated goal of poverty reduction. While asset tests can improve targeting, they frequently discourage savings, perpetuate financial insecurity, and create administrative barriers that reduce participation among the most vulnerable. Hard thresholds incentivize dissaving and trap households in precariousness and long-term dependency, while administrative complexity often offsets any efficiency gains. Recent policy reforms-including higher thresholds, inflation-indexing, and asset exemptions-offer promising alternatives, but a persistent tension remains between targeting efficiency and poverty alleviation. We conclude that graduated approaches rather than straight disqualification better align welfare eligibility with the goals of financial resilience and poverty reduction.

CRM is not just a technology; what truly matters are the business processes and human resources that implement them. Technology can only support these two essential components.

Dominant theories in international economics often posit that deeper globalization fosters export expansion and sustained GDP growth. However, the empirical evidence presented here challenges this linear assumption. Findings indicate that higher levels of globalization do not consistently translate into improved export capacity or rising GDP per capita. Instead, structural disruptions—geopolitical tensions, economic shocks, and protectionist trade regimes—frequently constrain anticipated benefits, revealing systemic vulnerabilities within the global economy. Building on interdisciplinary theoretical perspectives from political economy and development studies, the analysis introduces the concept of an optimal investment threshold. This threshold represents a critical level of foreign direct investment (FDI) net outflows, expressed as a percentage of GDP, beyond which the marginal gains of globalization diminish. Exceeding this point can trigger systemic decline, characterized by stagnating GDP growth and weakened trade performance, thereby challenging the sustainability of globalization-driven development models.These insights underscore the need for recalibrated strategies that integrate structural limits into policy design. By promoting inclusive growth through balanced investment flows and coordinated international regulation, the study reframes globalization as a managed process rather than an automatic engine of prosperity.

The empirical evidence is profoundly heterogeneous and often contradictory. Objective: This systematic review with narrative synthesis synthesizes and critically analyzes the literature to assess the effects of such programs on key indicators like poverty, income inequality, social spending (health and education), health outcomes (mortality, infectious diseases), the labor market, and informality. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in five academic databases and grey literature, following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 53 studies and empirical contributions that met predefined selection criteria were included. The risk of bias for each study was assessed, paying special attention to the control of endogeneity and selection bias. Due to the methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the results were synthesized narratively. Results: A minority of studies, often employing methodologies with a higher risk of bias such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), find no significant negative effects. In contrast, a robust body of research, using quasi-experimental designs with a low risk of bias like Instrumental Variables (IV), documents an increase in inequality, a deterioration of health outcomes (especially in tuberculosis and child mortality), and a rise in the informal economy as a consequence of IMF conditionalities. Conclusion: The differences in findings are largely attributed to the diversity of methodologies and the rigor with which they address causal inference. Higher-quality evidence suggests that IMF programs, particularly those with austerity conditionalities and structural reforms, impose significant social costs.

While previous studies have examined its ecological outcomes, few have explored how different institutional models of habitat banking shape who participates in the market and how collaboration unfolds at the landscape scale. Drawing on participatory institutional mapping and 29 interviews with landowners, conservation organisations, planning authorities, and investors in Oxfordshire, we identify and compare three models of habitat banking: (1) for-profit providers leasing land under conservation covenants; (2) institutional not-for-profits managing land; and (3) individual landowners supported by not-for-profit facilitators under legal agreement with planning authorities. We show that for-profit providers tend to foster inclusive participation through risk-sharing finance but limited local collaboration, while not-for- profits enable collaborative governance that advances strategic, landscape-scale nature recovery yet restricts participation to a narrower set of landowners.

While existing classifications such as “fragile,” “failing,” or “least developed” states suggest the potential for eventual progress, the notion of undevelopability challenges this assumption. It signals a qualitative shift: some institutional systems may be fundamentally resistant to transformation within prevailing development paradigms. The term is used diagnostically rather than deterministically. It highlights structural entrenchment—not cultural incapacity or societal failure—and draws attention to contexts where institutions function primarily to sustain elite power, suppress reform, and replicate dysfunction over time.

It concludes by reflecting on the implications for aid architecture, donor strategy, and development theory. Recognizing undevelopability does not imply fatalism.

We construct a new firm-level dataset linking Korean export records with U.S. procurement contracts (1966–1974) to estimate the causal impact of winning a contract on export performance. Winning an initial contract increases a firm’s likelihood of exporting by 46 percentage points and triples its export value. These effects extend beyond sales to the United States: treated firms also expanded into third-country markets. We validate our research design using unique, contemporaneous firm-level export targets, showing that contracts were not anticipated and unrelated to export shocks. The policy had lasting effects. We find that firms treated in the 1960s responded more strongly to South Korea’s heavy and chemical industry drive of the 1970s, indicating that U.S. procurement and domestic industrial policy were complementary.

Self-presentation through images is thus not mere impression management but a practice of subjectivation that materializes power/knowledge formations in visual form. Using an abductive–computational analysis of 73,206 Tinder images collected across thirteen metropolitan areas and across gender and sexuality, the study reconstructs ten Constructions of Attractiveness (COA) and their patterned combinations as Repertoires of Attractiveness (ROA). These typologies reveal how users align with culturally recognizable and field-bound anticipations of attractiveness, transforming embodied dispositions and forms of capital into field-legible visibility. Cross-cultural comparison shows that these repertoires cluster along regional trajectories, suggesting that while gender and sexuality remain significant, digital self-presentation is more strongly structured by broader cultural conjunctive milieus.

Transparency is calibrated to context: internally, AI use is signposted in tools and reinforced through training and personal accountability; externally, the prominence of disclosure scales with system autonomy and editorial oversight, with stronger labelling for no-human-in-the-loop features than for AI-assisted, journalist-edited outputs. We identify nine factors that shape audience-facing disclosure – legal/provider requirements, industry benchmarking, nature of the task, human oversight, system novelty, audience expectations, perceived risk, commercial sensitivities, and design constraints – and five crosscutting challenges, including site-wide consistency (especially on mobile) and potential “transparency backfire.” Conceptually, our analysis links AI transparency to isomorphic pressures and to intersecting institutional logics.

However, there is a lack of research on the topic, in part due to poor quality of miscarriage data. Both surveys and healthcare records likely miss some early pregnancy losses. We compare data from self-reports and healthcare records at the individual level to understand to what extent these data differ and for whom. METHODS: We used healthcare records on miscarriages in Finland linked to self-reported miscarriage data in antenatal appointments, as well as in a national epidemiological survey, FinHealth 2017. The antenatal data was available for all those with a live birth, whereas the survey also captured those without children, but had a smaller sample size. We compared the consistency of records overall and by socio-demographic characteristics using descriptive statistics and multinomial regressions. RESULTS: For over 80% of people, miscarriage data was consistent between self-reports and healthcare records. This was mainly driven by those who had never had a miscarriage, as the share of consistent records dropped to 40% when only those with at least one miscarriage in one data source were analysed. We observed some self-reporting fewer (1-4% among full sample, 7-13% among those with a miscarriage) and some more miscarriages than in healthcare records (8-12% among the full sample, 46-56% among those with a miscarriage). Inconsistency in either direction was often associated with older age, higher parity, and lower education. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare records and self-reports overlap partly in the miscarriages they capture. More miscarriages were observed using self-reports, probably due to some miscarriages managed outside the healthcare system, and differences in miscarriage definition between lay people and healthcare professionals, with the latter having a more restrictive definition.

However, stubbornness is costly---such individuals persist only if subsidized in the recruitment and promotion system despite lower average performance, or if they have a strong intrinsic preference for autonomy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nfgy3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/nfgy3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005647123418547562}, {"title": "Why Small Experimental Effects of Social Media Use Are Compatible With Large Real-World Effects", "authors": "Chris Felton", "abstract": "The social media hypothesis posits that the widespread adoption of social media is largely responsible for the decline in mental health among US teenagers.

I argue that these RCTs provide little evidence against the social media hypothesis: the causal effect identified by RCTs fundamentally differs from the causal effect invoked by the social media hypothesis in at least three ways. First, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of joining social media, whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of quitting social media. Second, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of using social media for many years, whereas RCTs typically identify the effect of quitting social media for several weeks. Third, and most overlooked, the social media hypothesis concerns the effects of altering the behavior of large swaths of the population—a global intervention—whereas RCTs typically identify the effects of local interventions. In such local interventions, a person may be encouraged to quit social media, but both her immediate peers and the general public continue to use social media in large numbers.

No studies have characterised how socio-economic factors associate with knowing a doctor, and the socio-economic diversity of doctors’ social networks, which may contribute to health care inequalities. Methods Social contacts reported by participants of the Great British Class Survey (2011-2013) were analysed to examine (1) how socio-economic factors throughout the life course associated with knowing a doctor socially, among all participants living in the UK (N = 293,912), and (2) the socio-economic diversity of social networks, comparing doctors to other occupational classes, among all UK-based participants aged 23 or above and not retired (N = 230,424). Associations with individual factors were estimated from fixed-effects regression models including adjustment for potential confounders, while associations between outcomes and social strata comprising multiple socio-economic factors in combination were estimated using the intersectional multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) approach. Results Social mixing with doctors was very strongly socio-economically stratified (sample average = 59.3%), with estimated likelihood of knowing a doctor from intersectional models varying between 89.1% (approx. 95% CI: [87.9%-90.1%]) for the most advantaged strata (professional/managerial background + fee-paying (private) school + professional/managerial occupation + ≥ £200,000 income), and only 28.3% [26.3%-30.2%] for the least advantaged (working class background + non fee-paying (state) school + working class occupation + &lt; £10,000 income). Strong associations were observed for several individual factors reflecting socio-economic position from childhood to current day. Among working-age participants, those working as doctors (n = 3,805) had the lowest likelihood of having at least one social contact (of 13 listed) in a working class occupation (adjusted mean probability = 66.0%, 95% CI: [64.3%-67.7%]), significantly lower than both comparable high-income occupations and lower socio-economic status occupations. Doctors from professional/managerial private-school backgrounds were least likely to have working class contacts (54.3%), while doctors from working class state-school backgrounds were most likely (78.0%), albeit still below the sample average (81.5%). Summary Socio-economic position across the life course appears to have a cumulative effect, with the most advantaged almost certain to know a doctor socially. Meanwhile, doctors appear socially isolated from patients from lower socio-economic groups, especially doctors with the most privileged backgrounds. How these inequalities in social contacts affect access to care and patient-doctor interactions is currently unknown, and requires future research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p8xwm_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/p8xwm_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.03706575242509169}, {"title": "Gender, Education, and Work: Labour Market Outcomes in Care and Non-Care Fields in Italy and Finland", "authors": "INVEST Flagship, Nevena Kulic, Irene Prix, Diana-Roxana Galos", "abstract": "A substantial body of research indicates that graduates’ field of study is a key predictor of the gender wage gap.

We ask how gender differences in educational attainment and returns have contributed to change and persistence in the gender income gap, and whether young men have started trailing behind due to women’s relative gains in higher education. While rising real incomes have contributed to a narrowing relative income gap, the absolute gap has decreased more slowly. In the past decade, both real incomes and the gender income gap have stagnated. Our results show that while both men and women in Norway have increased their education levels, women’s gains have been mainly in higher education, while men’s gains have disproportionately been in vocational upper secondary education. Contrary to the situation in the US and other liberal market economies, income growth among men with vocational education in Norway has recently outpaced every other group, resulting in a decreasing college premium, particularly among men.

Citizenship itself is therefore a multiple concept expressed through the occurrences of digitally mediated encounters which I try to capture in this chapter focusing on the deployment of platforms for collaborative governance. This is one emerging aspect of the journey of ‘platform citizenship’ which is perceived as both innovative and necessary vis-a-vis declining traditional political and civic participation. One of these platforms is Decidim, the case-study presented here: this has been conceived by ethical hackers and activists in Barcelona and has become an internationally awarded and replicated project. In order to analyse the relationship between places and technologies, and to radically contextualise software relations further, I use the Scaffold of Smart Citizen Participation (Cardullo and Kitchin, 2019a).

This study examines (1) how the absence of children and/or a partner is associated with exchange of support between siblings and (2) how intragenerational geographic proximity shapes these associations. Research Design and Methods This study utilizes multilevel ordinal logistic regressions of frequencies of exchanging practical help plus logistic regressions of providing personal care and population-based survey data from the Generational Transmissions in Finland project connected to register data about individuals aged 68–74 years in 2018 and their siblings. Results Siblings were found to be active supporters in later life. Partnerless older adults—particularly never married—were more likely to receive practical help from siblings than those with partners. While childlessness alone did not increase sibling support, kinless older adults received the highest levels of help. Kinless individuals also provided more assistance and personal care to siblings, even across long distances. Geographic proximity strengthened support exchanges, but kinlessness remained a strong predictor of support exchange regardless of distance. Finally, a 10 km threshold seems adequate for approximating help and care exchanges between siblings.

Drawing on original personal network data from the highly polarized context of Catalonia, Spain (65 citizens reporting on 663 social relationships), we compare discussion partner selection across three topics: general politics, Catalan independence (high polarization), and climate change (low polarization). We examine: (1) the extent to which political and non-political interpersonal factors facilitate or inhibit political discussion, and (2) whether their influence varies by issue polarization. Contrasting previous findings, our results reveal that opinion similarity is the strongest predictor of discussion partner selection across all topics, even when controlling for interaction opportunities, highlighting the role of purposeful partner selection. Selection on non-political factors such as tie strength, structural proximity, and socio-demographic similarity also occurs, but their influence varies depending on the issue being discussed.

Results showed a moderate positive correlation (ρ = 0.60), suggesting that organizations serving communities with higher perceived food insecurity also reported more frequent hospitalizations among people with SCD. While limited by a small sample size and reliance on organizational perceptions rather than patient-level data, these exploratory findings highlight food insecurity as a potentially important, and often overlooked, factor in SCD-related health outcomes. Advocacy organizations may offer valuable, context-specific insights into how social and structural determinants shape hospitalization patterns. Larger, multi-level studies that integrate organizational, clinical, and patient-reported data are needed to clarify causal pathways and to inform interventions aimed at reducing preventable hospitalizations among people living with SCD.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8jhzt_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8jhzt_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014865174680446902}, {"title": "Structured audit trail for making the rigor in qualitative research explicit: a methodological tutorial", "authors": "Bea Mertens, Sven De Maeyer, Vincent Donche", "abstract": "As an answer to the question of what open science principles could look like in qualitative research, this methodological tutorial introduces a structured audit trail format tailored to the specific needs of qualitative research.

Building on the clean slate principle from Business Process Reengineering, SHR calls for a categorical reset—discarding entrenched, fragmented, and quasi-holistic perspectives that have dominated social science and economic discourse. The analysis synthesizes six key concepts: holism, narrative synthesis, systems thinking, organizational advantages, and a redefinition of the Global Economic System (GES) as the Redefined GES (RGES). SHR challenges legacy frameworks, highlighting how disciplinary boundaries and reductionist traditions foster unresolved discrepancies, inefficiencies, and systemic risks spanning environmental, financial, and geopolitical arenas.

This approach exposes the root causes of global fragmentation and proposes a holistic basis for sustainable solutions, emphasizing connectivity and multidimensional synergy across processes and disciplines. The urgency of SHR arises from accelerating environmental challenges, increasing information overload, and persistent institutional failures.

Utilizing the YouTube API and natural language processing techniques, the VPI measures public references to violence in 3,398,143 geolocated videos across Mexico (2020–2024). This approach provides spatiotemporally granular data on violence perceptions, extending beyond traditional event-based datasets by capturing not only documented violence but also rumors, fears, and community discourse about violence—dimensions that influence community behavior and social stability independently of official records. Violence scores are constructed using a weighted Spanish-language dictionary developed through semantic network expansion from violence-related seed terms. The dictionary-based scoring approach demonstrates moderate-to-substantial agreement with large language model classifications across 700 stratified comments (75-81% agreement), validating the method's capacity to systematically identify violence-related discourse at scale while maintaining computational efficiency for processing millions of comments. The VPI is benchmarked against established violence indicators including ACLED fatalities and official municipal homicide statistics through panel regression specifications incorporating comprehensive spatial and temporal fixed effects. Analysis reveals systematic geographic heterogeneity: the VPI correlates strongly with ACLED data in high-population areas but exhibits stronger correlation with official homicide records in low-population contexts. Rather than constituting a methodological limitation, this pattern demonstrates the VPI's enhanced sensitivity in marginalized and remote regions where news-based datasets suffer from systematic reporting bias.

Profit-oriented incentives, revolving-door politics, and misaligned academic reward systems have collectively undermined transparency and accountability. The COVID-19 pandemic magnified these longstanding weaknesses, exposing how institutional opacity and commercial influence can distort evidence, policy, and ultimately, public confidence. Main body: This narrative review synthesizes multidisciplinary evidence from peer-reviewed literature, national surveys, regulatory audits, and governmental investigations to identify systemic determinants of declining trust in medical science. Three domains were examined: (1) commercial practices within the pharmaceutical industry that prioritize shareholder value over patient outcomes; (2) regulatory frameworks compromised by lobbying, capture, and outdated oversight models; and (3) academic systems distorted by publication bias, funding pressures, and privatization of publicly financed discoveries. From this synthesis, a six-point roadmap is proposed to restore institutional credibility, grounded in the principles of transparency, ethics, and accountability. The framework includes independent oversight bodies, reformed approval pathways, enforceable conflict-of-interest standards, equitable funding distribution, open-access academic infrastructures, and a centralized public feedback architecture. Collectively, these measures aim to recalibrate the social contract between science and society, ensuring that biomedical progress is both ethically grounded and publicly accountable. Conclusion: Restoring trust in medical science requires more than countering misinformation. It demands structural transformation. By embedding transparency into corporate, regulatory, and academic governance, and by aligning scientific enterprise with the public interest rather than private gain, medical science can reclaim its moral authority.

The Targeted Interception Theory of Behaviour Change offers a framework for improving effectiveness by aligning intervention strategies with the cognitive characteristics of behaviours, conceptualised along a continuum from habitual to scripted to considered behaviours. Across three studies, we empirically test key assumptions of this theory. Study 1 classified 18 pro-environmental behaviours based on self-reported mental processing, identifying four focal behaviours that span the continuum: purchasing energy-efficient white goods (considered), setting heating sustainably (scripted), choosing vegetarian/vegan meals at restaurants (semi-habitual), and purchasing carbon offsets with flights (highly habitual). Study 2 comprised four survey experiments comparing cognitive interventions (environmental messaging), behavioural-guidance interventions, and choice architecture changes (default change) against a control condition. While Study 1 confirmed that behaviours differ in cognitive demands, results from Study 2 were mixed: default changes increased intentions to purchase energy-efficient white goods and to choose vegetarian/vegan meals, whereas other interventions rarely outperformed the control. Study 3 reanalysed meta-analytic data from 137 field interventions, coding each by behaviour type (habitual or scripted) and intervention strategy (cognitive, behavioural-guidance, or choice architecture). These results supported theoretical predictions: choice architecture interventions were effective across both behaviour types; behavioural-guidance interventions were moderately effective for scripted behaviours but ineffective for habitual behaviours; and cognitive interventions had negligible impact.

Yet little guidance exists on how to select measures that are both theoretically robust and practically usable, and many researchers and practitioners remain unaware of the implications, biases, and consequences of their methodological choices. This paper proposes an analytical framework that consolidates dispersed arguments in the literature into a single, structured reference for evaluating accessibility measures. Developed through a comprehensive review and validated by an international expert survey, the framework comprises thirteen criteria—ten theoretical and three practical. It clarifies the ideal conditions for assessing TRSE, the trade-offs between theoretical rigor and practical feasibility, and the biases that arise from different methodological decisions. Rather than prescribing a single ideal measure, the framework makes explicit the assumptions, strengths, and limitations underlying different approaches, supporting more transparent and context-sensitive TRSE evaluations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9rsgu_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/9rsgu_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.030038930955699206}, {"title": "The ESG Resonance Model (ESGRM): Conceptualising Communication Fatigue and Organisational Burnout within Sustainable Strategy", "authors": "Thejan Anil", "abstract": "The ESG Resonance Model (ESGRM) conceptualises how organisational communication, employee psychology, and stakeholder perception interact within the ESG landscape. It argues that stakeholder fatigue and organisational burnout are interconnected outcomes of communicative overload and misalignment between intent and action. Building on burnout theory (Maslach &amp; Leiter, 1997) and the Job Demands–Resources framework (Demerouti et al., 2001), ESGRM integrates five domains—signal quality, signal intensity, alignment, assurance, and employee sense-making—within a quarterly feedback loop. The model proposes that when communication clarity and internal coherence are high, resonance strengthens, fostering trust and authenticity. Conversely, excessive signalling without alignment accelerates fatigue and erodes legitimacy. ESGRM thus functions as both a diagnostic and corrective framework, guiding organisations to evaluate and refine their communicative balance. Though conceptual in nature, it provides a foundation for future empirical testing through sentiment analysis and longitudinal feedback, positioning ESGRM as a dynamic bridge between communication theory and sustainable organisational strategy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hquka_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/hquka_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014509897317509401}, {"title": "READ THE DAMN DOCUMENTATION (CAREFULLY).

We all know we should. But – let’s be honest – it’s a lot more fun to just start playing with the data. This can however be a dangerous game to play. This paper presents a case study of this matter using the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). A survey question included in this study attempts to measure student truancy across countries over time. The international survey documentation suggests an identical question has been used across countries and cycles. Yet the national documentation illustrates how a subtle – yet important – change to the wording was made in some countries in 2015. We demonstrate how researchers could easily miss this change and how this would impact inferences in changes in truancy rates before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Attempts to use artificial intelligence and large language models to spot this problem resulted in overconfidently incorrect advice.

Cummings-Koether", "abstract": "The swift integration of artificial intelligence and large language models into daily work is changing how humans solve problems. Following Wave 1, which identified context-dependent ethics and fragile trust, this paper shares intermediate results from Wave 2 of a multinational longitudinal study. A diverse sample of 36 people completed a comprehensive survey and four graded problem vignettes. This captured their demographics, AI proficiency, usage patterns, ethical perceptions, verification capabilities, and performance. Findings point to a consolidating hybrid problem-solving culture. This culture uses a structured process where after an initial human framing, AI is strategically embedded for tasks including research at 72.2 percent, checking correctness at 69.4 percent, ideation at 61.1 percent, and formulation at 61.1 percent. Consultation with AI increases as tasks become more complex, rising from 11.1 percent on a simple task to 48.1 percent on a complex probability task and 44.0 percent on an optimization task. However, actual performance declines with this complexity, as accuracy drops from 90.3 percent to 46.7 percent. Two systematic gaps also widen with complexity. One is a belief-performance gap where perceived correctness exceeds actual accuracy by 34.6 percentage points on the most complex tasks. The other is a proof-belief gap where verification capability lags behind confidence by 17.7 percentage points. Together with Wave 1, these results indicate a shift toward distributed human-AI cognition that is accompanied by verification deficits. We outline planned Wave 3 interventions including verification scaffolds, trust-calibration training, and task-specific proof requirements.

Social media platforms may serve as modern public spheres, offering spaces for publics to engage in rational and critical discourse. The affordances of social media platforms are crucial in providing such opportunities for dialogue and exchange. In the broader context of mediatization, we examine how platform socio-technological affordances, such as anonymity, reward systems, and moderation guidelines, coupled with user practices, co-shape the way information is produced, framed, and consumed within online communities. This study employs digital ethnography as a method to observe selected subreddits and interviews with their users, focusing on their experiences and perceptions of these digital spaces. Our preliminary findings indicate that, alongside external influences, inherent tensions between social and technological mechanisms simultaneously hinder and contribute to the nature of online deliberation, highlighting fundamental ambivalence as a structural element of online deliberative spaces.

This commentary brings together such evidence from outside psychology: quasi-experimental studies of military conscription, longitudinal research on fraternity hazing, and new archival work on When Prophecy Fails and other prophetic movements. Across democratic, authoritarian, and small-group settings, coerced or effortful participation fails to generate the attitudinal justification predicted by induced compliance.

Methodologically, we turn a large-scale bibliometric dataset (Scopus raw data) into a comprehensive, longitudinal data source for research on careers in science. The global science system is highly immobile: half of global top performers continue their careers as top performers and one-third of global bottom performers as bottom performers. Jumpers-Up and Droppers-Down are extremely rare in science. The chances of moving radically up or down in productivity classes are marginal (1% or less).

AI urbanism, in particular, manifests the current climax of the long-standing desire to control digital technology in the city yet to come. An excessive focus on technology, however, risks de-contextualising it from the wider economic and political landscapes. While digital platforms have been structuring the fabric of daily urban life colonising almost any field of interest through their ecosystems and mobile apps, AI technologies start making their way into cities with: autonomous vehicles, city brains, Digital Twins and robotics. Advocates suggest these novel technologies have changed the geographies of their deployment – not confined to cities any more, rather on regional or global scales – and of their partnerships with city management – cities no longer having exclusive and central stage, rather participating to consortia with limited or secondary roles. Both these configurations have been framed as the ‘post-smart city’. But, is there a paradigm shift between these versions of urbanism? Has the ‘smart city’ framework – the neoliberal project of linking private investment from technology firms into the management and governance of city living – substantially changed? And, finally, what role is expected for cities to take in this uncertain and evolving scenario? The ‘data-driven city’ ought to be understood in pair with the development of data capitalism and the enormous expansion of its data infrastructure, markets and services. Thus, I invite to re-position this debate as an intensification of neoliberal (‘smart’ or ‘data-driven’) urbanism and its ideological assumptions: technological solutionism and smart mentality, and data extractivism, surveillance and control.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zutpa_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zutpa_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013461149780469084}]
