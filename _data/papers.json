To gain insight into what kind of arguments parties present to the public, and under what conditions, we develop a model of argumentation where parties compete to persuade voters before engaging in platform competition. Our model allows us to explore when parties present arguments that highlight the strengths of their ideological positions, as opposed to those that expose the weaknesses of their opponents'; when parties try to persuade voters on the same or on different dimensions; and when parties tacitly collude on an dimension, neither truly attempting to change voters' preferences.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12983","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12983","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4286,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Legislative Cooptation in Authoritarian Regimes: Policy Cooperation in the Kuwait National Assembly","authors":"Daniel L. Tavana, Erin York","abstract":"This article examines how authoritarian regimes use legislative institutions to coopt rival elites and induce policy cooperation. Theories of cooptation under authoritarianism emphasize two mechanisms: economic rents and policy concessions. Despite the persistence of these mechanisms in the literature, evidence of their effect on policy outcomes remains limited. In this paper, we develop a theory of legislative cooptation, or the intentional exchange of economic rents and policy concessions to legislators in exchange for policy cooperation. We test our theory using a novel dataset of 150,000 roll-call votes from the Kuwait National Assembly that spans the entirety of Kuwait’s legislative history. We leverage the regime’s participation in the legislature to establish a measure of legislative cooperation and use this measure to estimate the efficacy of mechanisms of cooptation in inducing conformity with its policy agenda. Both mechanisms effectively elicit cooperation: but they have different strategic and normative implications for our understanding of how representation emerges in non-democratic contexts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123424000371","doi":"10.1017/s0007123424000371","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.449,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Workplace Networks and Political Selection","authors":"Linuz Aggeborn, Henrik Andersson","abstract":"Do social networks at workplaces function as cues into the political arena? We consider this question using the case of Sweden, which has many leisure politicians who work in the regular labour market.

We further find that these newly enrolled individuals are placed higher up on the party lists – which to a very large extent dictates which party nominees are elected – in subsequent elections. Our mechanism analysis indicates that the effect is stronger if we consider political party bloc networks and that high-ability party officials are more prominent than low-ability officials in terms of recruiting from their workplace networks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425000067","doi":"10.1017/s0007123425000067","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4528,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Anti-Asian Hate Crimes and American Reputation","authors":"Joonseok Yang, Sung Eun Kim, Jong Hee Park, Inbok Rhee","abstract":"Racial hate crimes against Asian Americans in the USA have recently risen.

We analyse data from Understanding Society to test whether there is such a gender gap among the five main ethnic minority groups with high levels of electoral eligibility and participation. We show that there is a positive gender gap with women in Pakistani and Bangladeshi ethnic groups more likely to support Labour than the Conservatives, but that there is not a gender gap among other ethnic minority groups.

We leverage the surprise news of Brazil’s historic 2015 corruption scandal, which broke during Latinobarometer data collection, to assess the causal effects of scandals on political system support. From the corruption literature, we derive and test two hypotheses: (1) a conditional hypothesis in which the public rewards democratic institutions for uncovering corruption and punishes those institutions implicated in the scandal, and (2) a cynical hypothesis in which the public punishes democratic institutions as complicit or failing to prevent corruption. Our regression discontinuity analysis finds support for the cynical hypothesis. Being randomly sampled after the news of the scandal broke leads to a significant reduction in trust in institutions, whether they were involved in the scandal or not, in democratic values, and in support for democracy. We conclude with the implications of these findings for accountability and challenges to democracy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251342918","doi":"10.1177/00104140251342918","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.4493,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do second-order elections produce second-order governments?

MEIJERS, ROBERT A. HUBER, ANDREJ ZASLOVE","abstract":"Populist ideology centres around a supposed clash between the ‘honest and upright people’ and the ‘evil and corrupted elite’. Yet, which groups are perceived to constitute ‘the people’ and ‘the elite’ likely varies across parties. This research note investigates which factors explain how inclusive or exclusive the conceptions of these two core groups are. Why do some parties define the people in cultural terms, whereas others rely on economic considerations? And why do some parties consider CEOs as elites, whilst others consider academics as elites? We argue that parties’ degree of populism in combination with their ideological orientation allow us to understand these dynamics. In order to investigate these questions systematically, a new wave of the Populism and Political Parties Expert Survey (POPPA) was collected in 2023. Covering 312 political parties in 31 European countries in 2023, a novel module allows us to understand how parties define ‘the people’ and ‘elites’. We find that parties' populism and host ideology are important drivers of their people/elite conceptions. The higher a party's level of populism the more exclusionary its conception of the people is. Nativism is, moreover, associated with the exclusion of societal groups on cultural grounds, while left‐wing economic ideology drives the exclusion of societal groups on economic grounds. With respect to elites, populism is the most important determinant for parties' conceptions of the elite. By contrast, party ideology plays a subordinate role in parties' elite conceptions. This investigation has important implications for our understanding of populist parties, what the nature of their populist appeal is, and how they seek to mobilize in the political arena.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.70026","doi":"10.1111/1475-6765.70026","journal_full":"European Journal of Political Research","dist":0.5247,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Lost in Transmission: Bureaucracy, Noise, and Communication in International Politics","authors":"Don Casler, Tyler Jost","abstract":"Effective communications are often the difference between whether states go to war or remain at peace. Yet decision-makers in one state frequently fail to understand what decision-makers in another are trying to say. Under what conditions do international communications fail? We argue that division of labor within government can degrade international communication by introducing transmission noise, which occurs when bureaucracies dispatch signals to foreign countries that deviate from the leader's intended meaning. The structure of bureaucratic institutions—the formal and informal rules and procedures defining how leaders and bureaucrats interact—affects the severity of transmission noise. Open institutions reduce transmission noise by improving information-sharing between leaders and bureaucrats; closed institutions increase transmission noise by impeding information-sharing and bureaucratic oversight. In short, patterns of communication within states shape communication effectiveness between states. We evaluate the theory by analyzing bureaucratic signaling processes before and after institutional reforms in India in the mid-1960s. For the cases on India's negotiations with China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965, we leverage sources from six countries to illustrate how sender-side institutions can degrade communication. The theory and findings emphasize the important but relatively overlooked roles that transmission noise and bureaucracy play in international communication.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00511","doi":"10.1162/isec_a_00511","journal_full":"International Security","dist":0.4648,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Monks Behaving Badly: Explaining Buddhist Violence in Asia","authors":"Nilay Saiya, Stuti Manchanda","abstract":"The dramatic rise in religious violence across the globe since the end of the Cold War has motivated scholars to try to explain violent religion-related extremism.

Of the world's major faith traditions, Buddhism is most commonly and widely associated with peace, tolerance, and compassion. Yet Buddhism, like every other great religion, has a violent side. While scholars acknowledge violence within Buddhism, few have explored why Buddhism becomes violent in some places but not others. We develop a structural explanation for Buddhist violence. Our central claim is that Buddhist violence tends to occur in countries where Buddhism and the state are closely intertwined. We test this theory using both a statistical analysis of Buddhist violence in Buddhist-majority and Buddhist-plural countries and case studies of Buddhist violence (or lack thereof) in Myanmar, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Our findings show that religion-state integration emboldens Buddhist vigilantes to attack religious minorities.

Walt","abstract":"Regional hegemony is a realist concept explaining how great powers deal with each other and with their immediate surroundings. Realism's competing strands disagree on whether regional hegemony is a feasible objective, and on whether states should actively pursue this goal. For offensive realists, the international system's anarchic structure and the impossibility of gauging others' intentions compel states to maximize relative power and try to become the only great power in their region. They predict that a great power war is more likely because China will try to establish hegemony in Asia and the United States will try to prevent it from doing so. By contrast, defensive realists maintain that bids for hegemony are usually thwarted by powerful balancing coalitions. Defensive realists have the stronger case: In modern times, the United States is the only great power whose bid for hegemony was not thwarted by a powerful balancing coalition. The United States succeeded because conditions in North America were unusually favorable; China does not enjoy similar advantages. A Chinese bid for hegemony in Asia is likely to fail and Beijing would be unwise to attempt it. U.S. leaders can therefore adopt a measured approach to this danger, facilitating balancing behavior by the United States' Asian partners while working with China to create a more stable regional order.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00508","doi":"10.1162/isec_a_00508","journal_full":"International Security","dist":0.3337,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The U.S.-China Military Balance in Space","authors":"Zachary Burdette","abstract":"How will the U.S. military's growing use of space to support its operations and the growing counterspace capabilities available to its rivals shape the balance of power?

My central claim is that war is the dominant feature of life in the international system, mainly because of the nature of politics. In particular, politics is a fundamentally conflictual enterprise with the ever-present possibility of violence in the background. This argument, which differs from Carl von Clausewitz's famous claim that war is an extension of politics by other means, is rarely made in the international relations literature. I examine how the interplay between politics and war affects how states both initiate and conduct armed conflict. What are the limits on states starting wars, and how do political and military factors contribute to their escalation?

Incompatibilities over government involve organizations making maximalist claims related to the legitimacy of elections, the composition of the national government, or regime change. GIDP 2.0 includes information about which of these claims is present in each incompatibility year. These data can facilitate analyses of the onset, dynamics, and outcomes of both civil war and nonviolent campaigns, improve our ability to predict their occurrence, and allow for analysis of whether international efforts to prevent violent conflicts over government are effective. We present a series of descriptive analyses showing that governmental incompatibilities are common but not ubiquitous, and occur across time periods, and within and across regime types. These descriptive analyses further show interesting variation among the types of claims articulated in democracies, autocracies, and anocracies and across different types of autocratic institutions. A brief two-stage analysis shows that some factors commonly included in studies of armed conflict and nonviolent campaign onset have different effects on the emergence of governmental incompatibilities and on whether these incompatibilities escalate to mass mobilization.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqaf037","doi":"10.1093/isq/sqaf037","journal_full":"International Studies Quarterly","dist":0.4798,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Selling Violent Extremism","authors":"Danny Klinenberg","abstract":"Why do people join domestic violent extremist organizations?

A key question for policymakers and peace builders, then, is how interventions into situations of low social capital might resolve persistent interpersonal conflicts sustained through complex networks of interaction. Existing approaches to this question generally focus on the small-scale effects of interventions like peace education that seek to change the attitudes of a few individuals at a time. Less focus has been paid to how such programs could leverage social networks to have broader effects on society as a whole. This paper explores this scale effect by building a conceptual agent-based model of conflict resolution and cooperation to examine when new ideas introduced by peace builders might spread throughout a population. We find significant benefits to layering different kinds of programs on the same populations, with the goal of leveraging the structure of society to maximize intervention impact.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027251338841","doi":"10.1177/00220027251338841","journal_full":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","dist":0.5093,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Effect of Reciprocity on Trust: International Cooperation and COVID Aid","authors":"Andrew Roskos-Ewoldsen, Morgan Ellithorpe, Brandon J Kinne","abstract":"Reciprocity is a well-known influence on international cooperation.

In an experimental survey of US adults, we test the roles of exposure to between-country reciprocity, perceived similarity, and costliness on trust toward a counterpart country, using the context of cooperation during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Existing literature has highlighted the intricate indirect pathways that can lead to increasing conflicts following a climatic shock, including reduced agricultural yields, increased food insecurity, and other socio-economic channels that are highly context-specific as well as difficult to quantify. This study investigates the nexus between climate variability (proxied by temperature anomalies) and violent conflicts as mediated by child acute malnutrition in Nigeria. Starting from previous quantitative analyses that implicitly assumed the existence of a singular transmission pathway linking climate variability to conflict, this study employs a structural equation model that accommodates the presence of multiple, albeit unobserved, mediating factors. In doing so, it pioneers the use of children’s nutritional indicators as mediating factors to capture the multidimensional nature of the climate–conflict relationship. The novel approach proposed for this analysis increases the accuracy of estimating the indirect impacts of climate variability on conflict, as mediated by child nutritional outcomes, and contributes to the literature linked to the humanitarian, development and peace nexus.

Similarly, they are more inclined to use negative group-based appeals.

This article draws on a global survey of international relations (IR) scholars ( N = 820) to analyze the cognitive dimensions underlying research quality evaluation and their variation across sociological and epistemological factors. We identify seven distinct quality factors: theoretical significance, logical style and structure, practical significance, methodological rigor, contribution and value for future research, interest and topicality, and challenge to existing knowledge. Our results suggest that, while personal preferences, disciplinary norms, and professional practices—shaped by variables such as gender, nationality, and political orientation—influence evaluations, research quality judgments are ultimately grounded in shared cognitive frameworks. Our study offers robust evidence that quality assessments, though subject to sociological variation, reflect deeper, common cognitive structures across scholarly communities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592724002676","doi":"10.1017/s1537592724002676","journal_full":"Perspectives on Politics","dist":0.4686,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gendered Perceptions of Legislative Influence","authors":"Jaclyn Kaslovsky, Tabitha Koch, Michael P.

Yet, little previous scholarship has quantitatively examined whether legislative insiders are biased against women and their accomplishments. We explore a new potential explanation for gender inequity in legislatures: that women in office may get less credit than men for similar achievements. If legislative insiders systematically undervalue women’s work, women will have a harder time gaining influence within the chamber; alternatively, those working in and with the legislature may be uniquely aware of the effort that goes into representational activities and can observe the work that women perform firsthand. To examine this question, we combine elite evaluations of legislators from the North Carolina General Assembly with data on committee assignments, legislative effectiveness, electoral performance, and more. We find little systematic evidence that women legislators’ accomplishments are valued less than those of the men with whom they serve.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725000477","doi":"10.1017/s1537592725000477","journal_full":"Perspectives on Politics","dist":0.4151,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Green colonialism or green transformation?

Phillips, Florian Stoeckel","abstract":"Since the Brexit referendum, two novel political identities, Leaver and Remainer, have gained political salience in the United Kingdom. Some work contends that Leavers and Remainers display great animus toward one another in ways similar to affective polarization (dislike of opposing partisans). However, it remains unclear whether the dislike is as deep as partisan affective polarization and whether these identities are still relevant several years after Brexit. Additionally, it is not known whether Brexit‐related animus is based more on in‐group favoritism or out‐group dislike. Using a survey experiment paradigm to assess different levels of prejudice (based on pre‐registered hypotheses), we find clear prejudice based on Brexit identity in 2019 that is almost unchanged in 2023. Both in‐group favoritism and out‐group animus appear to drive these tendencies, but out‐group animus's effects are more robust. Leavers and Remainers have different motivations for different manifestations of prejudice, but each displays both tendencies at times.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70037","doi":"10.1111/pops.70037","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.585,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Bridging the divide: Understanding the psychological factors influencing feminist women's support to transgender related policies","authors":"Danna Galván‐Hernández, Lucía Estevan‐Reina, Ángel del Fresno‐Díaz, Finn Frohn, Stephen Wright, Soledad de Lemus","abstract":"The demand for trans people's institutional rights and the approval of the Trans Law (Law 04/3023) has polarized the feminist movement in Spain. In this contentious context, our studies examined the relationship between feminist identity and support for, or opposition to, trans rights among the University community. Two correlational studies (Study 1a = 317; Study 1b = 323) conducted before the law's passage provided opposing results regarding the association between feminist identity and support for trans rights. Building upon these findings, two experimental studies (Study 2 N = 415; Study 3 N = 405) exposed ciswomen to cooperation or conflict narratives and examined their impact on reactive threat, zero‐sum beliefs, and support for pro‐trans or anti‐trans collective actions. Conflict narratives increased reactive threat and zero‐sum beliefs, leading to more anti‐trans and fewer pro‐trans actions. Additionally, a direct positive link was observed between feminist identification and support for pro‐trans actions, while a negative association was found with reactionary actions (opposite for ideological threat). Based on these findings, we propose a series of win‐win strategies to support trans rights and promote peacebuilding and inclusivity in Spanish universities without triggering threat or zero‐sum beliefs in ciswomen.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70032","doi":"10.1111/pops.70032","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.5603,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Survey sampling in the Global South using Facebook advertisements – CORRIGENDUM","authors":"Leah R.

A simple decomposition strategy is proposed for distinguishing between these policymaking mechanisms on income inequality in the American states from 1986 to 2020.

The statistical evidence, for the most part, that income inequality observed in the American states is generally unaffected by both TELs and partisan control of state governments—the lone exception being unified Republican state governments operating under a TEL.

Yet recent studies find that historically disadvantaged racial minorities often espouse more progressive political views as Christian nationalism increases. Building on an understanding that American religion and politics are fundamentally racialized and drawing on nationally representative data from a nonprobability sample with a Christian nationalism scale incorporating ideology and self-identification, we examine how racial identity moderates the link between Christian nationalism and how much Americans identify with the terms “woke” and “progressive.” Results reveal racial divergence. As Christian nationalism increases, White Americans are either no different or less likely to affirm progressive identities, while Black Americans become more likely to identify as “woke,” and both Black and Hispanic Americans become more likely to identify as “progressive.” Patterns are also consistent across partisan identity. Results further affirm how race moderates Christian nationalist views and demonstrate how endorsing progressive identities is differentially shaped by race and religion.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf009","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf009","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5069,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Voice and Value: How Elected Officials Evaluate Online and Offline Constituent Feedback","authors":"Nathan Lee, Kaiping Chen, William Marble, Curtis Bram","abstract":"Social media has made it easier than ever for citizens to voice their opinion to their elected representatives. However, officials may infer that constituents who write to them via low-effort online mediums care less about the issues than those who communicate in person. To test how policymakers evaluate messages from constituents, we fielded a national survey of local US policymakers to examine responsiveness to different types of messages. Our findings indicate that online communication presents a double-edged sword: while it lowers the effort needed for constituents to communicate, officials discount information conveyed through social media. We examine this trade-off using an embedded conjoint experiment. Our results suggest that a social media message would have to be sent by more than 47 constituents for it to exceed the value of a single face-to-face meeting. These findings illustrate that, all else equal, in-person meetings likely remain the most persuasive form of grassroots communication. However, using social media can be an effective choice to the extent that it facilitates a large increase in overall levels of constituent engagement.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf006","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf006","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4659,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Effects of Forecasts on the Accuracy and Precision of Expectations","authors":"Matthew Barnfield, Joseph Phillips, Florian Stoeckel, Benjamin Lyons, Paula Szewach, Jack Thompson, Vittorio Mérola, Sabrina Stöckli, Jason Reifler","abstract":"Quantitative forecasts have become increasingly prominent as tools for aiding public understanding of sociopolitical trends.

The direction of that effect hinges on how the forecast is presented. Voters become more accurate and precise in their predictions of each candidate’s vote share when given forecast information in the form of projected vote share.

We investigate the degree to which observed partisan bias in fact-opinion discernment is due to expressive responding: partisans may claim that congenial opinions are facts, and that uncongenial facts are opinions, because they want to express their partisan attitude toward the statement. Four experiments (total N = 10,614) show that expressive responding substantially inflates measured partisan differences in fact/opinion classifications, by more than 50 percent in the United States and about 30 percent in Israel. Despite this, we find little evidence that our treatments increased the proportion of correct classifications. In other words, although expressive responding makes people look more partisan than they really are, it does not lead surveys to underestimate the average person’s ability to distinguish fact from opinion. These results are compatible because of a rarely noted implication of expressive responding theory: when the correct answer is party congenial, expressive responding makes people look more competent than they really are. Notably, expressive responding emerged despite the survey instrument’s instructions not to respond in this manner. This suggests that approaches that rely on instructions or requests may be too weak to eliminate expressive responding.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf008","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf008","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4805,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Michael A.

Taking advantage of new regulations and demand from streaming services for localized production in Europe, U.S.-based private equity firms started purchasing local film and television production companies and concentrating power in regional production conglomerates. A simple “follow the money” approach to this phenomenon might over-assign ownership and thereby operational control to these financial stakeholders. However, a more holistic approach to following the money, which offers a plastic and relational ecology with different axes of power between different stakeholders for a given television production, complicates our understanding of private equity in transnational television. This article examines the transnational financial ecology of one of these private equity firms’ regional production conglomerates (KKR’s Leonine Studios) and the capital threads connected to one of its programs ( Pagan Peak ). Relying on publicly available industry deep texts and background interviews with television professionals, this case study presents the paradoxical opportunities that private equity capital specifically and television investment generally offer at the same time that they can exploit, concentrate, and extract.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251341232","doi":"10.1177/01634437251341232","journal_full":"Media, Culture & Society","dist":0.3586,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Tethered labor: Creation and coercion in the platform economy","authors":"Fan Liang","abstract":"This study examines the relationship between content creators and multi-channel networks (MCNs) in China’s platform economy through the lens of labor coercion.

Drawing on lawsuit documents and in-depth interviews with creators, this study introduces the concept of “tethered labor” to examine the tension between creation and coercion across three key dimensions: dependency, de-flexibilization, and resilience. The findings reveal that creators are heavily reliant on MCNs for content production and monetization, often involuntarily due to the threat of MCNs’ punitive power. This dependency enables MCNs to exert substantial control over creators, making creation increasingly de-flexible. However, creators develop tactics to navigate such coercion, and the ongoing struggle has the potential to destabilize MCNs. The results demonstrate that tethered labor constrains the autonomy and flexibility traditionally associated with creative work.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251341231","doi":"10.1177/01634437251341231","journal_full":"Media, Culture & Society","dist":0.3882,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Listening, Race, Partisanship, and Politics: How Socio-Demographics, Conversational Topics, and Dyadic Properties Affect Listening","authors":"William P.

Amid ongoing battlefield stalemates that have prolonged the war, this initiative has evolved into a broader form of resistance, staging distant witnessing through X postings to circumvent the party-state’s internet censorship. As this process unfolds, activists capitalize on social media affordances to curate witness testimonies that counter China’s distorted geopolitical narratives and beyond.

Our results show three significant instances that influence the odds of monitoring a romantic partner: (1) past experiences with digital abuse, (2) past experiences with offline psychological abuse, and (3) age, with younger women having increased odds of engaging in digital monitoring compared to older women. Although relationship satisfaction was negatively associated with digital monitoring, it was not a predictor variable. This suggests that casual surveillance behaviors are highly ambiguous and not necessarily indicative of a poor relationship. In fact, for women with past abuse experiences, digital monitoring may function as a coping mechanism that brings personal reassurance.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251337352","doi":"10.1177/20563051251337352","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4448,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Digitalization and economic growth in the MENA region: Evidence from panel data analysis","authors":"Touitou Mohammed, Laib Yacine","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102992","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102992","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.3607,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Counteracting Narratives: Evidence from An Online Experiment","authors":"Manwei Liu, Sili Zhang","abstract":"Can people counteract biased narratives with subsequent information? Using an online experiment where counteracting may have the best odds by design, we investigate this question by first randomly assigning subjects to read different narratives that contain the same facts, and then offering them the opportunity to acquire and process balanced arguments. We document three main findings. First, subjects shift their attitudes towards the standpoint of the randomly assigned narrative, knowing that the narrative is slanted and randomly assigned. Second, the opportunity to read additional arguments does not prompt subjects to counteract the persuasion effects of the initial narratives. Third, when evaluating subsequent arguments, participants find arguments aligned with the randomly assigned narrative more convincing. These findings remain qualitatively similar in additional treatments where the balanced arguments are provided two weeks after initial exposure to narratives. Only when we replace these arguments with the exact opposing narratives that subjects do not initially see are they able to fully counteract the effects. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of balanced and complete exposure at the outset in counteracting the influence of biased narratives.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf038","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf038","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.5642,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Sweet child of mine: Parental income, child health and inequality","authors":"Nicolas Berman, Lorenzo Rotunno, Roberta Ziparo","abstract":"How to allocate limited resources among children is a crucial household decision, especially in developing countries where it can have strong implications for children and family survival. We provide the first large scale study linking variations in parental income in the early life of children to subsequent child health and parental investments across siblings in developing countries, using data from multiple waves of the Demographic and Health Surveys spanning 54 countries. Variations in the world prices of locally suitable crops are used as measures of local income. We find that children born in periods of higher income receive better health investments and display persistently higher levels of health than their siblings. Children whose siblings were born during favourable income periods receive less investment and exhibit worse health. These findings are consistent with a model of sibling rivalry where parents invest in the child with the highest returns and complementarities in investment across periods. We also provide evidence that other investments (education, parental time use and child labour) react to sibling rivalry. Our results suggest that income shocks can enlarge disparities within households.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf036","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf036","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.4409,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Editors’ introduction","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/epolic/eiaf003","doi":"10.1093/epolic/eiaf003","journal_full":"Economic Policy","dist":0.3383,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Entry, exit, and market structure in a changing climate","authors":"Michele Cascarano, Filippo Natoli, Andrea Petrella","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105027","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105027","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.3338,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Dynamic opinion updating with endogenous networks","authors":"Ugo Bolletta, Paolo Pin","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105045","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105045","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.3507,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Green stocks and monetary policy shocks: Evidence from Europe","authors":"Michael D.

Moreover, if shortages cause patient harm, why don’t markets pay a premium for a reliable supply chain?

First, no measure of the income distribution is truly comprehensive, or could attempt to be comprehensive without making controversial choices. We document the practical and conceptual problems that the standard ideal — comprehensive Haig-Simons income — raises. Second, much of the controversy in this area turns on the many tradeoffs between starting with individual tax data versus more expansive income concepts. Individual tax data reflect only a shrinking subset of a more comprehensive income concept — but they are individual data. More expansive alternatives, on the other hand, are harder to allocate to individuals.

Mortality reductions appear across causes of death and are concentrated in the half of the population with a high school degree or less. We estimate similar percentage reductions in mortality at all ages, with declines in elderly mortality thus responsible for about three-quarters of the total mortality reduction. Recession-induced mortality declines are driven primarily by external effects of reduced aggregate economic activity on mortality, and reduced air pollution appears to be a quantitatively important mechanism.

The results reveal that, on a global scale, passport-related search queries strongly correlate with individuals’ intentions to migrate. However, at the country level, particularly in the global south, migration intentions are more accurately predicted by the adoption rates of Google search rather than search topics per se.

We argue that the prevailing migration discourse in Germany reinforces a one-dimensional political framework, reducing migrants to single-issue subjects—either threats or victims, economic assets or social burdens. This approach to migration falls short of capturing Germany’s evolving socio-political landscape and its changing actors, including queer, feminist, and anti-racist migrant initiatives and cross-generational and multi-ethnic migrant organizations. Adopting an intersectional and postmigrant framework, we explore the dual narrative of increasing structural integration and simultaneously decreasing affective belonging. Here, we are interested in exploring the overlapping contexts of migration and racism in Germany with a perspective that accounts for the experiences of noncitizen migrants, citizen migrants, and nonmigrant racialized citizens. We center our work on the figure of the migrant, not to oversimplify the legal, social, and categorical complexities of this term, but rather to address the social and political conditions of exclusion and marginalization that intersect with race, belonging, and access to rights in Germany. This approach calls for a shift in policy discourse, one that recognizes the intricate interplay of factors shaping migration debates and embraces a postmigrant perspective, viewing migration as a dynamic, multilinear process that drives broader societal transformation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00444-0","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00444-0","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5897,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Living together (and apart) on the move: new directions in everyday multiculturalism","authors":"Katy Bennett, Stef De Sabbata, Zoe Gardner","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2499541","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2499541","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.51,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Black girls and how we fail them","authors":"Chelsey Adams","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2501133","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2501133","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.2581,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Foreign in two homelands: racism, return migration, and Turkish-German history","authors":"Bahar Baser","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2501119","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2501119","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.5039,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Racialised perspectives on inequality: a qualitative exploration into cultural knowledge structures among Malaysian minorities","authors":"Kristy Chong Ching Yee, Liz Jones","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2493938","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2493938","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.4655,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"“I do not have enough religion to change it”.

We address these by examining Latino party identification over a 34-year period, leveraging 35 national surveys with a total of over 103,000 Latino respondents along with Census data to create post-stratified survey weights to correct for biases. We emphasize changing partisanship over time by nativity, birth cohorts, and by national origin. From 2000 to 2012, we observed a slight overall increase in Democratic identification and a decrease in Republican identification, but this was driven by foreign-born Latinos. After 2012, we see declining Democratic identification overall, greater Republican identification among foreign-born and older native-born Latinos, and accelerating Independent identification among native-born Millennial and Gen Z Latinos. These results show that generational turnover and differences by nativity challenge extant theories of Latino partisan change over time.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.31","doi":"10.1017/rep.2025.31","journal_full":"Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics","dist":0.6012,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Researching and Understanding Far-Right Politics in Times of Mainstreaming","authors":"George Henry Newth, Katy Brown, Aurelien Mondon","abstract":"Contemporary research on far-right politics has relied predominantly on the use of binaries between the ‘far/extreme/(populist) radical right’ and the so-called ‘mainstream’, and a ‘waves’ metaphor to historicise different eras of the post-World War Two far-right.

By reflecting on the current state of the field, summarising dominant approaches and their potential limitations, we arrive at our key contribution: a revised definition of the term ‘far right’ which shifts the focus away from categorisation towards an understanding of far-right politics as a political position. In turn, our approach also presents both a challenge to and evolution of the ‘waves’ metaphor which accounts for processes of mainstreaming and rests on a critical account of the mainstream itself. Our conceptualisation problematises traditional binaries while pointing to a ‘fifth wave’ of far-right politics in which the identities of the mainstream and far right are mutually constitutive. To illustrate our conceptual contribution, we conclude our article with a case study on the interaction between the far right and mainstream in UK politics.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.32","doi":"10.1017/rep.2025.32","journal_full":"Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics","dist":0.4815,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gatekeeping in asylum interviews: institutional bias and narrative inequality in South Korea’s refugee screening process","authors":"Han-Nae Yu","abstract":"This study examines the structural biases and narrative inequalities in South Korea’s refugee screening process, focusing on the concept of gatekeeping. While previous research has concentrated on legal and institutional analyses, this study addresses micro-level dynamics, particularly the asylum interview procedures and interpretation issues. Using testimonies from victims of a 2015–6 fabrication case, where Arabic-speaking asylum seekers’ interview records were falsified, this research reveals that such incidents are rooted not in individual misconduct but in systemic flaws aimed at maintaining low refugee recognition rates and procedural efficiency. The study identifies three key factors undermining the fairness of asylum interviews: institutional bias, asymmetry of linguistic resources, and narrative inequality. By connecting interview-level dynamics to broader bureaucratic and political pressures, this study reveals how gatekeeping produces structural risks of refoulement. Although grounded in South Korea, the findings offer insights into similar patterns across other asylum systems.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf030","doi":"10.1093/jrs/feaf030","journal_full":"Journal of Refugee Studies","dist":0.5055,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The spatial dimensions of migrant politics: to the border and beyond","authors":"Susan Banki, Suraina Pasha","abstract":"This Special Issue examines the interplay between physical space and sociopolitical forces in shaping migrant politics, emphasizing the role of borders as both mechanisms of control and sites of resistance. Moving beyond static geographical boundaries, we conceptualize borders through bordering practices that restrict access to territories, resources, and rights via formal and informal governance mechanisms. These include laws, policies, exclusion zones, and detention systems that create hierarchies between migrants and citizens. While acknowledging these restrictive forces, we argue for a more nuanced understanding of the border that recognizes both migrant agency and political subjectivity in these contested spaces. By bridging critical border studies and migrant politics literature, this Special Issue highlights how migrants challenge state power, despite efforts to immobilize and exclude them. Ultimately, we contend that the border is a deeply political space where struggles over mobility shape both migrant activism and state control.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf028","doi":"10.1093/jrs/feaf028","journal_full":"Journal of Refugee Studies","dist":0.6325,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Refugee Integration Industry: Stakeholder Power, Market Logic, and the (De)Humanisation of Refugee Labour","authors":"Mustafa F.

Drawing on Spender's theory of industrial recipes, we conceptualise the integration industry as a network of public, private and third‐sector actors governed by competing logics of humanitarianism and market efficiency. Through a comparative case study approach based on more than 200 policy, institutional, and civil society sources, we demonstrate how power asymmetries and economic imperatives systematically marginalise refugees' human agency, producing both humanising and dehumanising effects. We introduce a fourfold typology of (de)humanitarianism, indifference, assimilation, integration and multiculturalism models that reveals how different national and organisational contexts mediate the moral, economic, and political tensions at the heart of refugee labour market integration. Despite stark contrasts in governance models and economic capacity, both countries institutionalise forms of exclusion that limit meaningful participation and recognition. Our analysis advances the theoretical understanding of the refugee integration industry as a contested and relational space where policy, discourse and institutional practice interact to shape refugee subjectivities and futures. In doing so, we call for more reflexive, inclusiv, and agency‐centred approaches to integration that foreground social justice and co‐determination.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70043","doi":"10.1002/psp.70043","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.6024,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Non‐Survival to Pension Age in Denmark and Sweden: A Sub‐National Investigation","authors":"Ilya Kashnitsky","abstract":"Mortality keeps improving even in the most developed countries. Deaths before senior age become more and more occasional and thus are increasingly considered unnecessary and perhaps even avoidable. Denmark belongs to the most developed countries of the world in terms of progress in lowering human mortality levels. Yet there is still much room for large improvements—compared to Sweden, the Danish population has almost the same survival profile up to age 50 but then there are striking differences in later ages. Between ages 50 and 65 about 10% of Danish males die while in Sweden this proportion is only about 7%. This paper explores the regularities of non‐survival to pension age across Danish municipalities and compares them to ones in Sweden. The main focus of this exploration is identification of the spatial patterns based on the mortality characteristics of the population that are studied using the advanced spatial clustering algorithm. The methodological challenge resolved along the way is the construction of reliable life table estimates for the small municipal populations. The results suggest that the main reason for the observed gap between Danish and Swedish municipalities, especially for males, is the lagging behind development of the most deprived areas, which corresponds with the results on widening gaps along socioeconomic dimensions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70046","doi":"10.1002/psp.70046","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.4266,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Fertility Differences by Type of Residence Permit Among Female Immigrants in Sweden","authors":"Erik Carlsson","abstract":"Immigrants’ life circumstances both before and after migration are likely to vary considerably by type of residence permit, which may affect fertility behaviour. Yet, the relationship between permit type and fertility is surprisingly underexplored. This study uses Swedish population register data to examine fertility differences by permit type among female immigrants to Sweden. The study also examines variation in fertility patterns within the family migrant category by characteristics of the male partner. The analysis compares how the mean number of children of different groups develops over time, both before and after immigration. The relationship between permit type and fertility is examined separately by geographical origin, to facilitate the disentanglement of permit type and origin effects on immigrant fertility. Results show that the mean number of children is higher among refugees and family migrants than among labour and student migrants. Family migrants experience an increase in fertility tempo shortly after migration, whereas this pattern is less pronounced and often somewhat delayed among labour and student migrants and largely absent among refugees. Among family migrants, women who migrated together with or shortly after their male partner have the highest fertility, whereas family migrants with a Swedish‐born partner have lower fertility than other family migrants. This study contributes new knowledge to the understanding of how permit type relates to fertility, by studying fertility differences between more permit categories than earlier studies, by considering time both before and after migration, and by exploring heterogeneity within the family migrant category.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70045","doi":"10.1002/psp.70045","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5749,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Exploring pathways for world development within planetary boundaries","authors":"Detlef P. van Vuuren, Jonathan C.

We hypothesized that information transfer would deteriorate faster and rapport would be lower in mixed-neurotype compared with single-neurotype chains. Additionally, we examined whether informing participants of the diagnostic status of their chain and whether information was fictional or factual impacted performance and rapport. We found no difference in information transfer between single-neurotype and mixed-neurotype chains. Non-autistic chains indicated higher rapport, and disclosing diagnosis improved rapport. This result challenges assumptions about autistic communication deficits but contrasts with prior findings.

However, whether these strategies can durably reduce partisan animosity in a scalable manner and in everyday life remains unclear. We bridge the gap between prior research and useful application by assessing whether exposure to multiple, scalable treatments that portray inparty and outparty members interacting positively, receiving accurate information about one another’s views, and learning about cross-party similarities can a) durably shift partisans’ sentiments and b) influence partisans’ sentiments toward specific, personally known others encountered in everyday life—not only general, hypothetical, or one-off rival partisans. In a longitudinal survey experiment, we find that exposure to three brief, scalable treatments over a week reduces partisan animosity, with effects persisting for at least a month. Moreover, the treatments durably ameliorate animosity toward both general outparty members and a personally known outparty member, specified prior to the treatments.

Sinclair, Danielle Cosme, Kirsten Lydic, Diego A. Reinero, José Carreras-Tartak, Michael E. Mann, Emily B. Falk","abstract":"Mitigating climate change requires urgent action at individual, collective, and institutional levels. However, individuals may fail to act because they perceive climate change as a threat that is distant or not personally relevant, or believe their actions are not impactful. To address these psychological barriers, we conducted a large-scale “intervention tournament.” In a sample of 7,624 participants, we systematically tested 17 interventions that targeted psychological mechanisms described by three key themes: Relevance, Future Thinking, and Response Efficacy. Interventions that emphasized social relevance were the most effective for motivating people to share news articles and petitions about climate change. Interventions that targeted future thinking were the most effective for broadly motivating individual actions (e.g., driving less, eating vegetarian meals) and collective actions (e.g., donating, volunteering) to address climate change. Interventions that emphasized the environmental impact of these actions reliably increased the perceived impact of pro-environmental actions, but did not consistently motivate action. Notably, interventions that targeted two or more mechanisms—such as imagining a future scenario that involved oneself or close others—were most effective. Importantly, our leading interventions were substantially more effective than prevalent existing strategies (e.g., carbon footprint information). Our findings are relevant to theories of behavior change, motivation, and information sharing, with potential applications across domains. Insights from our tournament could be applied to develop scalable online interventions and mass communication campaigns to address climate change.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426768122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2426768122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4579,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Evidence of a social evaluation penalty for using AI","authors":"Jessica A.

These low levels of reporting may arise either because discriminatory treatment has declined, even while laypeople’s assumptions of widespread discrimination persist, or because it is difficult for individuals to know when they are experiencing discriminatory treatment, leading to underreporting. In investigating this puzzle, we theorized four types of nonsexual workplace experiences that may target women and accumulate to harm well-being, yet may be difficult to recognize as discrimination. To test our predictions, we conducted a longitudinal, multisite experience-sampling study of surgeons, capturing workplace experiences over 5 mo. This approach addresses methodological limitations of past research, which include recall biases, demand characteristics, and low external validity. Consistent with hypotheses, female (vs. male) surgeons had more experiences in which their role was challenged or their authority questioned. Moreover, the frequency and severity of these experiences predicted increased burnout over time and decreased intentions to persist in surgery, regardless of whether participants attributed their experiences to their gender. Contrary to hypotheses, female surgeons did not encounter more presumptions of their helpfulness. Female surgeons also received more positive feedback, especially from other women, which yielded increases in professional efficacy and intentions to persist in surgery. Thus, while difficult to detect, workplace discriminatory treatment continues to harm women’s well-being and career opportunities, impede organizations’ efforts to recruit and retain women professionals, and exacerbate burnout among health care providers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415826122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2415826122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4728,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Global disparities in indoor wildfire-PM 2.5 exposure and mitigation costs","authors":"Dongjia Han, Yongxuan Guo, Jianghao Wang, Bin Zhao","abstract":"Wildfires have become more frequent and severe, and evidence showed that exposure to wildfire-caused PM 2.5 (fire-PM 2.5 ) is associated with adverse health effects.

We apply this argument to SGMA implementation, where local plans may respond more to local political economic conditions rather than address the groundwater problems prioritized by the state. Using a Structured Topic Model (STM) to analyze the content of 117 basin management plans, we regress each plan’s focus on core management reform priorities on local socio-economic and social-ecological indicators expected to shape how different communities respond to state requirements. Our results suggest that the focus of local plans diverges from problem conditions on issues like environmental justice and drinking water quality.

Workers routinely face resource shortfalls, complex client interactions, and ever-changing rules, prompting them to develop coping strategies. These instabilities, while disruptive, tend to be predictable, allowing those coping strategies to stabilize into routines that effectively constitute de facto, as distinct from de jure, policy. But what happens when instability becomes unpredictable, such as during wars, disasters, or pandemics, where prior experience offers little guidance? This paper explores two questions: (1) Do street-level workers develop different coping strategies under unpredictable, as opposed to predictable, instability? (2) Can those strategies become routinized amid unpredictable flux? The second question poses a conceptual challenge. If instability unfolds too rapidly and erratically for coping strategies to form, those strategies may never stabilize into the kind of routines that matter—those that shape policy in practice. To explore these questions, I modify the street-level bureaucracy framework by incorporating concepts from the turbulence literature, particularly the notion of robustness: patterned responses that enable systems to maintain core functions and values under conditions of unpredictable flux. Empirically, I draw from six-months of in-person and virtual ethnographic data to examine how leaders from a single U.S.-based street-level organization navigated the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Contrary to scholarship emphasizing innovation during the crisis, the leaders’ response was surprisingly ordinary, grounded in pre-existing behaviors. Theoretically, these findings suggest that even amid unpredictable instability, street-level workers can still develop routines that matter for policy-as-produced—not by inventing new coping strategies, but by reusing old ones, including those employed by leaders.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf016","doi":"10.1093/jopart/muaf016","journal_full":"Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory","dist":0.4817,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do welfare states have lower carbon emissions?

However, the rapid growth in volume and complexity of such internal rules may obstruct employee knowledge and understanding of such internal rules, and therefore also their compliance. The present study seeks to understand whether shorter and more accessible formats of internal company norms will yield better knowledge and understanding of such norms. The study consists of an extensive online field experiment randomly assigning 1235 employees of an international technology company to four treatments. In the long policy condition, employees received a 19‐page traditional policy written in standard legalese language. The short policy condition entailed a shortened two‐page version of this classic policy, and in the infographic condition, employees received an illustrated overview of the essential rules on a single page. A fourth group received no policy and served as a control condition. After reading the policy, employees completed several measures assessing their rule knowledge, perceived social norms, and played an incentivized bribery game. We find that (a) none of the types of policies presented improves rule knowledge or reduces corrupt behavior compared to the control treatment, and (b) no differences exist between the policies in influencing rules knowledge or reducing corrupt behavior. Instead, we find robust evidence indicating that people form their beliefs about corporate norms and decide how to behave in situations presenting high‐corruption risk based on what they consider to be the norm.

The analyses use data from EU-SILC and macro-level indicators from various sources to estimate general as well as household-typespecific effects using longitudinal methods. Results reveal important differences between specific policies: increasing minimum wages contributes to reducing low-wage risks, but has no significant effect on in-work poverty risks. In contrast, there is a negative effect of strict employment protection legislation across almost all household types on in-work poverty, which is consistent with the positive role this measure plays for supporting earnings that are sufficient to provide not only for one person, but also potential dependants in the household. With respect to redistributional policies, both unemployment benefits and benefits to low earners reduce poverty due to their contribution to public poverty-reduction. However, whereas unemployment benefits only reduce in-work poverty among couple households, benefits to low earners mainly contribute to lower poverty risks among employed single parents.

In this study, we apply mediation analysis to survey data from Austria and Germany (N=1,691) to assess which of these mechanisms help explain the relationship. Our results support the social disintegration hypothesis and the unmet needs hypothesis: Individuals who completely agree that income inequality is too high are slightly less likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through generalized social trust, and substantially more likely to give to charity (volunteer) due to the indirect relationship through impure altruism, when compared to those who completely disagree that income inequality is too high.

More specifically, we examine the enactment of the neoliberal society through three interlaced practices: (a) aesthetic self-presentation; (b) behavioural self-presentation; and (c) attitudinal self-presentation. We suggest that the neoliberal society, driven by the ethos of market rationality, contributes to primarily strengthening “the employable self” among residents in the elite community, through such expressions as leadership, commitment, energy and activity. In the working-class community, however, we show how an emphasis on modesty, perseverance and loyalty, are qualities framed as “unemployability”. Despite radically different socio-economic conditions, we suggest how both communities share significant commonalities in the way individuals' self-presentations of employability are shaped by the cultural and communal contexts in which they reside.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso.a.21","doi":"10.1162/euso.a.21","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.5051,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"To what extent do disadvantaged neighbourhoods mediate social assistance dependency?

More specifically, we examine the mediating roles of neighbourhood conditions and compare this effect to the well-known mediating effect of unstable work experiences. Our findings suggest a differential effect for individuals with a high versus low probability of receiving social assistance in early adulthood. For individuals with a baseline high probability of receiving early-adulthood social assistance, the total estimated effect of early-adulthood social assistance on mid-adulthood social assistance recipiency is over 15 per cent points. Neighbourhood disadvantage only has a minor mediating effect on average, however, for individuals with a high risk of early-adulthood social assistance, the effect is substantial, over 5 per cent points, even more than the mediating effect from unstable work. The findings suggest that for high-risk individuals, social assistance recipiency in young adulthood is linked to subsequent entrenchment in disadvantaged areas and unstable employment, reinforcing a cycle of poverty. Our findings contribute to understanding the complex interactions between policy, socioeconomic status, and environmental factors in perpetuating social assistance dependency.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf016","doi":"10.1093/esr/jcaf016","journal_full":"European Sociological Review","dist":0.5031,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The U.S. Place-Based Policy Supply Chain","authors":"Gordon H.

The apparatus is the product of 150 years of policy innovation, both from the top down, with the federal government periodically launching major initiatives whose place-based impacts tend to be long-lived (even if the specific policies are not), and from the bottom up, with state and local actors engineering their own policy solutions, many of which have endured and now constitute modern policy practice. That practice includes not just tax incentives for business investment, the subject of most economic research on place-based policy, but support for community redevelopment, workforce development, small business promotion, technological innovation, and regional planning and strategy. Intermediary organizations that connect government agencies to local recipients are central to resource delivery. Because they tend to be created, funded, and (or) run by non-state actors, there appears to be wide geographic variation in organizational capacity for place-based policy. Understanding the causes and consequences of that variation is needed for a full accounting of how place-based policy works in the U.S. (Stone Center on Socio-Economic Inequality Working Paper)","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2bg7a_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/2bg7a_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4558,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Replication of “Why voters who value democracy participate in democratic backsliding” in Germany’s multi-party context","authors":"Karolin Freitag, Laura Kiemes, Alexander Wuttke","abstract":"This report documents our replication of Braley et al.’s (2023) study, which examined whether voters become less willing to subvert democratic norms upon learning that their political opponents are more committed to democracy than previously assumed.

We field a nationally-representative survey experiment to estimate the effect of credit claiming and pork busting messages on the perceived effectiveness, fiscal responsibility, and overall approval of an unnamed member of Congress.

However, such policies often reinforce wealth inequality, particularly benefiting asset-rich households. Using information treatment and conjoint survey experiments in Australia and the UK in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, we examine how citizens navigate this trade-off. We find that informing respondents about the impact of financial stabilization policies on overall wealth inequality decreases support for such policies, whereas highlighting their effects on even larger wealth disparities between ethnic groups has little effect. Furthermore, respondents are more supportive of targeted policies aimed at reducing general wealth disparities than those targeting ethnic inequality.

In contemporary Austria, these cultural imaginaries are not only preserved but strategically reactivated within the political discourse of the radical right. The return of wolves to Austrian landscapes has become more than an ecological development – it has become a symbolic battlefield within the populist rhetoric of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). Drawing on Benjamin Moffitt and Simon Tormey’s concept of populism as a style, this study examines how the FPÖ performs populism through the figure of the wolf. Central to this style are the dramatization of crisis, a stark division between the “common rural people” and a detached “urban elite,” and the use of provocative language and imagery to assert authenticity and urgency. The analysis is based on a discourse analysis of FPÖ press releases, party manifestos, media appearances, and local events from 2010 to 2024. Importantly, the study incorporates an ecological foundation that contextualizes and challenges the FPÖ’s claims about large predators. Scientific research on wolf and bear behavior, ecological roles, and human-wildlife conflict is used to contrast and deconstruct political narratives driven by fear, misinformation, and ideological positioning. The results show that the FPÖ weaponizes the figure of the wolf to symbolically represent state failure, external control, and threats to traditional rural life, while selectively ignoring ecological facts. Gendered narratives further reinforce this rhetoric: male actors appear as protectors of land and culture, while female figures are framed as vulnerable mothers in need of protection. Ultimately, the case of the wolf in Austria demonstrates how ecological debates become deeply entangled with populist identity politics – and how addressing such conflicts requires not only scientific knowledge but also an understanding of the political and cultural performances shaping them.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9zh4_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/v9zh4_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4683,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Dynamic trade elasticities and comparative advantages: Evidence from a PTA","authors":"Mateo Hoyos, Rémi Stellian","abstract":"Quantitative trade models predict that trade elasticities vary with comparative advantages, but empirical evidence remains scarce.

We find that the average short-run trade elasticity is around 1.5, and converges to approximately 4 after seven years. These elasticities increase with comparative advantages: a move from the 25th to 75th percentile in comparative advantages is associated with a 2-percentage-point increase in the long-run elasticity. To measure comparative advantages, we construct a new Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) index -- the system bilateral RCA index -- that exploits trade flows across multiple trade partners while preserving the ability to compare Colombia with a specific trade partner regarding their respective comparative advantages. Our findings suggest that comparative advantage shapes the responsiveness of trade flows to policy changes, which has implications for trade theory and quantitative trade models.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6fya2_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/6fya2_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4539,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Places versus People: The Ins and Outs of Labor Market Adjustment to Globalization","authors":"David Autor, David Dorn, Gordon H. Hanson, Maggie R. Jones, Bradley Setzler, Carolyn Fisher","abstract":"This chapter analyzes the distinct adjustment paths of U.S. labor markets (places) and U.S. workers (people) to increased Chinese import competition during the 2000s. Using comprehensive register data for 2000–2019, we document that employment levels more than fully rebound in trade-exposed places after 2010, while employment-to-population ratios remain depressed and manufacturing employment further atrophies. The adjustment of places to trade shocks is generational: affected areas recover primarily by adding workers to non-manufacturing who were below working age when the shock occurred. Entrants are disproportionately native-born Hispanics, foreign-born immigrants, women, and the college-educated, who find employment in relatively low-wage service sectors such as medical services, education, retail, and hospitality. Using the panel structure of the employer-employee data, we decompose changes in the employment composition of places into trade-induced shifts in the gross flows of people across sectors, locations, and non-employment status. Contrary to standard models, trade shocks reduce geographic mobility, with both in- and out-migration remaining depressed through 2019. The employment recovery stems almost entirely from young adults and foreign-born immigrants taking their first U.S. jobs in affected areas, with minimal contributions from cross-sector transitions of former manufacturing workers. Although worker inflows into non-manufacturing more than fully offset manufacturing employment losses in trade-exposed locations after 2010, incumbent workers neither fully recover earnings losses nor predominantly exit the labor market, but rather age in place as communities undergo rapid demographic and industrial transitions.

The results show that incorporating additional family names, such as those of parents, substantially increases sample sizes while simultaneously minimizing errors. Using name distributions by ethno-religious background from mid-nineteenth-century Amsterdam population registers, between 81 and 86 percent of Amsterdam-born grooms and brides are accurately identified as either Jewish or Gentile on Dutch civil certificates between 1811 and 1932. I further demonstrate that the method is effective across time and across the Dutch provinces, producing Jewish samples that closely match their local population shares. Finally, I illustrate the potential of the approach by documenting the socioeconomic ascent of Amsterdam Jews from the second half of the nineteenth century onward, and discuss ways to extend the method through data linking and the incorporation of additional information.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c2aer_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/c2aer_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5098,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Logistics Performance and ESG Outcomes: An Empirical Exploration Using IV Panel Models and Machine Learning","authors":"Nicola Magaletti, Valeria Nortarnicola, Mauro Di Molfetta, Stefano Mariani, Angelo Leogrande","abstract":"This study investigates the complex relationship between the performance of logistics and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) performance drawing upon the multi-methodological framework of combining econometric with state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. Employing IV panel data regressions, viz. 2SLS and G2SLS, with data from a balanced panel of 163 countries covering the period from 2007 to 2023, the research thoroughly investigates how the performance of the Logistics Performance Index (LPI) is correlated with a variety of ESG indicators. To enrich the analysis, machine learning models—models based upon regression, viz. Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, Boosting Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Linear Regressions, and clustering, viz. Density-Based, Neighborhood-Based, and Hierarchical clustering, Fuzzy c-Means, Model Based, and Random Forest—were applied to uncover unknown structures and predict the behaviour of LPI. Empirical evidence suggests that higher improvements in the performance of logistics are systematically correlated with nascent developments in all three dimensions of the environment (E), the social (S), and the governance (G). The evidence from econometrics suggests that higher LPI goes with environmental trade-offs such as higher emissions of greenhouse gases but cleaner air and usage of resources. On the S dimension, better performance in terms of logistics is correlated with better education performance and reducing child labour, but also demonstrates potential problems such as social imbalances. For G, better governance of logistics goes with better governance, voice and public participation, science productivity, and rule of law. Through both regression and cluster methods, each of the respective parts of ESG were analyzed in isolation, allowing to study in-depth how the infrastructure of logistics is interacting with sustainability research goals. Overall, the study emphasizes that while modernization is facilitated by the performance of the infrastructure of logistics, this must go hand in hand with policy intervention to make it socially inclusive, environmentally friendly, and institutionally robust.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/huxcs_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/huxcs_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4563,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Influence of Messaging and Priming on Willingness to Pay in Monetizing Sustainable Technology Products","authors":"Colin Chung","abstract":"This study investigates how educational messaging and the timing of attitudinal questions influence stated consumer preferences for sustainable product components.

It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se or from other processes, such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These are difficult to disentangle in many settings, but in social media not only can they be decomposed, but platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when followed by a target account that we control, and we examine whether they reciprocate this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through the use of multiple control conditions in which the relevant tie is absent (never existent or removed), we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies. Platforms and others may rely on these tendencies in encouraging tie formation, with broader implications for network structure and information diffusion in online networks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ys8zw_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ys8zw_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4843,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone?

We define good jobs as those in industries in which full-time workers attain high wages, accounting for individual and regional characteristics. The share of good jobs in manufacturing has plummeted; for college graduates, good jobs have shifted to (mostly tradable) business, professional, and IT services, while for those without a BA they have shifted to (nontradable) construction. There is strong persistence in where good jobs are located. Over the last four decades, places with larger concentrations of good job industries have tended to hold onto them, consistent with a model of proportional growth. Turning to regional specialization in good job industries, we find evidence of mean reversion. Commuting zones with larger initial concentrations of good jobs have thus seen even faster growth in lower-wage (and mostly nontradable) services. Changing regional employment patterns are most pronounced among racial minorities and the foreign-born, who are relatively concentrated in fast growing cities of the South and West. Therefore, good job regions today look vastly different than in 1980: they are more centered around human-capital-intensive tradable services, are surrounded by larger concentrations of low-wage, non-tradable industries, and are more demographically diverse.

Our study offers an important caveat to this narrative. Using a novel empirical strategy that applies latent class modeling to conjoint data, we find that different segments of the American population use different cultural logics to sketch the contours of nationhood. However, these logics are not systematically patterned by partisanship: most Democrats, Republicans, and Independents articulate a vision of Americanness that fuses ethnocultural criteria with civic-oriented expectations for membership in America’s imagined community. Our findings complement and extend prior research by showing that different modes of measurement can yield credible evidence of both polarization and consensus. Whereas much of the existing literature relies on declarative measures of popular nationalism rooted in self-theorization, our design captures more intuitive judgments about national boundaries that are masked in traditional surveys. Consequently, our approach uncovers greater intraparty heterogeneity and interparty overlap than is often assumed, with two important implications. First, symbolic beliefs related to partisanship may be masking widely held ideas about nationhood embedded in public culture. Second, partisan debates may not only reflect competing nationalist logics, but contestation over who truly represents shared national values.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2n6dx_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/2n6dx_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.624,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Uneven Shifts: The Geography of Occupational Change in France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom 1992 – 2018","authors":"Katy Morris, Daniel Oesch","abstract":"Amid renewed interest in geographical inequalities in life chances and an ongoing debate about occupational upgrading versus polarisation, we investigate how the occupational structure changed across NUTS-2 regions in France, Italy, Spain and the UK between 1992 and 2018.

In every region, employment in high quality jobs grew while employment in low quality jobs shrank. These shifts were often large in magnitude: the proportion of employment in high quality jobs increased by more than 10 percentage points in two thirds of the regions studied. However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the rate and type of occupational upgrading. Strong upgrading and employment growth in the economic capital regions of Île-de-France (Paris), Lombardy, Madrid and London contrasted with weaker upgrading and sluggish (or even negative) employment growth in regions like Lorraine, Sicily, Extremadura and the West Midlands.

Our findings show that this Trojan Strategy enables Russian Telegram channels to reach audiences typically beyond their influence, such as Ukrainians. We further explain how Telegram’s policies and existing political communication practices in Ukraine and Russia facilitate the effectiveness of this strategy, ultimately expanding the known repertoire of Russian propaganda methods.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/34qwd_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/34qwd_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.365,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Decline of Low-wage Jobs","authors":"Nathan Wilmers, Clem Aeppli, Soohyun Roh","abstract":"From 2014 to 2024, the share of US hourly workers paid below $15 in real terms fell by two-thirds, from 38% to 13%. This drove declines in US labor market inequality for the first time since 1980, as pay increases in low-wage retail, food service and logistics jobs outpaced higher-status occupations. How did these substantial wage increases emerge? Using restricted-use microdata from the Occupational Employment and Wages Statistics and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, we find that rising pay across low-wage occupations, rather than declining inequality within-job or in workplace pay premiums, explains a majority of declining wage inequality since 2015. Contrary to creative destruction predictions, establishment exit contributed little to rising pay at the bottom. Low-paying employers of low-wage occupations contracted, but this accounts for less than a fifth of rising wages at the bottom. The main driver of rising pay was low- and middle-paying employers of low-wage occupations increasing pay. Notwithstanding organizational inertia, major gains for workers' pay can come from changes in existing workplaces.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7tf3m_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/7tf3m_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3973,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Sociological Uncertainty Principle","authors":"Saad Aldarbi","abstract":"This paper will be exploring the concept of “The Sociological Uncertainty Principle”, which draws inspiration from the concept of “The Uncertainty principle” by Werner Heisenberg, Heisenberg demonstrated that the more precisely the position of a particle is measured, the less precisely its momentum can be determined, and vice versa, due to inherent quantum mechanical limitations.

Four key themes emerged: distrust of authorities, immovable structural barriers, the bootstraps narrative of self-reliance, and the bridging role of social networks.

Background: Low mental health of single parents is a public health concern. Few studies have examined how patterns develop over the separation process and whether they differ for mothers and fathers. Method: Using data from the German Family Panel (N=1,409 non-separated and 466 separated parents), this paper examines the relationship between separation and parental mental health, spanning the period from three years before to two years after separation. As a method, it combines exact matching and fixed-effects methods. Results: While depression levels of separated parents are higher compared to the control group of parents in partnerships, we do not find any substantial increases in depression across the separation process, spanning from three years prior to two years post-separation. However, we find that patterns strongly differ by pre-partnership quality. Mothers and fathers in low-quality partnerships experience low mental well-being before separation but are likely to see improvement afterward. Conclusion: A longitudinal perspective on mental health trajectories is crucial for understanding the well-being of divorced and separated parents. Often, it is not the separation itself but the pre-existing conflict and stress that lower mental health. In such cases, union dissolution may be a pathway to improved mental well-being.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gby73_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/gby73_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4873,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"How Employer Wage-Setting Shapes Working Poverty","authors":"Henry Gomory, Nathan Wilmers","abstract":"Even hiring for the same occupation, some employers post the lowest wage possible, while others follow a high-road strategy. How does employer power over wage-setting shape working poverty? High-premium employers may lift workers out of poverty, but they may also exclude low-income applicants. We link household panel income data to employer wage records and find working poverty rates four times higher at low-premium employers, compared to high-premium employers, and poor hires twice as likely to stay in poverty. However, high-premium employers hire poor workers so rarely that they lift workers out of poverty less often than low-premium employers do. Employer pay-setting is a key determinant of working poverty overall: if all employers became high-premium, without changing employment composition, the working poverty rate would decrease by two-fifths. But reshuffling workers across employers would have little impact, as low-premium employers continue to pull workers into poverty. While low-paying employers harbor and produce the working poor, high-paying employers exclude them altogether.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxujs_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/hxujs_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4372,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Politicization of Wage Setting","authors":"Thomas Lyttelton, Nathan Wilmers","abstract":"Political realignment in America has reshuffled party affiliations across occupational lines. Increasingly the party of unions and minimum wages is also the party of managers and professionals. In this article, we investigate whether this realignment among the actors setting wages within firms has politicized wage setting. We first show that Democrat managers pay more to hourly workers, even comparing across firms within metro-occupation-industry-year local labor markets. This premium is confined to senior managers and human resources and compensation managers; a placebo test shows that operations managers' political affiliation is uncorrelated with wage levels. We then show, consistent with coalitional behavior, that the Democrat wage premium is larger for Democrat-leaning service jobs than for increasingly Republican blue-collar workers, and larger for women than for men. Democrat managers raise pay more around salient minimum wage increases and become relatively more likely to pay $15 wages specifically. In an experiment in which manager-employee partisan match is randomly assigned, managers are 10 percentage points more likely to assign co-partisans a higher wage. Finally, we show that the Democrat wage premium has grown in recent years, and that this accounts for 12% of extra wage increases for low-wage workers during this period. Taken together, these results suggest a politicization of wage-setting, wherein managers' liberal commitments benefit frontline workers in their political coalition.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k9gys_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/k9gys_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5152,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Sources of empowerment in environmental movement network organisation: Analysis of activists' sense of agency based on the qualitative study on Polish smog alerts","authors":"Michał Wróblewski, Joanna Suchomska, Sebastian Medoń","abstract":"Our analysis aims to identify the elements of an environmental movement network organisation that can be a source of a sense of empowerment within the organisation.

We argue that social psychological tools and understandings of how gender operates in social interaction are at the heart of the gender system. These approaches are useful because they specify, for instance, the ways in which cultural beliefs about gender influence a range of important social outcomes, such as a person’s self-concept and their decision-making, divisions of paid and unpaid labor, workplace discrimination, and the structure of organizations. Moreover, they attest to the highly contextual nature of gender interactions, showing how gendered structures are produced, sustained, and transformed overtime.

Using an elaborate differential exposure model, we provide more precise and nuanced insights into this by studying (1) how school exposure affects gains in reading comprehension and mathematics, and (2) whether it adapts inequalities by parental education, migration background, and gender. Leveraging unique administrative data from the Netherlands Cohort Study on Education on ~600k pupils over multiple grades (Grades 1-5), we exploit the quasi-random variation in test dates and calculate the exposure to schooling by the interval length between the mid-term and end-of-term tests. We find that while school exposure substantially boosts achievement by 0.5 S.D. in reading and 1.1 S.D. in mathematics per school year, these gains are not equally distributed. For reading, children with higher-educated parents and those without non-Western migration backgrounds benefit more from schooling, amplifying inequality. For mathematics, we find small compensatory patterns. These findings show that the effects of schooling on inequality are domain-specific, which we explain by the multiplicative nature of skill acquisition in schools and homes – an interaction that particularly boosts reading development in resourceful families.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/upzjh_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/upzjh_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5651,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"An Anatomy of Musical Blood: The Sociocultural Construction of Romani ‘Natural’ Musicality","authors":"Petr Nuska","abstract":"This article explores the phenomenon of ‘musical blood’ using the case of Slovak Roma to challenge both the specific myth of innate Romani musicality and the broader assumption that musical ability is genetically inheritable within ethnic groups. Rather than debunking racist ideas about primordially assigned ethnic features, the article advocates for a more nuanced and scholarly approach to understanding how musical abilities are constructed, perceived and valued within varying social and cultural environments. The article provides an overview of the literature on the heritability of musicality, focusing on the specifics (and pitfalls) of applying this concept to ethnic groups. Then, it critically examines how societal conceptions of music contribute to the persistence of the musical blood myth, suggesting that these beliefs are rooted in sociocultural narratives and stereotypes. It delves into an analysis of multifaceted sociocultural constructs that sustain the notion of ethnic musical predispositions; different sociocultural contexts shape the perception and valuation of musical enculturation, musical aptitude and music per se. The article then analyses the case of Slovak Roma to illustrate broader theoretical implications, providing a critical lens on the role of systemic biases held by non-Roma (heterostereotypes), Romani self-ascribed identification with the construct (autostereotypes), and mutual interactions thereof. While the article is based on the author’s long-term ethnographic observations in Gemer-Malohont in Slovakia (2013–2023), it pairs material from this context with existing ethnographic scholarship, covering cases of Romani musical blood in different sociocultural contexts.

Males were more willing to approach females and felt more enjoyment to be approached by females compared to females, with a statistically very significant difference between the two genders (p less than 0.01 in both instances). Females appeared to require a longer time to establish serious relationships than males, with a statistically significant difference between the two (p less than 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the level of tolerance toward hookups between males and females.

Ultimately, the chapter reflects on the current state of knowledge and identifies future directions for understanding the dynamics of social mobility and persistence.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uznr6_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/uznr6_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4453,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Missing the Margins: A Systematic Literature Review on the Demographic Representativeness of LLMs","authors":"Indira Sen, Marlene Lutz, Elisa Rogers, David Garcia, Markus Strohmaier","abstract":"Many applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) require them to either simulate people or offer personalized functionality, making the demographic representativeness of LLMs crucial for equitable utility. At the same time, we know little about the extent to which these models actually reflect the demographic attributes and behaviors of certain groups or populations, with conflicting findings in empirical research. To shed light on this debate, we review 211 papers on the demographic representativeness of LLMs. We find that while 29% of the studies report positive conclusions on the representativeness of LLMs, 30% of these do not evaluate LLMs across multiple demographic categories or within demographic subcategories. Another 35% and 47% of the papers concluding positively fail to specify these subcategories altogether for gender and race, respectively. Of the articles that report subcategories, less than half include marginalized groups in their study. Finally, 35% of 211 papers do not define the target population to whom their findings apply; of those that do define it either implicitly or explicitly, a large majority study only the U.S. Taken together, our findings suggest an inflated perception of LLM representativeness in the broader community. We recommend more precise evaluation methods and comprehensive documentation of demographic attributes to ensure the responsible use of LLMs for social applications.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vk3x6_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/vk3x6_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4601,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Exploring dynamics of online cultural evolution through agent-based simulations and online data","authors":"Pietro Leonardo Nickl, Mehdi Moussaid","abstract":"More and more cultural content is being produced and transmitted online while increasing competition for limited attention likely intensifies existing selective pressures on content. Therefore, it becomes important to understand the driving forces of cultural evolution in this environment. In this paper, we present an agent-based model to capture cultural transmission dynamics online, considering characteristics of digital online environments (low-cost production, high-fidelity transmission, high individual reach) that set them apart from offline scenarios. As a case study, we report preliminary findings of a rise in clickbait style in titles across online platforms, and use our model to explain which mechanisms could give rise to this pattern. Generally, the model serves to formulate predictions against which to compare observational data and we show how online trends can be interpreted in terms of cultural evolution. This work outlines an interdisciplinary research agenda for studying and understanding cultural evolution online, with possible implications for regulating online content and designing digital environments.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wfxsm_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/wfxsm_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4608,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"(Where) are teachers’ expectations of immigrant students really lower?","authors":"Katarina Wessling, Dominik Becker","abstract":"Teachers typically base their expectations on ‘valid’ criteria such as student performance and motivation. However, there is mixed evidence demonstrating that teachers hold lower expectations for immigrant students. We argue that the existence and strength of this relationship may depend on the framing effect of contextual settings. To establish this, we use data from the German National Educational Panel Study and analyze (1) whether teachers’ expectations of their elementary school students are influenced by students’ immigrant background; and (2) how this effect varies with the immigrant classroom composition, local neighborhood demographics, and teachers’ own immigrant background. Using multilevel panel models, we find negative associations between students’ immigrant, particularly Turkish, background and teachers’ expectations. These associations remain significant even when accounting for students’ aspirations and performance but disappear when accounting for students’ social background. However, we observe that the negative relationship between students’ immigrant background and teachers’ expectations remains robust and stable in contexts in which the immigrant category is salient, particularly in classrooms with high concentrations of immigrant students. We conclude that both research and educational practice could benefit from taking greater account of the contextualized formation of teachers’ stereotypes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x2ujz_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/x2ujz_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.6054,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Body mass index and workplace bullying: exploring causality in two general population Norwegian surveys, the HUNT study and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa)","authors":"Amanda Hughes, Gunnhild Åberge Vie, Alexandra Havdahl, Christina Hansen Edwards, Doriane Mignon","abstract":"Background: Previous studies suggest people with a higher BMI are at increased risk of bullying victimization in the workplace. It is unclear whether this reflects an impact of weight on bullying, an impact of bullying on weight, or confounding by other factors. Methods: We explore the impact of BMI on workplace bullying victimization (WPB) using data from working-age participants in two large, general population surveys from Norway, the Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT, N=32,826) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa mothers, N=14,076). We use genetic instrumental variable analysis to interrogate causal directionality in associations between BMI and WPB. In HUNT, we also conduct longitudinal analysis, examining whether BMI in 2006-08 predicts onset of WPB in 2017-19. Results: Participants with a higher BMI were more likely to report WPB, adjusted for confounders including socioeconomic position and psychological distress (absolute risk difference, ARD: 0.22% per kg/m2, CI: 0.13,0.31, p&lt;0.001 in HUNT, 0.22%, CI: 0.11, 0.33, p&lt;0.001 in MoBa). Genetic instrumental variable analysis found strong evidence for an impact of BMI on WPB only in MoBa (ARD: 0.65%, CI:0.06, 1.25, p=0.03 in MoBa, 0.03%, CI:-0.45,0.51, p=0.90 in HUNT). In longitudinal analyses, there was little evidence that BMI in 2006-08 affected WPB in 2017-19 (ARD: 0.01%, CI:-0.16,0.18, p=0.91), but WPB in 2006-08 was associated with slightly higher BMI in 2017-19 (0.16kg/m2, CI:0.02,0.29, p=0.02). Stratified analyses found inconsistent evidence of age, sex, and socioeconomic modification, but suggested a greater impact of BMI on WPB before 2020. Conclusions: In two large surveys from Norway, we found inconclusive evidence from genetic models that higher BMI increased risk of WPB. However, longitudinal analysis indicated that WPB affected BMI over time, consistent with an impact on BMI of psychosocial stress. Results underscore the negative consequences of WPB for physical, as well as mental, health.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zq4sk_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/zq4sk_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4277,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"A Comparison of Chinese and Western Qualitative Research Paradigms: With Chinese Traditional Discursive Research as the Core","authors":"WEI MENG","abstract":"This study focuses on the core differences between traditional Chinese and mainstream Western qualitative research paradigms. Western qualitative research emphasizes empirical observation, in-depth interviews and thematic induction, and is based on social constructivism and empiricism; whereas traditional Chinese academics build a unique logic of knowledge generation by focusing on classical texts, and integrating interpretation, philosophical deduction, and hieroglyphic thinking. Through comparative analysis, this paper proposes that there are fundamental differences between the two paradigms in six dimensions: ontology, epistemology, methodology, data foundation, conclusion formation and validation criteria. The study concludes that traditional Chinese discursive paths can be regarded as an important subcategory of qualitative research, embodying a cognitive system centered on cultural inheritance, moral reasoning and internal cognition. This study emphasizes the necessity of methodological pluralism and calls for the inclusion of non-Western paradigms of knowledge production in the global academic context in order to achieve a broader theoretical integration and civilizational dialogue.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zv79a_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/zv79a_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3672,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Predicting Teacher Mental Health: Demographics, Support, and Policy","authors":"David T.

Bibliometric Anomalies and the Integrity Crisis in Global University Rankings","authors":"Lokman I. Meho","abstract":"Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodhart’s Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f23k4_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/f23k4_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4216,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Application of the theory of “Military campaign success” based on the genetic algorithm of “The Art of War” to the war between Israel and Iran","authors":"WEI MENG, Xiaoyin Zhang","abstract":"This paper discusses the development of dynamics in the Israel-Iran conflict, with a forecast for 2024, using military wisdom inspired by Sun Tzu's Art of War in combination with genetic algorithms and complexity theory. The research points out how a variety of strategies undertaken result in combat resource consumption, morale, changes in international politics, and the creation of a multisegmented simulation in war between Israel and Iran. The research methodology includes a genetic algorithm that optimizes strategies, a nonlinear interaction analysis of complexity theory, and a calculus model that simulates resource depletion and morale changes. The results indicate that the rapid strike strategy of Israel participates in short-term superiority and deteriorates logistically and in morale as the duration of the war lengthens. On the contrary, Iran can flexibly adapt to a long war of attrition by using guerrilla warfare and asymmetric warfare. The result of the study indicates that Israel's capability for combat and supply lines would be weakened by the long war strategy, and asymmetric tactics by Iran hold an even higher advantage in this type of conflict; it must serve as a reference for strategic decision-making of nations in the future when confronting similar conflicts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j42ra_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/j42ra_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3575,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Making a nature positive commitment that stacks up for business and for nature","authors":"Jeremy Simmonds, Ailsa Kerswell, Martine Maron","abstract":"Businesses, governments and other organisations are increasingly making \"nature positive\" commitments, echoing the rise of \"net-zero\" carbon pledges.

The analysis identifies five primary adaptation strategies: crop and variety diversification, water management, agroforestry, temporal adjustments, and livelihood diversification. It also highlights significant barriers to adoption, including limited access to credit, inadequate extension services, gender disparities, and cultural beliefs. The findings reveal a disconnection between the adaptation techniques modelled and the practices of farmers, often attributable to socioeconomic and institutional constraints. Notably, regional differences influence adaptation choices, with northern farmers focusing on drought-resistant crops and migration, while southern farmers prioritize flood management and soil conservation. The study underscores the importance of participatory approaches in designing effective adaptation policies that align with local contexts. By integrating scientific models with indigenous knowledge and addressing systemic barriers, policymakers can enhance the resilience of smallholder farmers to climate variability. This research contributes to climate adaptation in West Africa by providing a comprehensive synthesis of existing literature and offering insights for targeted interventions in the Nigerian agricultural sector.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p8nb6_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/p8nb6_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4271,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Environmental Health Risk Assessment and Management: Community Engagement for Water Reuse Technologies","authors":"Amanda Wilson, Paula Kehoe, Kerry Hamilton, Paloma Beamer, Benjamin S.

To help promote community engagement in environmental health risk assessment and management, we provide rationales and approaches. We illustrate our points with a case study concerning water reuse, as water recycling technologies expand across the U.S. and the world to address water scarcity and increased water demand, considering a community engagement continuum framework. Formal environmental risk assessment has always had a required component for public notification to seek comments, but it is arguably not meaningful community engagement, as it is often done after the risk assessment is completed (without input) and in response to contamination without multi-directional community engagement. We show how effective multi-directional engagement of the community from the beginning of the risk assessment process can help to ensure that risk assessment and management are fair and effective. We also discuss some potential obstacles to effective community engagement concerning environmental health risk assessment and management and offer some recommendations for engineers, risk assessors, and policymakers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgpxb_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rgpxb_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3572,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"From Evidence Base to Evidence Use: Operationalizing the Integration not Concatenation (InC) Paradigm for Instructor-Driven Course Redesign","authors":"Rochelle E. Tractenberg","abstract":"Instructors in higher education are increasingly expected to integrate emerging content—such as ethical reasoning, artificial intelligence, or data literacy—into existing courses, often without adequate support, guidance, or alignment with evidence-based practices. This paper introduces a structured and research-informed paradigm for instructor-led course redesign: Integration not Concatenation (InC). InC equips instructors to revise their own syllabi, learning outcomes, and assessments in ways that embed new material coherently and evaluably, without disrupting the cognitive architecture of their courses. The InC paradigm is grounded in two cognitive-science-informed models of change: the augmented Diffusion of Innovations (aDOI) and the augmented Theory of Change Management (aToCM). These models reframe curricular change as a cognitively demanding process and offer practical guidance for supporting instructors through message framing, knowledge transfer, alignment, and feedback. The paper details how InC operationalizes these models in a multi-phase intervention—the Hackathon of Educational Materials—that builds instructional agility, coherence, and evaluability. We synthesize research from curriculum theory, backward design, cognitive load theory, and cognitive complexity to support InC’s theoretical and practical claims. Outcomes include alignment of course elements, enhanced instructor confidence, and support for higher-order student learning. The paper concludes with implications for broader adoption, including use in faculty development, general education reform, and evidence-based instructional design. InC offers a fidelity-focused, scalable, and actionable strategy to support instructor-led change—bridging the persistent gap between educational research and pedagogical practice.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u362f_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/u362f_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3606,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Framing Information Transfer Management (ITM): A Four-Zone Framework for Governing Knowledge in the Age of AI","authors":"aernout schmidt, Zhang Kunbei","abstract":"We propose a four-zone framework for understanding Information Transfer Management (ITM) in the age of advanced artificial intelligence.

Such communicative capacity is essential for any jurisdiction that seeks to regulate AI services. We demonstrate the framework’s analytic utility by profiling eight thinkers—Confucius, Mao Zedong, Smith, Friedman, Montesquieu, Bourdieu, Popper, and Goodfellow—across the four zones. This leads us to propose an epistemic shift within the \"Method\" zone itself, one that relates scientific authority to the forces of power, capital, and conviction.
