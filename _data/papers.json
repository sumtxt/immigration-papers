Second, one in which consumers have personal experience with the expert, reflecting markets in which consumer-expert interactions are frequent and repeated (e.g., general practitioner visits in healthcare markets). We find that the public rating system significantly improves market outcomes.

So‐called development is cloaked in containment development initiatives, which are benefiting few and damaging to many. MICs have been documented to be ineffective, and the respondents in this study say the same. Expanding beyond their ineffectiveness, however, is the perpetuation of global mobility injustice, which hasn't clearly been articulated in the literature. Against the backdrop of Gambians pleading for more open visa acquisition, the EU is far more likely to spend their time and money working on campaigns to do just the opposite: keep Gambians at home. Gambian youth are making choices to take dangerous routes to Europe and other international destinations because visas are elusive and their economic prospects at home remain bleak.

Evidence From Swedish Twin Data During 2009–2010", "authors": "Qinya Feng", "abstract": "The consequences of migration-induced diversity for social cohesion have received significant attention, yet recent research highlights the positive influence of social trust in shaping native-born people’s views on immigration. It remains unclear, however, whether the relationship is partially driven by prosociality, which is closely associated with but distinct from trust, or other confounders. This study uses Swedish twin data to examine these relationships, employing twin fixed effects to control for confounding factors shared within families. The findings show that generalised social trust and several forms of prosocial behaviour are associated with more favourable views on immigration policy, but only the effects of trust remain robust within the identical twin subsample. The influence of trust appears independent of prosociality and primarily relates to immigrant acceptance. Overall, the findings suggest that generalised trust reflects an inclusive outlook.

Through calculating a counterfactual, we assess the gendered outcomes differentiated between elections, parliaments and parties, to show that party culture plays a pivotal role in shaping the effects of voluntary party quotas within the context of electoral system changes.

As a case study for this outlook, the centrist project of French president Emmanuel Macron is analysed. A new theory of centrism is then presented – centrism as a structure for political action – which recognises both the lack of political concepts within centrism and the inclusion of a political strategy which makes it an observable phenomenon: a politics which oscillates between left and right. Within liberal democracies, centrism offers a strategy for action, derived from a critique of left and right political establishments. Yet it does so in an ideational context largely shaped by existing ideologies of left and right, moderate and extreme. While oscillation may ease political decision-making, as a strategy, it does not inscribe specifically centrist political ideas.

The article’s theoretical ambition is to improve on the normative debate on technical legitimacy. Existing defenses fail to robustly satisfy the reasons that ground delegation to non-majoritarian institutions.

Yet, while this model assumes an effect of stable personality traits, populist radical right support tends to fluctuate. This study addresses this inconsistency and examines to what extent the link between personality and populist radical right support depends on cultural threats as induced by negative contact with non-natives. Using two-wave German panel data, we find no evidence that increased negative contact strengthens the personality–populist radical right link. However, our findings reveal two nuanced yet tentative patterns. First, initial exposure to negative contact may increase populist radical right support among those low in Agreeableness/Openness. Second, when the outgroup is framed as “foreigners,” increased negative contact may strengthen the role of personality, but not when defined as “Muslims” or “refugees.” These findings bear important implications for our psychological understanding of populist radical right support.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00323217251412067", "doi": "10.1177/00323217251412067", "journal_full": "Political Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012212518339869693}, {"title": "“Show, Don’t Tell”: How Communication Teams Develop the Visual Strategies of Populist and Non-Populist Actors", "authors": "Francesco Melito, Mattia Zulianello", "abstract": "Despite the growing attention to visual political communication (VPC), we still know little about how visuals are produced by populist and non-populist actors.

Our exploratory study offers an unprecedented “insider” perspective on the conception, design, and deployment of political visuals, providing new insights into VPC. Notably, the findings challenge common assumptions about the distinctiveness of populist VPC, revealing that hallmark features often associated with populism—such as emotionally charged imagery and specific chromatic and stylistic choices—are frequently adopted by non-populist actors as well.

Using logit models on longitudinal data from Chile (1990–2022), I assess how critical events affect commission appointments. The study draws on a novel dataset constructed through archival research and develops an original indicator of critical events using billions of media records from Google Jigsaw's Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The findings reveal a conditional logic: high presidential disapproval and frequent critical events are associated with greater use of commissions, whereas sustained or severe events are linked to lower use.

The pattern is stronger when firms' management faces contentious proposals in shareholder meetings and may thus need institutional investors' support. We further show that firms' giving shifts away from business-relevant politicians and is strongly aligned with the individual campaign donations of the institutional investors' employees. These results, together with the finding that the effects are larger for more ``partisan\" and privately owned investors, suggest that the influence we uncover is driven by institutional investors' own political views, rather than a profit-maximizing strategy for the portfolio firms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag010", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag010", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00481926430059354}, {"title": "Correction to: Tax Policy and Lumpy Investment Behaviour: Evidence from China's VAT Reform", "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag006", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag006", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03238519233180748}, {"title": "Destabilizing Capital Flows amid Global Inflation", "authors": "Julien Bengui, Louphou Coulibaly", "abstract": "Over the latest monetary policy tightening cycle, capital has been flowing from low-inflation countries to high-inflation countries. This pattern of capital flows is consistent with the predictions of an open-economy model with nominal rigidities where cost-push shocks generate an inflationary episode and capital flows freely across countries. Yet, by raising demand for domestic non-tradable goods and services, capital inflows cause unwelcome upward pressure on firms’ costs in countries most severely hit by these shocks. We find that a reverse pattern of capital flows would have improved the output-inflation trade-off globally, hence requiring a less aggressive monetary tightening in the most severely hit countries and delivering overall welfare gains.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag007", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag007", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010960172661066525}, {"title": "Inference Based on Time-Varying SVARs Identified with Sign Restrictions", "authors": "Jonas E Arias, Juan F Rubio Ramírez, Minchul Shin, Daniel F Waggoner", "abstract": "We propose an approach for Bayesian inference in TV structural vector autoregressions (SVARs) identified with sign restrictions.

Our methodology is new to the literature. In contrast to existing algorithms for inference based on sign restrictions, our algorithm is the first to draw from a uniform distribution over the sequences of orthogonal matrices given the reduced-form parameters.

Specifically, college-educated workers’ allocative wages are highly pro-cyclical, while high school dropouts’ wages exhibit only moderate cyclicality. Further, as education increases, an increasing share of the sensitivity of allocative wages is driven by the persistent scarring effects of the cyclical position at the time of hiring on the wages associated with higher levels of tenure, amounting to more than a third of the overall sensitivity for the college educated. The greater job stability of the more educated—and therefore the exposure to scarring—contributes to these differences. In addition, more significant scarring at each horizon of tenure amplifies the effect. In service of documenting these facts, I develop new methods for inferring the sensitivity of labour costs to shocks when agents are forward-looking and wages may be intertemporally smoothed.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag002", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag002", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007193579419749185}, {"title": "Platelet-derived integrin- and tetraspanin-enriched tethers exacerbate severe inflammation", "authors": "Charly Kusch, David Stegner, Lukas J.

In this paper, we develop an intersectional framework that conceptualizes applicant-job requirement matching as a form of “proof” that the applicant meets the evaluative standard for the job, and that the burden of proof is unequally distributed across job applicants’ combined gender and racial statuses. White men applicants, who align with the abstract evaluative standard for professional positions, benefit from assumed abilities even without evidence of matching job requirements, whereas Black men, Black women, and White women applicants must match job requirements to “prove” that they meet screening standards. We test this theory empirically with two original experimental studies: a nationally representative survey experiment and a correspondence audit study of accountants. We find that stereotyping and hiring screening discrimination varies across the applicant-job requirement match: discrimination is heightened when job applicants do not meet the requirements, and reduced when matched to requirements. The burden of proof through matching requirements therefore falls to Black men, Black women, and White women—and we find that Black women applicants experience unique outcomes due to their “intersectional invisibility.” This article contributes to our understanding of hiring discrimination and gender and racial inequality in the labor market.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf243", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf243", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.05930756348409738}, {"title": "Review of “The Diversity of Morals”", "authors": "Brain M Lowe", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf224", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf224", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.5868138790286659}, {"title": "Review of “Unlocking the Red Closet: Gay Male Sex Workers in China”", "authors": "Doug Guthrie", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf238", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf238", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.07111786960672806}, {"title": "Review of “Governing the Global Clinic: HIV and the Legal Transformation of Medicine”", "authors": "Claire Decoteau", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf231", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf231", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.13429367505392475}, {"title": "Review of “Growing Up Godless: Non-Religious Childhoods in Contemporary England”", "authors": "Isabella Kasselstrand", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf237", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf237", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.05831725696969314}, {"title": "Review of “Psychedelic Outlaws: The Movement Revolutionizing Modern Medicine”", "authors": "Michael L Rosino", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf216", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf216", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06209629782620685}, {"title": "Review of “Industrial Islamism: How Authoritarian Movements Mobilize Workers”", "authors": "Eric W Schoon", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf225", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf225", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.1462412798052628}, {"title": "Review of “Listeners Like Who?

The findings reveal that citizens value candidates who represent the will of the people and do not belong to a particular political party, compared to those who are affiliated with political parties and are primarily accountable to a parliament.

The authors argue instead that perceptions of competence shape voter choices for incumbents, for main opposition options, and for challengers alike.

After migrating, treated individuals exhibited significantly higher trust in Indian democratic institutions and greater political participation—except for voting, which is difficult to do from abroad. Additionally, they were no more willing to trade democracy for economic growth than control group subjects. The treatment group’s political preferences stem from comparing their experiences under democratic and, as migrants, autocratic governments.

Yet we know little about the consequences of aging for the electoral politics of economic performance. This article develops a novel theoretical framework linking aging to lower economic growth in four interrelated steps. First, elderly voters care more about pensions than other voters do, but less about policies related to child care, family, and education. Second, elderly voters are less likely to penalize governments for low growth and unemployment. Third, gray power pushes governments to protect the growing share of budgets allocated to pensions at the expense of more growth-enhancing policies, most notably social and public investments, while also weakening policy responsiveness during recessions. Fourth, this policy reallocation undermines economic growth. The author tests this theory using multilevel and fixed-effects regressions, an instrumental variable approach, and causal mediation analysis on micro- and macrolevel data across twenty-one acds from the 1960s onward.

This paper explores an interpretive shift in the reception of Plato in eighteenth-century Europe, focusing on Voltaire’s Socrate (1759), a three-act play dramatizing the trial and death of Socrates. I advance a reading of the play as an effort to offer a new political extension of a recent epistemological realignment in interpretations of Plato’s philosophy. Plato’s eighteenth-century readers developed an understanding of his epistemology that negotiated a compromise between Neoplatonism and Academic Skepticism. Working out the political ramifications of this compromise, I argue, was central to Voltaire’s reimagination of Socrates’s trial. In turn, Voltaire’s play calls attention to a neglected dimension in which the contingencies of historically situated, idiosyncratic interpretations can bear out in the dynamics of disciplinary canons: how authors’ philosophical receptions interact with their receptions in political thought. At the same time, the play also offers a case study of an intervention in the symbolic meanings of Plato, one in which the deep-rooted associations he accrued in two ancient traditions that claimed him as a figurehead were reshuffled in a distinctly modern, political key.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917251413537", "doi": "10.1177/00905917251413537", "journal_full": "Political Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00837573970669947}, {"title": "Protest, Law, Repression, and the Limits of Disobedience", "authors": "John Medearis", "abstract": "For decades, the most prominent philosophical work on protest has focused on disobedience.

It has also perpetuated an inadequate vision of law, lawmaking, and their relationship to protest in liberal constitutional polities—a vision of who makes law, how it is made, the posture of lawmakers toward protest, and the democratic significance of law. A survey of the legal history of strikes, boycotts, and mass street protests demonstrates that this vision is too limited. Most significantly, it shows that disobedience is not necessarily disobedience to democratic authority, even where liberal constitutions reign. Historical review also uncovers the vital importance of legal repression. So any critical philosophy of protest should incorporate a much more realistic vision of law.

Although enslaved people’s fugitivity in the United States is often understood through the story of complete escape, there were many more enslaved people who fled within slave states. This article defines liminal fugitivity as a type of flight in which enslaved people fled to peripheral spaces near sites of enslavement, such as crawl spaces, edges of forests, or borders of towns and plantations. It reads Harriet Jacobs’s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl as an illustration of liminal fugitivity. Jacobs spent seven years hiding in an attic near the home of her enslaver in order to watch over her children and secure their escape. Her narrative both shows how enslaved women’s lives often necessitated fugitivity within slave states and illustrates some of the generative possibilities of liminal fugitivity. In particular, liminal fugitivity illustrates the importance of kinship and social ties, as hiding in liminal spaces allowed fugitives to escape while retaining networks of care. This article contributes to recent work on fugitivity and fugitive democracy by theorizing liminal fugitivity’s relational characteristics as a form of resistance to slavery itself, as enslaved people who fled to keep their families together were refusing the regime of family separation on which U.S. chattel slavery partially depended.

I begin by examining Marx’s ideas of primitive accumulation and original expropriation, showing how his incomplete analysis of social relations to land can be extended to the trans-Atlantic context. Drawing on Marx’s pre- Capital manuscripts, I examine his treatment of ground rent and its relationship to feudalism, highlighting how the development of capitalism in the West relied on mechanisms overlooked in conventional readings of Marx’s work. I argue that settler colonialism in the New World did not follow the same logic as European primitive accumulation, where land was taken from peasants. Instead, speculative expropriators gave land to settlers, but only under specific racial and gendered conditions that tied landowners to the financial and political systems of the settler state. The land was often granted with mortgages and preemptive land sales, which placed settlers in debt and subjected them to the control of colonial institutions. This financial framework, grounded in the dispossession and genocide of Indigenous peoples, allowed capitalism to expand through speculative real estate and colonial constructs. By theorizing speculative expropriation, I show how the dynamics of settler colonialism reinvented capitalist accumulation, turning land ownership into a means of controlling settlers through debt rather than directly extracting their labor. This framework provides a new lens for understanding how capitalism expanded across the Atlantic and solidified its global reach in tandem with Indigenous dispossession and population replacement.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917251398813", "doi": "10.1177/00905917251398813", "journal_full": "Political Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.032025908886185506}, {"title": "Dimension-specific party and public opinion responsiveness in the EU immigration acquis", "authors": "Miriam Sorace, Natascha Zaun", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2025.2605929", "doi": "10.1080/01402382.2025.2605929", "journal_full": "West European Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9836712042183523}, {"title": "Homeownership and political efficacy: how housing wealth shapes whether people feel heard", "authors": "Matthias Haslberger, Mads Andreas Elkjær, Ben Ansell", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01402382.2026.2616109", "doi": "10.1080/01402382.2026.2616109", "journal_full": "West European Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011921988020745844}, {"title": "Fateful triangles: integration, race and evidence-based policymaking in Sweden and the UK", "authors": "Yasmin Gunaratnam, Sarah Hamed, Fataneh Farahani", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2026.2615859", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2026.2615859", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03903690892112355}, {"title": "Care amid crisis: Marvel Cooke's abolitionist writing on the “Bronx Slave Market”", "authors": "Anthony Obst", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2607605", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2607605", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.050718598707225615}, {"title": "Kindergarten panic: parental anxiety and school choice inequality", "authors": "Danica R.

Together, these findings suggest contrarian orientations may reflect a (frustrated) narcissistic demand to be recognized as better than others, both collectively and individually.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70114", "doi": "10.1111/pops.70114", "journal_full": "Political Psychology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010982365833453689}, {"title": "Conditions of Confinement: Do Harsher Prison Conditions Reduce Political Participation?", "authors": "Jacob Harris", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-026-10120-3", "doi": "10.1007/s11109-026-10120-3", "journal_full": "Political Behavior", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.027940319692667304}, {"title": "The Heterogeneous Associations of Rural Consciousness and Political Preferences", "authors": "Trent Ollerenshaw", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10113-8", "doi": "10.1007/s11109-025-10113-8", "journal_full": "Political Behavior", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03438280637815838}, {"title": "Unlocking the Potential of Multicultural Migrants: Cultural Brokering Scale Development and Validation", "authors": "Davina Vora, Stacey R Fitzsimmons, David C Thomas", "abstract": "Migrant employees have knowledge, skills, and abilities that may not be recognized by organizations or countries.

SSA is widely viewed by scholars, pundits, and policymakers as the region where migration rates have only just begun to climb the upward slope. Adopting a long-run historical perspective, we revise this image in three respects. First, although migration out of SSA has recently increased, Africans overall have not become more migratory since colonial times. The share of Africans living abroad was high in the 1960s, reflecting the legacy of large-scale interterritorial migration during the colonial era. Second, voluntary mass migration within Africa expanded rapidly in an era that is not typically regarded as “developmental,” after the abolition of slavery in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Large numbers of voluntary migrants, often extremely poor by historical standards, moved toward zones of cash-crop production and mining, and later increasingly to urban destinations. Third, we argue that the recent surge in extracontinental migration reflects a shift in destinations within a much longer migration transition rather than its early stage. This shift was driven by narrowing spatial opportunity gaps within Africa, growing hostility to intra-African migration in the context of nation building, and the simultaneous expansion of capabilities and opportunities for migration beyond the continent.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251406191", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251406191", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9882334565517343}, {"title": "Book Review: Host Cities JacobsenKaren. 2025.

Results from structural equation modelling show that individuals who experienced frequent moves in childhood tend to identify less with the city, region, and country in which they live; yet this appears to have no direct consequences for their social capital. In contrast, they report a stronger sense of personal agency—defined as feeling more confident in addressing problems and making decisions—which, in turn, enhances their ability to maintain supportive networks.

Previous studies have highlighted the strong zero-shot classification performance of large language models (LLMs), offering a potential tool to efficiently identify harmful content. Yet for complex and ambivalent tasks like hate speech detection, pre-trained LLMs can be insufficient and carry systemic biases. Domain-specific models fine-tuned for the given task and empirical context could help address these issues, but, as we demonstrate, the quality of data used for fine-tuning decisively matters. In this study, we fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini using a unique corpus of online comments annotated by diverse groups of coders with varying annotation quality: research assistants, activists, two kinds of crowd workers, and citizen scientists. We find that only annotations from those groups of annotators that are better than zero-shot GPT-4o-mini in recognizing hate speech improve the classification performance of the fine-tuned LLM. Specifically, fine-tuning using the highest-quality annotator group – trained research assistants – boosts classification performance by increasing the model’s precision without notably sacrificing the good recall of zero-shot GPT-4o-mini. In contrast, lower-quality annotations do not improve and may even decrease the ability to identify hate speech.

We find support for this hypothesis from two studies, which leverage cross-sectional variation within cohorts in exposure to immigration salience in voters’ formative years. The first employs congruence data from a survey of 10 European countries, linked to historical salience data from the Comparative Manifesto Project. The second is a within-country study, measuring salience and congruence from two long-running German public opinion survey series. The analysis suggests that growing up at times when immigration is high on the political agenda can have long-term consequences for the relationship between voters’ preferences on that issue and their political choices, shedding light on the mechanism behind ‘generational realignment’.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676525100534", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676525100534", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.98928853509946}, {"title": "Enhancing public support for international sanctions: An information provision experiment", "authors": "Jaroslaw Kantorowicz, Elena Kantorowicz-Reznichenko", "abstract": "We examine whether different information frames affect how people perceive the domestic costs of sanctions and support sanctions.

Using survey experiments in 14 European countries, we examine how party supporters react to responses their preferred parties might take to the rise of a hypothetical new party. Our results primarily highlight that voters care about substantive representation. They endorse accommodative responses towards a new party offering a policy they agree with. Thus, the extent to which party responses bind supporters to established parties is highly contingent on the distribution of policy positions among their supporters. Often, established parties must walk a precarious tightrope, balancing the need for unity with some degree of tolerance for dissent.

We find no evidence that the wealth gap arises because districts likely to elect women also elect wealthier members, or because women had more lucrative pre‐Congressional careers. We do find evidence that the gap can be explained by women facing steeper challenges that wealth helps them overcome—particularly related to caregiving—and by Congresswomen's spouses earning more money than Congressmen's spouses.

Our findings indicate that these specialized venues significantly deter environmental misconduct, with stronger effects observed among larger firms and those in less-polluting industries. Mechanism analyses further show that increases in firms’ innovation efforts, rather than enhanced government attention to environmental issues, help explain these observed compliance improvements, clarifying the causal pathways through which venue specialization enhances policy compliance. By linking institutional design directly to compliance outcomes, we move beyond the conventional process-oriented focus of policy venue research and demonstrate how new, specialized institutions affect governance outcomes.

This paradox raises questions about religion’s function in far-right discourse. I argue that far-right parties systematically use a conservative reading of Christianity as a demarcation tool – marking not only Islam but also cultural liberalism as incompatible with a Christian-framed ingroup.

the drivers and barriers to ending programs, such as the emergence of fiscal and other exigencies, which can lead to policy and program cancellation, but also noted that such factors do not always lead to closure. More recent work has advanced thinking on the subject and acknowledged a wider range of possible policy choices beyond simple cancellation, including modest reform or termination of small parts of a policy and more substantial partial dismantling, and in so doing has altered the nature of the field. Both these literatures to date, however, have struggled to identify the underlying reasons for alternative courses of action, focusing almost exclusively on the relative strengths and balance of power of social coalitions promoting termination versus those supporting the status quo, which is at best indicative. This logic also fails to deal with terminations that occur in spheres where social actors are less prominent, which are the subject of this article. The article uses examples from defense policy and military spending in Canada to examine the rise, cancellation, resurrection, and downscaling of several interlinked major naval weapons programs over the period 1975–2025 in order to explore the dynamics present in state-driven terminations. It focuses particular attention on the role of changing government commitments to programs and requests desired by armed forces, highlighting program continuation when government-service visions remain aligned and termination or dismantling when they do not.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/polsoc/puaf030", "doi": "10.1093/polsoc/puaf030", "journal_full": "Policy and Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008562572687598968}, {"title": "From moderation to chaos: Meta’s fact-checking and the battle over truth and free speech", "authors": "Regina Cazzamatta", "abstract": "Following Zuckerberg’s decision to terminate third-party fact-checking and his association of fact-checkers with censorship, this article examines how platforms respond to falsehoods post-debunking and explores fact-checkers’ views on effective content moderation, particularly regarding content removal or reduced visibility.

We begin our analysis by isolating the cultural script through automated analysis of a corpus of antisemitic texts. Next, using survey data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic ( n = 17,800), we document an increase in antisemitism among Christian believers. This, we argue, is due to the pandemic activating the cultural script of traditional antisemitism, which links Judaism with the spread of disease. By means of an additional survey ( n = 2,000) and a concept association task, we demonstrate the presence of the cultural script in the minds of Christian believers.

But other scholarship indicates that these very same publics want to abolish nuclear arsenals. A lack of comparative analyses across the Global North and the Global South limits the generalizability of these claims. Does a categorical dichotomy between nuclear deterrence and disarmament really reflect global public views on the bomb? What explains a multitude of seemingly inconsistent scholarly results? In this reflection essay, we argue that deterrence and disarmament are not necessarily incompatible tools for reducing nuclear dangers. We point to several ways that individuals might simultaneously accommodate both pro- and antinuclear weapons policy positions. To investigate this proposition, we offer a new observational dataset on global nuclear attitudes from a survey we conducted in 24 countries on six continents ( N = 27,250).

This paper examines Chinese youth studying in two prominent Southeast Asian destinations—Thailand and Singapore—to understand how their aspirations intersect with macro‐structural forces to shape differentiated mobility pathways. Drawing on interviews with 59 participants, we explore three interrelated themes: (1) how geopolitical and geoeconomic developments reconfigure opportunity structures for Chinese youth; (2) how students navigate enduring hierarchies within the regional and global landscapes of higher education; and (3) how transregional education spaces reshape future‐making projects under conditions of heightened uncertainty. Our findings reveal that in Thailand, the BRI has widened access to regional education‐migration opportunities for Chinese youth by expanding institutional linkages and legitimising alternative mobility routes. In contrast, Chinese students in Singapore rarely frame their educational choices through the BRI, instead mobilising other forms of capital within established hierarchies of international education. Despite the emergence of diversified intra‐Asian pathways beyond traditional Western destinations, students' aspirations remain structured by stratified geographies of higher education and calibrated to broader geopolitical dynamics.

Existing research is limited by three key shortcomings: neglecting the roles of key household members, oversimplifying the dichotomy between migrants and nonmigrants, and adopting a static view of household income without considering its growth trajectory. This study addresses these gaps by employing growth curve models and analyzing six waves of data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) spanning the period from 2010 to 2020. We examine how the livelihood choices of rural household heads—farming, local nonfarm work, and migration—affect household income growth trajectories. Our findings indicate that the livelihood choice of the household head is a significant predictor of household income growth. Although migrant‑headed households typically enjoy an economic advantage, the beneficial effects of migration for this depend on the household's life stage, with younger and female‑headed households and those undertaking short‑term migration experiencing more substantial gains. Extending the migration period has minimal effect on accelerating the rate​ of household income growth.

In the spatial panel analysis, growth in disparity reveals a significant negative effect on crude birth rates, while the multilevel models confirm that regions with sharper increases in inequality recorded fewer births per woman.

While previous research has largely focused on single cases or experimental designs, we offer the first comprehensive, comparative study of party-led referendum boycotts across Europe since 1972. Drawing on a novel dataset of 223 referendums in 37 countries, we combine quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how regime context, institutional design, and issue type shape boycott behavior. Our regression analyses show that turnout quorum requirements, lower levels of democratic maturity, and sovereignty-related referendum issues significantly increase the likelihood of boycotts. To complement these findings, we qualitatively analyze boycott justifications and develop a typology of six motivation types: legitimacy-based, procedural unfairness, instrumental, tactical, minority interest, and ideological boycotts.

Regarding optimal tax policy, the wage compression channel remains effective through the trickle‐down effect of subsidizing high‐wage earners and taxing low‐wage earners. Yet, the wage compression channel via capital, corporate, and R&amp;D taxes, aimed at reducing wage inequality, does not operate via a trickle‐down effect. Instead, it works by taxing capital income and R&amp;D investments in high‐task‐complexity sectors while subsidizing those in low‐task‐complex sectors.

The penalty declines sharply with the length of ownership. It reduces the self‐insurance value of cars and leads to a large reduction in transaction volumes and the rate of car turnover.

Using data on 3,917 policy instruments across 43 OECD countries and major emerging economies from 2000-2022, we show that national climate policy portfolios specializing in instrument types and sectors are associated with faster reductions in fossil CO 2 emission intensity. Supported by exemplar country case studies, we also provide quantitative evidence that the effectiveness of climate policy is amplified by long-term emission reduction targets and the presence of dedicated governmental bodies including ministries and intergovernmental organisations. The cumulative effect of all climate policy portfolios over our study period amounts to 3.1 GtCO 2 fewer emissions in 2022 relative to a no-policy counterfactual - substantially less than what’s needed to stay on track for the Paris Agreement goals.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68577-z", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68577-z", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010579747196781675}, {"title": "Spatial heterogeneity and subtypes of functional connectivity development in youth", "authors": "Hongming Li, Zaixu Cui, Matthew Cieslak, Taylor Salo, Tyler M.

In recent years, scholars have begun using such terms in dynamic regression models with time series data. However, the lack of guidance on adding multiplicative interactions to these workhorse models exposes problems with the consistency of the estimator, model restrictions, and interpretation. This paper provides theoretical and practical guidance to address these problems. First, we define the conditions under which scholars can ensure consistent estimates when estimating relationships conditioned by a moderating variable in dynamic models. Second, we introduce a general model that makes no theoretical assumptions about precisely how conditional relationships unfold over time. Third, we develop a flexible approach for interpreting such models. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework with simulation evidence and an empirical application.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2026.10087", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2026.10087", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006596276851064564}, {"title": "Inclusion to exclude: how femonationalism impacts policy preferences", "authors": "Sophie Mainz", "abstract": "How does femonationalism, defined as the selective invocation of gender equality to promote exclusionary anti-immigrant policies, affect citizens? While increasingly common across Western democracies, its impact on citizens’ preferences remains underexplored. This paper provides evidence from a preregistered survey experiment with 3,118 U.S. citizens, showing that femonationalist rhetoric can enhance opposition to pluralist policies in defense of progressive gender achievements. The effect is conditional on citizens’ prior immigration attitudes: anti-immigration individuals liberalize their gender views, while pro-immigration individuals demand stricter integration policies. The findings suggest that citizens are not consistent in their ideological preferences, especially when political elites frame liberal values as conflicting.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10068", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10068", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9841161824007298}, {"title": "Forecasting the use of force: a word embedding analysis of China’s rhetoric and military escalations", "authors": "Jackie S.H.

While the conventional hands-tying mechanism argues that official rhetoric binds leaders to stated positions and limits their ability to back down, recent scholarship on bluster suggests that autocracies may employ hawkish rhetoric to justify de-escalation ex-post. This study evaluates these competing perspectives by analyzing China’s official rhetoric and military behavior in the Taiwan Strait from 2016 to 2022. Employing a word-embedding approach, I construct an original Chinese-language lexicon capturing implicit threats from over two million state-media articles. I show that increases in China’s implicit threats toward Taiwan are associated with a higher likelihood of military escalation, implying that official rhetoric conveys predictive information rather than mere cheap talk.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10085", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10085", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006414244387924817}, {"title": "Community-level education percentile rank estimation in China using multi-source big data and machine learning", "authors": "Yanji Zhang, Zhenyu Pan, Yongyi You, Liang Cai, Bo Qin", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06664-y", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06664-y", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010430738689284236}, {"title": "The dataset for extending EMNIST evaluation", "authors": "Julian Szymański, Kacper Skarżyński, Błażej Szutenberg, Klaudia Ratkowska, Szymon Drywa", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-06291-z", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-025-06291-z", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007306956574771317}, {"title": "Chromosome-level genome assembly of the stonefly Rhopalopsole triangulispina Mo and Li, 2025 (Plecoptera: Leuctridae)", "authors": "Aili Lin, Jinjun Cao, Dávid Murányi, Ding Yang, Weihai Li, Raorao Mo", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06631-7", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06631-7", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.12450192149522843}, {"title": "An Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Data Reconstruction (1986–2024)", "authors": "Yihe Tian, Kwan Man Cheng, Zhengbo Zhang, Tao Zhang, Junning Feng, Zhehao Ren, Suju Li, Dongmei Yan, Bing Xu", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06549-0", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06549-0", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0317153799142762}, {"title": "Highly contiguous chromosome-level assembly of the rock goby (Gobius paganellus) genome", "authors": "Paolo Franchini, Giulia Gentile, Martin Pippel, Amando Macali, Daniele Canestrelli", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06659-9", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06659-9", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.12172152977079531}, {"title": "SYSU_Topo: a 1-arc-minute global bathymetry from SWOT-derived gravity using the gravity-geological method", "authors": "Wei Feng, Dechao An, Cheinway Hwang, Mingzhi Sun, Xiaodong Chen, Zeyuan Zhang, Meng Yang, Min Zhong", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06641-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06641-5", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.024614252098274836}, {"title": "Infrasound Array Dataset of the 2021 Eruptive Paroxysms of Etna Volcano", "authors": "Luciano Zuccarello, Duccio Gheri, Silvio De Angelis, Araceli Garcia-Yeguas", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06638-0", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06638-0", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.026652620096112578}, {"title": "A new, long-term root zone soil moisture dataset for operational agricultural drought monitoring over Africa", "authors": "Ross I.

In-person deep canvassing is the gold standard for durably changing attitudes on polarizing topics. However, door-to-door canvassing is costly, and many populations may not be feasibly reached in this manner. Campaigns are already conducting outreach using digital tools, including text messages and social media. If appropriately trained agents messaging over social media can achieve a fraction of the effect of in-person canvassing, canvassing may be scaled up to achieve large overall impacts at lower costs. Scripts used in this application are based on those used by transgender allies in the original study. To personalize messaging, the conversational agent uses natural language processing to detect conversational topics, and shares relevant pre-scripted messages of information and third-person experiences, encouraging respondents to engage in perspective-taking with respect to an outgroup. This study demonstrates the potential of automated social media messaging for deep canvassing, with possible applications by governments, public health agencies, and political organizations. Estimated effects are positive and significant under covariate adjustment and reweighting; due to important differential attrition, partial-identification bounds are also reported and include zero.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251414926", "doi": "10.1177/20531680251414926", "journal_full": "Research & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012202246638419068}, {"title": "From Flowers to Fascism?

Through quantitative analysis of over 200,000 Tumblr posts and qualitative coding of about 2350 Tumblr posts, we did not find evidence of an explicit radicalization. We found that problematic Tradwife posts found in the literature may be confined to Tradwife-only spaces, while content in the Cottagecore tag generally did not warrant extra moderation. However, we did find evidence of a mainstreaming effect in the overlap between the Tradwife and Cottagecore communities. In our qualitative analysis, there was more interaction between queer and Tradwife identities than expected based on the literature, and some Tradwives even explicitly included queer people and disavowed racism in the Tradwife community on Tumblr. This could be genuine, but we propose that this is an example of mainstreaming, where white supremacists re-brand their content and follow platform norms to spread ideologies that would otherwise be rejected. In addition, through temporal analysis, we observed a change in the central tags used by Tradwives in the Cottagecore tag pre- and post-2021. Initially, these posts focused on aesthetics and hobbies like baking and gardening, but post-2021, the central tags focused more on religion, traditional gender roles, and homemaking—all of which align with white supremacist rhetoric about womanhood.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251413920", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251413920", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.14576681556363535}, {"title": "“When and Where [We] Enter…”?

We posit that awareness of the race-gender positionality of African American women, as well as the unique positionalities of other marginalized African American subgroups, is critical to understanding the conditions under which Black Americans embrace LGBTQ+ rights and communities. Using the Black respondent subsample of the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Study, we test the extent to which intersectional theories explain African American cross-group consciousness with LGBTQ+ persons and support for LGBTQ+ rights and communities. In doing so, we distinguish multiple mechanisms through which identity intersections affect African American 1 political attitudes, and we find that, though intersecting marginalized identities can be critical to fomenting African Americans’ support for the rights and concerns of LGBTQ+ communities, not all intersections lead to a more inclusive Black politics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10044", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10044", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06813397402014376}, {"title": "Ingroup Favoritism?

Drawing on social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, the study explores ingroup favoritism and identifies key predictors of individual-level bias.

Results show that intergroup bias is prevalent, particularly in the form of ingroup favoritism for positive traits. Analyses reveal that strong ethnolinguistic identity and perceived intergroup threat significantly predict higher levels of bias, while language identity, Finnish language proficiency, and intergroup contact show no consistent relationships. These findings suggest that even in socially stable and egalitarian contexts, perceived threats to group identity can sustain intergroup bias.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10053", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10053", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03488590263759073}, {"title": "Black Embodied Political Subjectivity", "authors": "Lahoma Thomas", "abstract": "Drawing from an interpretivist framework, this paper proposes Black Embodied Political Subjectivity (BEPS) as a conceptual framework that foregrounds the body, affect, and historical memory as critical to political subjectivity.

Rather than treating the body as an inert vessel or secondary site of politics, BEPS argues that the body is central to the ways Black people negotiate, contest, and reconstitute power in lived political contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10046", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10046", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009702658856924007}, {"title": "“Steel Dragon City, shifting Chinese migrants”: Chinese communities in suspended motion in Dubai", "authors": "Xiaofeng Han, Haichao Wang", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-026-00521-y", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-026-00521-y", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9649966164713947}, {"title": "Poor Neighborhoods, Bad Schools?

While disgust evolved primarily to promote the avoidance of pathogens (pathogen disgust), it is also expressed toward moral violations (moral disgust). In this study, we investigated whether vocalisations of pathogen and moral disgust are acoustically distinct and whether listeners can differentiate between them. We conducted machine learning analyses of acoustic parameters and two preregistered listening experiments (all conducted in 2023) to test these questions. Based on a dataset of 1000 spontaneous disgust vocalisations, six machine learning classifiers with 5-fold cross-validation were able to accurately distinguish between pathogen and moral disgust vocalisations (AUC = 0.73). In a listening experiment (n = 200), participants differentiated between the two types of disgust vocalisations above chance levels. In a second listening study (n = 680), listeners rated pathogen disgust vocalisations as expressing stronger avoidance motivations in the expresser and as sounding more negative than moral disgust vocalisations. Together, these findings demonstrate that pathogen and moral disgust vocalisations are both acoustically and perceptually distinct.

In this bibliometric analysis we analysed author keywords from 4,313 journal articles, published between 2004 and 2024, from two sources: 1) key environmental psychology journals (Journal of Environmental Psychology, Environment and Behavior, PsyEcology: Bilingual Journal of Environmental Psychology, Frontiers in Psychology: Environmental Psychology, and Global Environmental Psychology) and 2) other journals where authors explicitly provided ‘environmental psychology’ as an article keyword. Using VOSviewer software, we produced maps of a) co-authorship and country collaborations; and b) author keyword co-occurrences to visualise topic clusters overall (2004-2024) and in discrete time periods (2004-2008, 2009-2013, 2014-2018, and 2019-2024). Co-authorship networks tended to relate to specific topics, with limited evidence of collaboration across topics or between authors in the Global North and South. Keyword co-occurrence mapping revealed eight overarching topic clusters: human–nature relationships; children’s experiences of environments; virtual environments; pro-environmental behaviour; neighbourhood and built environment; place attachment; stress and wellbeing; and climate change. We observed a significant expansion in research on pro-environmental behaviour and climate change within environmental psychology, and a decrease over time in the visibility of research on the built environment.

More specifically, we test whether serious games can influence individual opinion formation on complex issues, such as the energy transition, arguing that the immersive nature of a serious game may be more effective than conventional information treatments in triggering learning effects and ultimately influencing opinion formation. Based on our results, we show that playing the game did not, on a general level, produce any significant effects on either efficacy or policy support.

Drawing on population-wide Norwegian register data, we analyze how children of mixed origin fare in education compared to children of two immigrant parents, using their native majority peers as a reference. When it comes to educational achievements, we find that children of mixed origin are located between a disadvantaged second generation and the native majority. However, once parental SES is accounted for, the second generation exhibits significantly higher achievements, revealing an advantage that is absent among children of mixed origin. When it comes to educational ambitions, the second generation is advantaged in both absolute and relative terms and, once again, we find no such advantage among children of mixed origin. There are essential variations across country backgrounds. Still, the overall pattern suggests that while children of mixed origin ‘catch up’ to natives in terms of educational achievements, they lose their ‘edge’ vis-à-vis the second generation, particularly in terms of ambitions.

We further test whether explicitly naming Google in the invitation affects participation. In line with prior work, younger individuals were more likely to opt in and complete the study. Gender differences were limited to willingness, and no systematic variation by education was observed. Naming Google in the invitation affected willingness, but not completion. Notably, we examine participation by party vote, contributing to a better understanding of participation by political leaning. Voters of the Green Party were more willing to participate and together with FDP voters, also more likely to complete the donation, controlling for age, gender, and education.

This paper argues that the dominant bottleneck in realizing value from surgical robotics is not clinical capability but managerial unpreparedness. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory, high-reliability organization principles, and dynamic capabilities frameworks, we propose that surgical robotics should be conceptualized as a complex adaptive system requiring coordinated governance across six interdependent domains: strategic oversight, financial management, workforce configuration, operational integration, risk and liability structures, and data governance. We introduce the Robotic Surgical Administrative Readiness (RSAR) framework to guide organizational assessment and strategic planning. Synthesizing recent literature on surgical robotics integration, the paper concludes that failures in robotic surgery will increasingly be managerial failures, and that healthcare technology management must evolve from a support function to a strategic governance role.

This Perspective offers a behavioural explanation for this paradox. We argue that disjoint evaluation regimes operating at different levels of the scientific system generate a stable but epistemically inefficient equilibrium. Author-level evaluation is largely neutral with respect to publication volume, whereas journal-level evaluation is sensitive to output volume through denominator-based performance indicators. This structural asymmetry reshapes selection behaviour. Using a minimal illustrative model, we show how variance-sensitive editorial evaluation predictably suppresses high-uncertainty contributions while favouring low-risk, centrally aligned work. The resulting equilibrium gives rise to a constellation of behavioural adaptations, including upstream fragmentation, editorial conservatism, suppression of epistemic outliers, and convergence in both scientific content and narrative form. Unlike accounts centred on funding scarcity or individual risk aversion, this framework explains selective convergence as an outcome of routine evaluation dynamics rather than exceptional pressures or misconduct. By focusing on selection geometry rather than individual motivation, the Perspective provides a unifying interpretation of persistent patterns in contemporary scientific production and communication.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj2kf_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/tj2kf_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006315603223313482}, {"title": "Revisiting the Relationship between Marriage and Childbearing in East Asia: The Role of Fertility Desires in Japan", "authors": "Fumiya Uchikoshi, Ryota Mugiyama, Shohei Yoda, James M. Raymo", "abstract": "In this study, we propose and evaluate a new framework for understanding “lowest-low” fertility in East Asia, emphasizing the link between the desire for children and marriage. Recognizing that delayed and declining marriage is the primary reason for low fertility in the region, we posit that marriage decisions are shaped by intentions or incentives (not) to have children. We evaluate this hypothesis using Japan as a case, a society where parenthood is an integral part of the “package” of normative family expectations accompanying marriage, especially for women. After confirming that attitudes toward marriage and fertility are strongly correlated, we estimate discrete-time hazard models of first marriage using nationally representative longitudinal data. We find that, net of marriage desires, (1) women and men with no desire to have children marry significantly later than those who desire children, and (2) uncertain attitudes toward parenthood are also associated with later marriage for men, but not women. The link between negative or uncertain fertility desires and delayed marriage among men is partially explained by their lower engagement in efforts to find a marriage partner. These results provide insights for policy discussions about declining fertility in East Asia, especially concerns that pro-natalist policies are mistargeted.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5e8m_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/k5e8m_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.03273928053499753}, {"title": "Beyond Decline: A Proof-of-Concept Application of Social-Ecological Systems Analysis to UK Grassroots Music Venues, 2014–2025", "authors": "Mike McLeod", "abstract": "The UK grassroots music venue sector contracted by 16% between 2014 and 2025 (960 to 810 venues), with closures accelerating to 125 venues in 2023 alone. Existing research fragments this crisis across economic analyses, policy inquiries, and single-mechanism explanations (gentrification, licensing, financing), obscuring potential systemic dynamics. This paper explores whether Ostrom’s Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—developed for natural resource commons—can provide integrative analytical capacity for cultural infrastructure challenges. Drawing on longitudinal data from Music Venue Trust annual reports (2014–2025), parliamentary inquiries, and case studies, I operationalize the SES framework’s core subsystems (resource systems, resource units, governance structures, actors) for the music venue context. The analysis suggests two potentially reinforcing feedback mechanisms: (1) a gentrification dynamic where venues create cultural value captured by property owners, leading to displacement; and (2) a touring circuit collapse where venue loss reduces route viability, accelerating further closures. Preliminary threshold estimates suggest regional touring viability may collapse below approximately 700 venues, though substantial uncertainty surrounds these projections. Governance analysis using Ostrom’s design principles reveals critical apparent failures in proportional benefit-sharing (venues subsidize £162 million annually while receiving negligible returns from the £8 billion upper-tier industry) and rights recognition (93% operate as short-term tenants). Scenario modeling—calibrated to available data but subject to significant parameter uncertainty—suggests that financial interventions alone may delay but not reverse decline, while combined financial and structural reforms could potentially shift trajectories toward recovery.

Building upon the integrated ecological framework for popular music studies established in Waxing Ecological (McLeod, 2024), this work translates ecological theory into a structured analytical protocol. I adapt and operationalise Elinor Ostrom's Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework—including its core subsystems, multi-tiered variables, and design principles for commons governance—to model the complex interdependencies characterising urban music ecologies. The methodology integrates insights from Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) theory to account for non-linear dynamics, emergence, and feedback. It provides researchers and policymakers with a replicable, stepwise process for system mapping, variable identification, resilience assessment, and the design of adaptive, polycentric governance strategies. While demonstrated through the critical problem of small venue sustainability, the framework is designed as a flexible diagnostic toolkit for a wide range of problem sets within cultural ecosystems, moving decisively from ecological metaphor to rigorous socio-ecological analysis.

However, almost immediately after the attacks, celebrations of the pogrom and protests against Israel broke out in cities around the Western world. The author argues that the upward sweep of antisemitism witnessed since 10/7 cannot be satisfactorily explained in terms of radicalization or simplistic stage models. By definition, radicalization is an increase in extremist attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral intentions relative to default societal norms. Thus, the radicalization hypothesis implies that the output of radicalization (in this case, antisemitism) is not normalized. This is unambiguously contradicted by evidence collected from Jewish victims of antisemitism before and after 10/7. Taken together, the evidence indicates that antisemitism has been renormalizing long before 10/7 and it is that process which set the preconditions for its explosive rise witnessed after 10/7. There is a danger in misattributing the current wave of antisemitism to radicalization as such explanations can inadvertently serve to minimize the breadth and severity of the problem.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dw6nx_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/dw6nx_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.06602749711035116}, {"title": "Populist Science and the Discursive Politics of “Make America Healthy Again”", "authors": "Norah MacKendrick", "abstract": "In the United States, the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement has captured public attention.

To answer this question, this paper systematically examines the discursive politics of MAHA’s political arm by analyzing official government communications published during the first year of the second Trump administration.

By constructing a dichotomy between “good” and “captured” science MAHA rhetorically consolidates control over what counts as legitimate expertise. MAHA’s political discourse strategically ignores peer-reviewed evidence linking chronic disease to social inequality, racism, and economic disparities, revealing MAHA’s alignment with nationalist, anti-regulatory politics.

The concept of geopolitical risk is conventionally defined as the direct result of political incidents, war, and international tensions. The current study argues that the concept should be understood in a more structural and sustainable manner, relating to the underlying forces driving geopolitical risk. The main research question is whether and how the three pillars of the ESG factors contribute to the explanation and understanding of cross-country and over-time variations in geopolitical risk. In an effort to avoid the information losses associated with the aggregate nature of the ESG index, the three factors are considered separately and the three pillars are analyzed individually. The empirical context is a balanced cross-country panel data set including 42 countries over the 2000-2023 time period. The data for the three factors is obtained from the World Bank dataset in an effort to standardize and compare the data in a cross-country and cross-time manner. The GPR index is used to measure the level of geopolitical risk and is defined by Dario Caldara and Matteo Iacoviello. The GPR index captures the level of geopolitical tensions based on the analysis of media signals. The combination of the three sources allows for the direct connection and correlation between the three factors and the internationally recognized GPR index. The paper uses an integrated methodological approach that combines the results from three different approaches. The first method uses panel data analysis in an effort to identify the average marginal effects while controlling for unobserved heterogeneity. The second method uses the technique of clustering in an effort to identify structural patterns and divide the countries into groups based on their unique characteristics and risk profiles. The third method uses machine learning regressions and nonparametric analysis in an effort to capture the complex relationships and interactions in the data. The three-step method is used for each pillar in an effort to ensure consistency and comparability. The results suggest that the three factors contribute to the GPR index in a unique manner. The environment and energy structure contribute to the GPR index as a risk multiplier, the social factor is related to the exposure to instability, and the governance factor is a central stabilizing factor.

Sound translation methodology, including the use of adequate personnel, is seen as crucial for reaching this goal (Harkness 2003). Recommended methodology should be empirically backed and stay tuned to latest developments, such as machine translation. Against this backdrop, to investigate the potential effect of varied translators’ backgrounds and machine translation on the statistical properties of surveys, we conducted an experiment in which an English questionnaire was translated into German by 16 professional translators and 16 social scientists; translations were subsequently fielded in web surveys. We introduced two translation conditions: translation from scratch and post-editing (machine translation corrected by a human translator). To investigate the quality of the survey data from these 32 translation versions (approx. 250 responses each), we use standardized mean distance and Cohen’s d with the official translation as a benchmark. We have four key findings: First, the resulting statistical means of the survey items vary, sometimes substantially, across translations. Second, post-editing is associated with a reduced gap between the survey data from the experimental questionnaires and the official translation, and it also lowers the variability among different translations. Third, when translating from scratch, social scientists are more likely to produce translations leading to statistical outliers of survey data. Fourth, post-editing can lead to systematic bias for both social scientists and professional translators if translation errors made by the machine are not identified and corrected. This study highlights to what extent decisions concerning the choice of translators and the integration of machine translation can impact the statistical properties of survey data.

We find that corrective information consistently elicits heightened negative emotions (e.g., anger, frustration, anxiety) and suppresses positive emotions (e.g., happiness, enthusiasm).

It argues that Yugoslavia’s collapse stemmed not from a simple state breakup but from the interaction of complex ethnic configurations, deep economic crisis, and nationalist mobilisation by political elites, especially hardline Serbian nationalism which shattered federal cohesion and made Bosnia and Herzegovina’s multiethnic landscape a focal point of violent contestation and international concern. Comparing Slovenia and Croatia, where ethnic homogeneity, limited territorial objectives, and early international recognition facilitated relatively short conflicts, with Bosnia, where highly mixed populations and overlapping territorial claims produced protracted, all‑out war, the paper shows why Bosnia required full‑scale external intervention. Humanitarian and strategic crises such as the Sarajevo siege, the Srebrenica massacre, and mass displacement exposed the powerlessness of traditional UN peacekeeping and the ineffectiveness of diplomacy without credible force. The study then traces how fragmented and militarily unsupported early initiatives by the UN, EU, and the United States gradually gave way, under the pressure of changing battlefield dynamics, sanctions, domestic politics in Western states, and U.S. congressional pressure to a more unified Western strategy that combined military pressure with coercive diplomacy. It highlights the decisive role of active U.S. engagement, which shifted from conflict management to conflict resolution and leveraged the interests of Milošević, Tuđman, and Izetbegović to push negotiations forward.

It examines how fear, identity mobilisation, and narrative simplification function not merely as distortions of rational policy-making, but as instrumental resources through which institutions legitimate authority, mobilise resources, and coordinate behaviour under conditions of perceived systemic transition. Drawing on political psychology, international relations theory, and strategic studies, the analysis proceeds in three steps. First, it identifies recurrent cognitive and social patterns that tend to become salient under uncertainty, including worst-case reasoning, in-group consolidation, narrative dominance, and ambiguity reduction. Second, it examines how these patterns may be amplified to serve specific institutional objectives, such as emergency legitimation, deterrence signalling, and the normalisation of structural change. A contemporary illustration drawn from transatlantic tensions over Greenland is used to clarify how cross-domain linkage between security and economic instruments can accelerate these dynamics within alliance systems. Finally, the paper advances a theoretical synthesis spanning classical and contemporary war theory. It proposes that while the political nature of war identified by Carl von Clausewitz remains analytically relevant, its dominant mode of operation has increasingly shifted toward what is termed cognitive governance: the management of fear, expectations, and legitimacy at the population level.

Background: Across heterogeneous late-modern societies, fertility has converged to sub replacement levels. Existing explanations emphasize shifting values, gender norms, social policy, or diffusion mechanisms, but they pay less attention to how non-parenthood becomes both communicatively legitimate and structurally probable. Luhmannian systems theory offers tools to analyze how increasing functional differentiation reshapes the conditions under which reproduction is decided and coordinated. Method: The article develops a conceptual model informed by Luhmannian systems theory. It examines how intimate interaction systems are structurally coupled with economic, educational, legal, political, and medical systems, and how these couplings generate temporal desynchronization between individual reproductive windows and institutional time. The analysis synthesizes demographic trends and policy debates to illustrate the argument. Results: Functional differentiation decouples intimacy from multifunctional family roles and makes reproduction structurally optional. As temporal misalignments deepen, the probability of successful coordination for childbearing decreases, especially under high educational and career demands. Because family policies operate as programs within other systems’ binary codes, their impact remains modest and context-dependent and cannot fully re-synchronize divergent time structures.

Drawing on data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), linked with district-level information on local labor markets (NUTS-3), we apply logistic regression models to explore gendered patterns of STEM aspirations. Findings show that boys are more likely to aspire to STEM careers in local contexts with a high prevalence of STEM occupations, which is mainly due to increased aspirations for non-academic STEM careers. By contrast, girls’ career aspirations do not significantly vary with local STEM prevalence, even in local contexts with relatively high shares of women employed in STEM. These results suggest that STEM-intensive local labor markets reinforce gendered patterns of STEM aspirations, especially among adolescents oriented towards non-academic career paths.

The relative student's position in the classroom hierarchy, net of her absolute performance level, raises the probability of enrolling in the academic track, the expectation of university enrolment, and levels of academic competencies. We observed that boys and students from lower SES backgrounds, who typically have weaker academic standings, are more responsive to their placement in the TISH. Some of these effects seem to stem from the influence of TISH on some socio-emotional skills.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jevdr_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jevdr_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00874135515534602}, {"title": "The economics of climate adaptation optimism", "authors": "Matthew G.

We combine theoretical and empirical analyses to show that adaptation—especially via economic development—is actually often the dominant driver of climate-sensitive societal outcomes, especially on smaller space and time scales. This aligns adaptation with markets and governance incentives. For these reasons, widely studied climate-sensitive outcomes such as crop yields, affluence, and damage and death rates from climate-related hazards have broadly and steadily improved over the past several decades, as have indirectly climate-sensitive outcomes such as mortality from violence and self-harm. These improvements provide important context to recent pessimistic studies of adaptation that focus on outcomes’ marginal sensitivities to climate. They also underscore the importance of economic development to human well-being, and they suggest that economically costly climate policies could harm climate-sensitive outcomes.

Second, it examines how political regimes affect the tenure of ministers, demonstrating that dominant-party regimes exhibit the most stable cabinets, while personalist dictatorships are characterized by high turnover, with military regimes and democracies displaying similar patterns.

Findings indicate that while minor hurricanes have little effect on crime, major hurricanes cause significant increases in property crime. In the decade following exposure to major hurricanes, property crime rates rise by 8.5% relative to the baseline mean, imposing an estimated per-capita social cost of $120 on treated counties. These effects are largely driven by evacuation orders and selective out-migration in the short run and by declining per-capita incomes in the long run. Furthermore, hurricane effects are disproportionately larger for counties with less disaster experience and lower incomes, which risk losing 1.4% and 2.2% of per capita GDP, respectively, due to hurricane-induced crime.

This study presents a data-informed institutional analysis of how industrial bioengineering is recognized within professional qualification systems by combining a comparative review of international qualification frameworks with quantitative analysis of membership statistics from Japan’s Professional Engineer system. The review indicates that bioengineering is most often positioned primarily within biomedical engineering, while comprehensive qualification categories encompassing genetic engineering, cell engineering, and industrial bioprocess engineering, such as those institutionalized in Japan, are rarely explicitly articulated at the international level. Moreover, analysis of division-level data across 20 engineering disciplines in Japan further shows that organizational engagement, measured by organization rates, exhibits a negative but statistically non-significant association with division size. This trend suggests that in large divisions where holding the qualification itself provides practical advantages, such as preferential evaluation in public procurement, incentives for active participation in professional organizations may be relatively weaker. In contrast, smaller divisions display greater variability in organization rates and appear more sensitive to qualitative institutional factors. Within this context, the biotechnology division is distinctive, exhibiting both the highest organization rate (59.4%) and the highest female representation (13.4%) among all divisions. These characteristics are consistent with the nature of industrial biotechnology, a field characterized by rapid technological advances and persistent ethical, safety, and regulatory challenges that require continuous human interaction and collective professional governance.

Parenting leave policies constitute a key pillar of social sustainability, with demonstrated relevance for gender equality, labour market participation, health, and child well-being. While European research on parenting leave has expanded significantly over recent decades, the available evidence remains fragmented and uneven. Drawing on a narrative review of more than 400 publications from 24 European countries, this report maps which dimensions of inequality have been most extensively studied and identifies where substantial blind spots persist across countries, social groups, and levels of analysis. The review shows that research has focused predominantly on gender, particularly mothers’ employment trajectories and fathers’ take-up of leave. By contrast, other crucial dimensions of inequality, including health, disability, well-being, citizenship, ethnicity, non-standard employment, and diverse family forms, remain marginal in the literature. In addition, most studies implicitly centre on parents in stable, standard employment, resulting in limited evidence on the experiences of precarious workers, the self-employed, migrants, and low-income families. These biases restrict the capacity of current research to evaluate whether parenting leave policies reduce inequalities broadly or primarily benefit already advantaged groups. The report makes a central contribution by systematically linking policy design features (eligibility rules, benefit levels, individualisation, flexibility) with policy outcomes (leave take-up and longer-term inequality effects) and by highlighting the need for more intersectional, multi-level, and comparative research. It demonstrates that although a gender lens remains central to parental leave policies, future research should adopt a broader perspective to examine how multiple inequalities intersect. Strengthening data infrastructures, improving the measurement of leave use, and integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches are essential for advancing policy-relevant evidence. Policy recommendations emphasise the importance of inclusive parenting leave designs that accommodate diverse employment trajectories, ensure adequate income replacement, and support individual entitlements for both parents. The report also underlines the need for systematic monitoring of the EU Work–Life Balance Directive, not only in terms of legal compliance but with regard to its distributional effects across social groups and countries. By identifying where evidence is missing, this report provides a strategic agenda for future research aimed at improving the inequality-reducing potential of parenting leave policies in Europe.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8kbsz_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8kbsz_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.021682227534268406}, {"title": "Trekkers’ Experience and Sustainable Behaviour in the Annapurna Region: Examining Role of Satisfaction and Guiding Practice", "authors": "Ankit Thapa", "abstract": "Mountain tourism in Nepal has expanded rapidly, particularly in the Annapurna region, raising concerns about environmental pressure and the sustainability of trekking practices. While trekkers’ experience has often been linked to satisfaction and pro-environmental behaviour, empirical evidence from Himalayan contexts remains limited.

This study examines the relationship between trekkers’ experience, satisfaction, and sustainable behaviour in the Annapurna Conservation Area (ACA), Nepal, using empirical survey data. A quantitative, causal-comparative research design was employed, drawing on primary data collected from trekkers through a structured questionnaire administered in situ. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, multiple regression, and mediation testing. Findings indicate that trekking experience is positively associated with both satisfaction and sustainable behaviour. However, satisfaction does not demonstrate a statistically significant mediating effect between experience and sustainable behaviour in this dataset (Sobel test, p = 0.1205).

The study contributes to debates on sustainable mountain tourism by highlighting the importance of experience quality and governance mechanisms rather than satisfaction alone in shaping responsible behaviour.

Pain and irregular bleeding were commonly framed as routine, leading many participants to interpret persistent or severe symptoms as normal variation. For those with diagnosed gynecological conditions, this misrecognition delayed care-seeking and contributed to prolonged diagnostic timelines. Limited menstrual health knowledge also shaped early clinical encounters, reinforcing reassurance and dismissal.

Accuracy was higher in the congruent condition than in the incongruent one, indicating that the visual analyzer divides the digit string into triplets in the “standard” manner. Critically, this congruency effect was found not only when the participants read the numbers as syntactically-structured number names (“twelve”), but also when they said each number as a syntax-less series of digit names (“one, two”), i.e., triplet-grouping is not a top-down effect arising from the syntactic properties of the current verbal response.

Practice-based interventions are therefore urgently needed to support people living with food insecurity and obesity to access and afford healthier and sustainable foods.

Methods: We recruited seven UK senior supermarket nutritionists who represented 85% of the UK grocery market share. We used semi-structured interviews and analysed the data using a reflective thematic analysis approach. Results: Supermarket nutritionists perceived that their business did prioritise health and environmental sustainability for customers. However, there were several challenges encountered when trying to promote healthier and more sustainable food in the supermarket environment, including profitability concerns, unpredictability of intervention outcomes, control over own-brand products, perceived intention-behaviour gap, and a belief that they are already implementing affordability interventions.

Lastly, supermarket nutritionists raised the need for an operationalised definition for sustainable food products. Conclusions: Affordability interventions to support customers to purchase healthier and more sustainable food require supermarkets to consider multiple challenges.

The current study examines talker differences in perceived emotion for a database of talkers producing clear and conversational speech. Method: A database of 41 talkers was used to assess talker differences in six emotion categories (“Anger”, “Fear”, “Disgust”, “Happiness”, “Sadness”, and “Neutral”). Twenty-six healthy young adult listeners rated perceived emotion in 14 emotionally-neutral sentences produced in clear and conversational styles by all talkers in the database. Generalized linear mixed-effects modeling was utilized to examine talker differences in all six emotion categories. Results: There was a significant effect of speaking style for all emotion categories, and substantial talker differences existed after controlling for speaking style in all categories. Additionally, many emotion categories, including anger, had significant talker x style interactions. Perceived anger was significantly higher in clear speech compared to conversational speech for 85% of the talkers. Conclusions: While there is a large speaking style effect for perceived anger, the magnitude of the effect varies between talkers. The perception of negatively-valenced emotions in clear speech, including anger, may result in unintended interpersonal consequences for those utilizing clear speech as a communication facilitator. Further research is needed to examine potential acoustic sources of perceived anger in clear speech.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/nxecy", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/nxecy", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013862891192599869}, {"title": "Family Trajectories, Current Social Connections, and Loneliness in Later Life: A Life-Course Analysis of the 1958 British Cohort", "authors": "Maria Sironi, elisa tambellini, Bruno Arpino", "abstract": "Loneliness poses significant health risks for older adults, comparable to smoking and obesity. While research has examined concurrent factors like partnership status and health conditions, few studies adopt a life course perspective to understand how family histories during adulthood shape loneliness in later life.

Our analyses use prospective cohort data, which allow us to measure variables – including early-life confounders – at multiple phases of the life course, rather than relying on retrospective (and potentially biased) recall. Specifically, using cohort data from the National Child Development Study, we analyze adults born in 1958, employing sequence and cluster analysis to identify typologies of family trajectories, and regression models to assess associations between these trajectories and loneliness outcomes at ages 61-66. Additionally, we explore the role of current social connections in reducing loneliness. By accounting for the interplay of family-life experiences, this research provides novel insights into how the timing and sequencing of family transitions influence emotional well-being in older age, showing that those following less standard trajectories are at higher risk of perceiving loneliness.

But causal judgments are also tricky, especially when complex causal structures are involved, such as joint production, omissive causation and double prevention. Cognitive science has demonstrated that people are more likely to pick factors as ‘causal’ when they make a difference for the outcome across a range of counterfactual scenarios, with the scenarios sampled based on their statistical and prescriptive normality. We propose that this makes causal judgements susceptible to motivated reasoning, and ingroup favouritism in particular. We hypothesize that people will be less likely to assign causal efficacy and responsibility for counternormative outcome to groups they support, and that the bias will be greater for more complex causal structures. We test these propositions in a pre-registered survey experiment run on quota-based representative sample in Poland. The context of the experimental vignettes is a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We find that in all scenarios respondents assign significantly higher causal power and responsibility to the attackers when the attackers are Russian rather than Ukrainian, consistent with our theory and the very high levels of public support for Ukraine in Poland. Contrary to our expectations, responsibility of the attackers is not significantly lower when they hit a public building as a result of defending combatants moving there rather than when unprovoked. Unexpectedly, in a scenario where the civilians get killed after moving to where the defenders are, the defenders get a higher share of the blame when they are identified as Ukrainian rather than Russian.

Methods The IMEA consists of 15 brief scenarios, describing each of the MEAs, divided into three categories: positive, negative and incomplete MEAs. The scenarios are followed by questions about frequency of experiencing MEAs within and outside of meditation, and at will. Ninety-seven participants with meditation experience completed the IMEA together with a measure recording characteristics of their contemplative practice and established self-reports of decentering, psychological wellbeing, mindfulness, meditation depth and personality. Results Meditators experienced positive MEAs most frequently. Hours of meditation practice and retreat experience were significantly positively correlated with the majority of the positive MEAs. Positive MEAs were significantly more frequently experienced in meditation and negative MEAs outside of meditation.

Remembering rather consists in the construction of a representation about a scenario, previously experienced, through the interaction of minimal traces with acquired statistical regularities. A minimal trace merely constitutes a causal link to the experience but possesses no trans-temporally transmitted representational (viz. categorical and compositional) content. Our proof of principle uses a neuro-computational model that is based on an autoencoder modeling the visual pathway and a transformer modeling the semantic information network. It assumes the hippocampus as the host of minimal traces. Our model demonstrates that minimal traces, which lack sufficient information for the reliable categorization and composition of content on their own, can be enhanced through interaction with semantic information.

From a sustainable wellbeing perspective that emphasises intergenerational equity, we examine how wellbeing was reallocated across age groups in 28 OECD countries between 2008 and 2024. Method: We analyse life evaluation (0–10 scale) data from the Gallup World Poll at four anchor years (2008, 2011, 2019, 2024), using country-specific models and two classification approaches (quadratic and confidence-interval-based). We assess cross-national heterogeneity, methodological sensitivity, and sustainable wellbeing implications through age-group reallocation patterns. Results: Age-wellbeing profiles varied greatly across countries, with classifications sensitive to functional form, age boundaries, and temporal pooling. We identified five patterns: (1) sustainable (8 countries including Eastern Europe, East Asia, Chile: broad-based gains across all age groups), (2) unsustainable (14 countries across North, Western and Southern Europe, North America, and New Zealand, characterised by early-adulthood decline alongside substantially better outcomes in late adulthood; Spain exemplified the starkest contrast (-1.34 point-change for ages 18-29, and +0.83 for ages 70-79)), (3) no significant age-based reallocation (Turkey, Israel), (4) reverse patterns (United Kingdom, Ireland: late adulthood fared worse than early adulthood), (5) mixed/unique patterns (Australia, Denmark). Conclusion: Age-wellbeing profile classifications are sensitive to methodological choices, though reallocation patterns provide robust evidence about distributional dynamics. Half the sample showed unsustainable trajectories, raising profound intergenerational equity concerns. Eight countries achieved sustainable, broad-based gains, all starting from low baselines, which suggests that equitable trajectories may be more easily achievable when aggregate wellbeing is improving rather than declining.

Fitch, Peter Kvam", "abstract": "Procrastination, where people engage with an immediately rewarding task when they should work on a task with a delayed payoff, is typically framed as self-regulation failure or lack of motivation. We challenge this view by demonstrating that procrastination emerges naturally from the computational intractability of sequential resource allocation under temporal uncertainty. When time horizons are certain, humans approach mathematically optimal strategies for balancing competing tasks. However, when deadlines are uncertain -- requiring integration over exponentially growing outcome spaces -- participants systematically over-invest in immediate rewards early, then attempt to compensate too late. Critically, this temporal signature of deviation from optimality predicts individual differences in self-reported procrastination independently of overall task performance. Using machine learning to relate behavioral patterns across 24 conditions of a sequential resource allocation task to validated self-report measures, we show that procrastinators exhibit a specific timing dysfunction: being suboptimal early when optimal policy prescribes work -- not merely performing worse on average. These findings reframe procrastination as bounded rationality under computational constraints rather than pure irrationality, suggesting that interventions targeting uncertainty reduction or temporal scaffolding may prove more effective than exhortations to increase motivation or willpower.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/trkv9_v3", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/trkv9_v3", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00299638855280282}, {"title": "Examining the Signal-Detection Account of Visual Working Memory", "authors": "Yiou He, David Kellen, Henrik Singmann", "abstract": "The study of visual working memory has long centered on debates between Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and discrete-slots models. A notable limitation of these debates is the strong reliance on parametric assumptions and selective-influence manipulations that rarely receive direct test. Here we take a different approach by examining whether visual working-memory judgments satisfy the structural constraints implied by a random-scale representation—a general latent-variable framework from which both SDT and discrete-slots models can be derived. In Experiments 1a and 1b, multiple-alternative forced-choice judgments conformed to these constraints, allowing the reconstruction of single-item ROC functions without response-bias manipulations. The reconstructed ROC functions were curved and asymmetric, contradicting the linear predictions of discrete-slots accounts. Experiment 2 provided a complementary failure case, showing that random-scale constraints break down precisely when their theoretical conditions are not met. Experiment 3 extended the findings to item-location bindings in change detection, again yielding an asymmetric ROC function that neither equal-variance SDT nor discrete-slots models can accommodate.

This white paper proposes a conceptual framework for Loopback Cinema, an emotion-adaptive narrative paradigm in which a film continuously reshapes its storytelling trajectory based on the inferred viewer affective state. Loopback Cinema is conceptualized as a closed feedback loop between viewer emotional response and narrative generation, where affective signals serve as implicit inputs to a dynamic scene-selection process. The framework introduces the notions of continuous affective sensing, narrative state spaces, and loopback-driven scene orchestration, positioning cinema as a responsive system rather than as a linear artifact.

Through qualitative scene analysis, the research examines the interplay between musical elements—including staccato strings, dissonant harmonies, and rhythmic pacing—and Hitchcock’s visual techniques, such as framing, camera movement, and editing rhythm. The findings demonstrate that Herrmann’s score functions not merely as accompaniment but as an active mechanism for directing attention, sustaining suspense, and eliciting cognitive and emotional responses.

Drawing on historical folklore, cultural archetypes, and psychological theory, the study examines how environmental and narrative cues evoke anticipatory anxiety, attentional focus, and embodied cognitive responses in readers. The methodology integrates literary analysis, folklore scholarship, and cognitive psychology to map the processes through which narrative suspense and sensory description guide emotional, perceptual, and decision-making responses. Particular attention is given to the interplay between memory, expectation, and sensory integration, emphasizing how the anticipation of threat shapes cognition and behavior. The paper situates the Headless Horseman within a broader psychological and symbolic framework, exploring his role as a projection of communal fear, social anxiety, and shadowed aspects of identity. Through the lens of Jungian depth psychology and contemporary threat-processing research, the Horseman archetype is analyzed as both a cultural artifact and a cognitive trigger, demonstrating how folklore leverages human attentional biases, pattern recognition, and predictive processing to elicit suspense and fear. Literary descriptions of Sleepy Hollow’s nocturnal environment are treated as structured stimuli, where auditory, visual, and spatial cues interact with reader expectation to produce measurable anticipatory responses. By synthesizing folklore, historical context, and cognitive theory, this work illustrates how narrative and environmental patterns can shape affective experience, decision-making, and learning. It highlights how cultural stories, while entertaining, function as cognitive scaffolds that train attention, pattern recognition, and emotional regulation in response to threat. This approach bridges literary scholarship, psychology, and cognitive science, offering a model for understanding the enduring power of suspenseful folklore and its role in shaping perceptual and emotional engagement. The analysis underscores the relevance of these findings for contemporary education, narrative therapy, and media studies, suggesting that immersive storytelling can serve as both a cultural and cognitive tool.

Francis", "abstract": "This narrative review examines the psychological mechanisms underlying fear, uncertainty, and anticipatory cognition in Japanese horror folklore, drawing on tales such as Ringu, Ju-on, and Noroi. These narratives generate sustained suspense through minimalistic and ambiguous sensory cues—whispered sounds, flickering thresholds, and unseen presences—that engage perceptual systems and cognitive expectations, providing a rich context for exploring the architecture of human anxiety. Integrating frameworks from depth psychology, including Jungian interpretations of the Shadow, with contemporary cognitive neuroscience, Japanese horror functions as a model for investigating how the mind responds to unresolved threats, ambiguity, and environmental uncertainty. Narrative structures create a feedback loop in which anticipatory attention heightens perceptual sensitivity, amplifying emotional arousal, and facilitating selective encoding of threat-relevant stimuli. Such dynamics illustrate principles of predictive coding: the mind continuously generates hypotheses about potential dangers, and ambiguous cues trigger recursive simulations of threat scenarios, producing sustained psychological tension. Psychophysiological responses align with sympathetic activation, heightened vigilance, and modulation of memory consolidation, highlighting the potential of folklore narratives to serve as naturalistic laboratories for studying affective regulation and cognitive anticipation. Beyond fear, Japanese horror engages themes of existential uncertainty, boundary dissolution, and moral ambiguity, offering a symbolic space in which repressed anxieties, unintegrated psychic content, and shadow material can be externalized and negotiated. These narratives reveal mechanisms of attention, emotion regulation, and threat appraisal that may inform experimental and clinical psychology. Folklore thus emerges as both a cultural artifact and a psychologically resonant system, demonstrating how immersive narrative experiences shape cognitive-affective processes. By synthesizing narrative, psychological, and cognitive perspectives, the review underscores the translational value of folklore for research: Japanese horror provides a structured yet immersive paradigm for examining environmental ambiguity, cognitive anticipation, and emotional response, offering pathways to study stress, trauma, and adaptive coping strategies within controlled narrative contexts.

Drawing on data from the China Africa Research Initiative, International Telecommunication Union, World Bank, and UNESCO covering the period 2000-2024, the research employs spatial analysis and comparative case studies of Ethiopia, Kenya, and Ghana to assess the impact of China's Digital Silk Road initiative. The theoretical framework integrates Heeks' concept of data justice and the Bass diffusion model to examine both instrumental access (physical connectivity) and structural capacity (educational outcomes). Findings reveal a significant positive correlation between Chinese ICT loans and internet penetration rates, but a weaker connection to educational indicators such as the Human Capital Index and tertiary enrollment. The analysis identifies a persistent and evolving urban-rural digital divide, with connectivity concentrated in capital cities and economic centers while rural areas remain largely disconnected. Case studies demonstrate that state-led models (Ethiopia) produce slower educational gains despite substantial investment, while market-led (Kenya) and e-government (Ghana) approaches show more promising results when combined with existing institutional capacity. The research identifies three critical challenges: the debt-education trade-off whereby loan repayments crowd out educational spending, digital sovereignty concerns related to surveillance infrastructure, and the \"leapfrog illusion\" that assumes technology can substitute for foundational educational development. The study concludes that while Chinese investment has successfully built Africa's digital backbone infrastructure, it has inadvertently reinforced spatial inequalities and failed to generate proportional improvements in human capital, particularly in rural areas.

This research examines linguistic differences between real news and LLM-generated fake news headlines across four dimensions: toxicity, sentiment, moral framing, and lexical similarity. Using prompt engineering, we created five datasets of AI-generated fake news headlines (∼22,000 each) and compared them with a dataset of real news headlines of the same size. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated fake news are more toxic, negative, and subjective, and rely more heavily on authority-based language. To verify the effectiveness of these linguistic features, we conducted classification experiments using two state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4o-mini and GPT-5-mini) under zero-shot, few-shot, and linguistically guided conditions. Our results show that while zero-shot performance is modest (GPT-4o-mini mean F1 = 67.89%, GPT-5-mini mean F1 = 58.47%), both few-shot and linguistic hint approaches achieve consistent and robust improvements over zero-shot, with mean F1 scores in a similar range (≈ 70%), indicating that linguistic markers can be systematically leveraged to improve automated fake news detection.

Method: A sample of 241 NEETs (18-29 years) from the Porto Metropolitan Area completed standardised measures of stress, quality of life, perceived social support, resilience, and behavioural problems. Results: A cluster analysis revealed three distinct profiles: Psychologically Adaptive (34.0%), Moderately Vulnerable (46.5%), and Psychosocially Vulnerable (19.5%). These groups differed significantly across all psychological variables, while age and time in NEET status were not distinguishing factors. Gender, educational attainment, and involvement in the justice system emerged as key differentiating factors.

However, not all critics, and consequently their ratings, have the same relevance to the final buyer. This work designed a methodology and proposed a formulation that objectively assesses the real influence of a wine's highest rating by a critic, based on its increased online visibility, search volume, and references in digital media. Several indicators were designed to compare the influence of different critics' scores over a time horizon of one to four weeks after a wine received its highest rating.

This study examines how these socioeconomic inequalities emerge and widen across three stages of the formal early childcare access process: intention to use early childcare during pregnancy, application, and actual access during the child’s first year. Using longitudinal data on approximately 2,000 families in France, collected during pregnancy and followed one year after birth, we document a progressive widening of gaps along the access pathway. Compared with high–socioeconomic status (SES) households, low–SES households are about 18% less likely to intend to use early childcare, 25% less likely to apply, and 46% less likely to obtain access. To identify the determinants of these gaps, we combine machine learning for variable selection with decomposition analyses that quantify the contribution of observable factors at each stage across a wide range of 39 predictors. At the intention stage, most of the SES gap is accounted for by differences in observable characteristics related to resources, constraints, and available alternatives, with norms contributing little. At subsequent stages, inequalities increasingly reflect institutional barriers. The largest disparities emerge at the access stage, where spot allocation-related factors favoring higher-income, working, and earlier-applying households, and knowledge of the childcare system, account for most of the gap.

While true in many contexts, I depart from that consensus, introducing and offering a philosophical account of a social epistemic practice that I term ‘hushing-up.’ This practice has emerged organically in response and in resistance to sectarian bigotry in Northern Ireland (NI), and contributes to post-conflict transitions away from social and political polarisation and its derivative harms to individuals and collectives. In spaces where hushing-up is deployed, ignorance of peoples’ community background is intentionally cultivated as a strategy in opposition to bigotry, while bigoted or sectarian displays incur social costs. Positioning hushing-up against existing accounts of political ignorance, and contributing to the idea of an epistemology of ignorance, I distinguish between performative partisanship (involving ignorance driven by social rewards for showing group allegiance) and pressured partisanship (involving ignorance driven by the avoidance of social sanctions for displaying indicators of disloyalty to a group). On the account I defend, shifts in social norms are central to addressing some forms of harmful ignorance. I argue that hushing-up succeeds in doing this in two ways: first, by reducing the rationality of pressured partisanship by providing alternative social support to that provided in polarised social spaces such that the cost of dissent is lowered; and secondly, by disincentivising performative partisanship through increasing the difficulty of identifying targets and ensuring that bigoted displays are met with disapproval in spaces where that norm is in force.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m9j26_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/m9j26_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013378203775045283}, {"title": "Compression of visual information in redundancy masking follows grouping and segmentation", "authors": "Sabrina Hansmann-Roth, Wolf Harmening, Bilge Sayim", "abstract": "In typical scenes, the available visual information exceeds the processing limits of the visual system. To reduce information, the visual system organizes visual input according to various principles. For example, in visual grouping local elements are grouped into larger wholes. Recently, it was shown how the visual system compresses redundant information by ‘redundancy masking’ which reduces the number of perceived items in repeating patterns. For example, when three identical items are presented in the periphery, observers often report perceiving only two items. In the current study, we examined the role of grouping and segmentation in redundancy masking. In particular, we asked whether visual grouping determines –and precedes— the units in which information is compressed in redundancy masking. Stimuli consisted of arrays of 3-5 vertical lines, briefly presented in the left or right visual field. We varied the contrast polarity of the lines creating the following patterns: uniform arrays, alternating arrays, and subgroups of identical lines with a different line at the stimulus edge. Observers reported the number of lines and then indicated the perceived feature values for each reported line. Our results revealed redundancy masking in all conditions. Importantly, redundancy masking always came after segmentation and grouping: lines were masked predominantly within segmented subgroups of identical lines. The reported patterns were highly systematic, even when redundancy masking occurred: The presence/absence of the two contrast polarities (Contrast), the stimulus edge (Edge) and their ordinal frequencies (Ratio) were largely accurately reported. Hence, important stimulus information remained largely intact.

To address these questions, we measured subjective emotional experiences, physiological activity (cardiac, respiratory, electrodermal) and social attitudes in dyads of unacquainted individuals who watched videos in the presence of each other. We manipulated the emotional content of the videos and the type of shared attention between participants, to test for the contribution of interpersonal influence. The results revealed that intense emotions indexed by physiological arousal were associated with the emergence of reciprocal prosocial attitudes within dyads, and that this effect depended on joint attention.

To explain this paradox, we test competitive nutritional mechanisms. We find that adjusting for historical caloric availability yields null results, ruling out simple energy-deficit hypotheses. In contrast, adjusting for the scarcity of key macronutrients—specifically Fats and proteins—attenuates the macrosomia risk by nearly 80% at the 95th percentile.

Ethnography, and social research more broadly, must address the invisibility of action's meaning and the definitions of situation. For accessing these \"internal states\"—beliefs, meanings, values—a semiotic orientation toward reading traces, signs, clues, and minor details is essential. The specificity of this reading practice emerges through comparison with medical diagnosis, revealing a critical difference: unlike patients who collaborate in diagnosis, research participants deploy dissimulation and simulation as self-protection. Drawing on Becker's insight that participants orient performances toward more consequential audiences (superiors, peers) rather than ethnographers, and Anteby's analysis of resistance strategies, the paper demonstrates how the evidential paradigm addresses this opacity through attention to \"expressions given off\" and unwitting testimonies. The paper subsumes the evidential paradigm under abductive logic, thereby addressing Ginzburg's ostensible resistance to this framing. Ethnographic fieldwork becomes the theatre where evidential paradigm and abductive inference operate together. Following Peirce's classical definition, enriched by Walton and Eco's contributions, the paper adopts Eco's distinction of three abductive types: overcoded, undercoded, and creative. Each type is illustrated through Sherlock Holmes' adventures—Ginzburg's exemplar of the evidential paradigm—and through the author's ethnographic studies on nature sacralization in Italian communities and childhood vaccine hesitancy across seven European countries. The paper concludes that the evidential paradigm guides the ethnographer's gaze toward marginal details and unwitting testimonies that trigger abductive reasoning—the core engine of ethnographic practice.

This study assesses the spatial impact and post-rainfall recovery of the event using the U-Net deep learning architecture on daily PlanetScope satellite imagery captured on a pre-rainfall date and on a series of post-rainfall dates between 14 and 27 April 2024. Multi-temporal land use and land cover (LULC) classifications were generated using a U-Net model trained via transfer learning, and the LULC categories were water, vegetation, built area, and bare ground. The multi-temporal LULC classifications were further applied for change detection analyses to map flooded areas and track temporal recovery across LULC categories. The U-Net model for LULC classification achieved over 95% overall accuracy and a Kappa statistic of 0.927. The change detection and inundation recovery showed that approximately 23.8 km² —nearly 10 times the area of Downtown Dubai—was flooded. The flood affected the built area and bare ground most, while vegetation exhibited higher flood resilience. Although rainfall ended by April 17, 95% of flooded areas remained submerged three days later, and 37% were still underwater by day ten. These findings reveal the limitations of urban drainage systems in Dubai and the value of high-temporal remote sensing and deep learning for flood monitoring.

Yet when one examines the instruments through which this governance is being assembled—green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, collateral frameworks—one finds a different register of obligation. This article distinguishes ethics, the universalising horizon that legitimates green finance, from morality, the obligations encoded in the exchange-forms of loans, bonds, and repo collateral—covenants, eligibility criteria, step-ups, verification protocols. Drawing on Strathern's relational anthropology, it analyses these instruments as devices that perform successive cuts: operations that sever ecological relations from their context, exteriorise obligations into detachable rights, and eclipse the conditions of their production. Each cut—from loan to bond to asset-backed security to repo collateral—reassigns responsibility from situated relations to increasingly impersonal infrastructures of circulation. With Guyer, the article tracks the temporalities these instruments enact: how coupon calendars, taxonomy reviews, and collateral eligibility compress planetary futures into sequences of near-term obligations—overnight rolls, quarterly reviews, annual KPIs—privileging continuous liquidity over thick, extended commitments. Drawing on Karatani's theory of exchange-forms, the analysis reads this trajectory as a rearticulation of the capital–nation–state complex at planetary scale, asking whether green finance opens toward new forms of association or remains enclosed within the inherited trinity. The apocalyptic register of climate discourse—tipping points, runaway warming, the end of the world—is taken seriously through de Martino's distinction between apocalypse with and without eschaton. Green finance, the article argues, stages a controlled apocalypse without eschaton: existential threats are converted into review cycles, covenants, and term sheets, while the decisive moment of world-refoundation is continually deferred.

This study provides the first systematic synthesis of climate-related legislative discourse in India by examining over three decades (1993–2025) of legislative questions from the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly. Using a public corpus of 9,522 questions retrieved from the National eVidhan Application (NeVA) portal, the study applies an iteratively developed keyword-based annotation approach to distinguish between explicit climate discourse and implicit climate-relevant engagement. The findings show that explicit references to climate change are exceedingly rare, accounting for 0.06% of all legislative questions, consistent with the limited formal integration of state legislatures within India’s climate governance framework. In contrast, legislators frequently engage with climate-relevant sectors such as coal, flood, forests, and irrigation, framing these issues primarily through administrative and financial concerns rather than through climate change narratives. This pattern highlights the unrealised potential of subnational legislatures as sites of climate governance.

Internal audit, when conducted in line with international professional standards, has the potential to act not only as a control mechanism but also as a strategic partner contributing to organizational resilience and value creation. In 2024, The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) introduced the Global Internal Audit Standards, strengthening the emphasis on professionalism, independence, competence, and strategic alignment of the internal audit function across all sectors, including the public healthcare system. This article examines the challenges of applying these global standards within the Lithuanian healthcare sector, focusing on a specific regulatory requirement that mandates medical or health sciences education for the head of internal audit (the so-called internal medical audit). Through a systematic analysis of the Global Internal Audit Standards, national legislation on public sector internal audit, and sector-specific regulations issued by the Ministry of Health, the study identifies a fundamental normative tension between international audit professionalism and sectoral qualification restrictions. The article argues that internal audit effectiveness derives primarily from professional audit competencies, independence, and risk-based methodologies rather than from subject-specific clinical education. Drawing on an analogy with information technology audits, the analysis demonstrates that complex, knowledge-intensive sectors can be audited effectively through professional internal auditors who engage subject matter experts without compromising objectivity. The findings suggest that the current regulatory model risks professional isolation of healthcare auditors, reduced audit value, weakened organizational resilience, and inefficient allocation of scarce healthcare resources.
