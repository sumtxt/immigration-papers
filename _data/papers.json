Regarding the second question, it is argued that all major accounts of the wrongness of discrimination identify the usual, directly discriminatory hostile design as wrongful on account of its harmful or disrespectful character. Most accounts also consider the less common indirectly discriminatory hostile design to be possibly wrongful, especially given the severe disadvantages faced by the homeless in contemporary cities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123424000796", "doi": "10.1017/s0007123424000796", "journal_full": "British Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.04194564442817261}, {"title": "Detecting Group Mentions in Political Rhetoric A Supervised Learning Approach", "authors": "Hauke Licht, Ronja Sczepanski", "abstract": "Politicians appeal to social groups to court their electoral support.

In response to acts of aggression that undermined the newly established international order, diplomats employed contested notions of “crime” and “punishment” to characterize state behavior. In the League's debates over the first international sanctions, references to extra-legal moral principles were used to bolster both the legitimacy and efficacy of the legal regime. Since the principle of sovereign equality precluded any single state from claiming moral authority, diplomats instead innovatively portrayed the international community as a fictive agent endowed with superior moral standing. This rhetorical move helped legitimize calls for punishing aggressors. Adopting a historically informed constructivist approach, the article illuminates how conceptual transformations within the normative order unfold through diplomatic practice.

A potential sponsor, whether democratic or autocratic, is unlikely to support FNCs when doing so jeopardizes a strategic partnership with the target regime, which may retaliate against the sponsor. Additionally, democracies are particularly deterred from supporting FNCs when the target regime can retaliate economically, such as by disrupting trade or other vital economic ties. To test these arguments, we leverage data from the External Support for Non-violent Campaigns Dataset, which documents global instances of state support for non-violent campaigns from 2000 to 2014. Consistent with our theory, we find that liberal democracies make up the vast majority of sponsors, but also that geo-political alignment between potential sponsor and target regime is strongly and negatively correlated with the provision of support.

To test this, we conducted a large online survey ( N = 3108) in Brazil – a country profoundly affected by various forms of crime – using two embedded experimental protocols. Our findings show that crime exposure increases support for unlawful enforcement practices, such as police overreach and vigilante justice, while leaving attitudes toward military coups, executive aggrandizement and support for democracy as the best form of government largely unaffected. Understanding this nuanced relationship is especially important in contexts where crime is pervasive and politically instrumentalized.

Drawing on theories of information processing, I propose a model of information seeking driven by the need to resolve informational deficits, shaped by two fundamental party-level characteristics: incumbency status and programmatic change. Firstly, I expect voters to seek information more actively about opposition parties than about governing parties, as the former lack the highly visible track record of governing parties. Secondly, voters tend to seek more information when established non-governing parties undergo a significant programmatic reconfiguration. To empirically test these hypotheses, I compile a unique dataset comprising Google search data related to the main political parties of 11 liberal democracies between 2004 and 2023. The results reveal that voters consistently demonstrate a greater propensity to search for information about opposition parties than incumbent parties during election campaigns, particularly when the opposition implements substantial programmatic changes. These findings have crucial implications for understanding how voters search for political information about political parties in real-world electoral competitions and how party-level characteristics can drive this behavior.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13540688251375302", "doi": "10.1177/13540688251375302", "journal_full": "Party Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004352597553677562}, {"title": "Beyond binary: A new measure of party ethnicization", "authors": "Ahmed Hamza, Ko Maeda", "abstract": "In contrast to existing binary conceptualizations of ethnic parties, which often depend on arbitrary thresholds and/or expert judgments, we propose a survey-based continuous scale to measure the extent to which a party receives balanced or unbalanced support from a country’s ethnic groups.

We find that Trump’s activists are not simply voters responding to policy preferences or culture-war appeals but are also participants in a grassroots social movement organized around a shared perception of lost honor, declining esteem, and institutional disrespect. To make this argument we use the concept of the symbolic politics of status to explain how political conflict extends beyond contests over material distribution or moral values to include battles over whose values and lifestyles are considered worthy. For MAGA activists, reclaiming lost status means seeking public affirmation for identities they feel have been unfairly denigrated. The MAGA movement blends grievance with joy, cultivating pride, belonging, and celebration alongside anger at elites.

Housing can propagate inequality by enabling owner-occupants to use it as collateral for other investments or to secure higher returns to human capital investments through the better schools in better neighborhoods.

This appears to result from a wage bargaining system characterized by strong coordination within and across industries. This finding challenges other commonly cited explanations for Nordic income equality, such as redistribution through the tax transfer system, public spending on goods that complement employment, and public policies promoting equal skills and human capital.

Using archival research and formal econometric estimates of Colombia’s probability of default, we show that in the early 1980s Colombia’s fundamentals were not significantly different from those of the Latin American countries that defaulted on their debts. We then document that the different choice made by Colombia was due to the authorities’ belief that maintaining a good reputation in the international capital market would have substantial payoffs. We discuss how high-level political support from the US allowed Colombia to be particularly creditor-friendly and avoid an IMF program. Our counterfactual analysis shows that in the short to medium run, Colombia benefited from avoiding an explicit default. We also test whether Colombia’s behavior in the 1980s led to long-lasting reputational benefits.

The primary setting considered here is with spatially indexed data in which the dependence structure of observed random variables is characterized by a known, observed dissimilarity measure over spatial indices. Observations are partitioned into clusters with the use of an unsupervised clustering algorithm applied to the dissimilarity measure. Once the partition into clusters is learned, a cluster-based inference procedure is applied to a statistical hypothesis testing procedure. The procedure proposed in the article allows the number of clusters to depend on the data, which gives researchers a principled method for choosing an appropriate clustering level.

As a result, parties should recruit brokers who are central among non-copartisans. We combine village network data from brokers and citizens with broker reports of vote buying, allowing us to use broker and citizen fixed effects. We show that networks diffuse information about citizens to brokers who leverage it to target transfers. In particular, among those citizens who are not registered to their party, brokers target reciprocal citizens about whom they can learn more through their network, and these citizens are more likely to support the brokers’ party.

A generalized second price auction for positions endogenizes equilibrium orders and bids are driven by position externalities that impact incremental profit from switching positions.

However, there is an older, although less visible, flow of African people, mainly from Nigeria, Ghana, and Cameroon, who travel to Brazil in order to claim asylum because of their SOGI.

While international migration has long been a topic of debate, internal migrations are gaining increasing attention. Using data from China Migration Dynamic Survey, this paper pays special attention to the role of internal migration in educational attainment of the next generation. Specifically, by examining the migration-induced (non-)disruption in schooling, this study aims to control certain confounding factors and explore the role of migration timing as a potential missing link. The findings reveal that non-disruptive migration (before children aged 5) results in increased children’s schooling years for both left-behind children (LBC) and migrant children (MC). Conversely, disruptive migration tends to have no significant effects on children’s education in most cases. To bolster the robustness of these findings, an alternative sample of younger children aged 6–20 is constructed to assess potential dropout rates. Additionally, to address concerns regarding endogenous issues, we instrument the (non)disruption with the average (non-)disruption rate and the employment rate of the migration year in the hometown and destination respectively for MC and LBC. Meanwhile, propensity score matching (PSM) technique is employed to gauge the average treatment effect by comparing the disrupted and non-disrupted. The results consistently reaffirm the main findings, highlighting the importance of interventions to mitigate disadvantages associated with migration timing.

This study fills the gap by examining the use of remittances among high‐skilled, skilled and semi‐skilled returnees. Drawing on primary data from seven key informant interviews, 21 in‐depth interviews and a survey of 205 returnee migrants, the research reveals that across the skill spectrum, the majority of remittances are spent on consumption and non‐productive purposes.

Much of the existing research also analytically treats sanctuary cities the same, regardless of the individual components of a given policy.

We draw on individual city case studies to illustrate each component of the scale and then score each locality from one to seven based on a content analysis of the policy's text. We demonstrate that policies vary in the limits they place on cooperation in federal immigration enforcement and that these limits vary geographically and temporally.

This article introduces a novel framework for understanding strategic behavior in migration diplomacy, grounded in the concept of migration interdependence. It argues that state strategy is shaped not only by material power but also by the distribution of exposure to the consequences of disrupted migration flows. When stronger states are more exposed, cooperation becomes rational; when stronger states are less exposed, or when weaker states possess credible alternatives, coercion becomes viable. The article develops a two-axis typology to explain these dynamics and applies it to four bilateral labor migration corridors: New Zealand–Pacific Islands, Russia–Central Asia, Gulf States–Nepal, and Malaysia–Indonesia. These cases span Global South and South–North relationships, allowing for controlled comparison across varied structural configurations. Methodologically, the article employs a focused comparative approach combining process tracing and a structured typological framework, drawing on primary and secondary sources to triangulate evidence and elucidate variation across migration corridors. It identifies four factors that condition states’ strategic options: remittance dependency, labor market reliance, migration portfolio diversification, and institutionalization. The article advances migration studies by reconceptualizing labor mobility as a site of deliberate, strategic state engagement rather than a passive byproduct of domestic pressures. Simultaneously, it enriches international relations theory by offering a nuanced understanding of how power and migration interdependence intertwine to shape state behavior within asymmetric contexts.

Further, this measure of racial affect has a growing relationship with partisanship among Black and Latine Americans such that Democratic identification is associated with higher levels of affective differentiation.

This is particularly felt in the most diversified cities where minority groups may not have their needs catered for. This paper aims to explore the translocal halal economies that converge in the city of Lisbon and the tactics used by ordinary Muslim households to access it. Engaging with literature on cultural food adequacy, migrant infrastructures and translocalism, we argue that in this urban context—and beyond—, migrant infrastructures are a way to mobilize shared resources and overcome urban socio‐spatial inequalities. Migrant infrastructures mediate religious observance and the everyday reproduction of migrant life in the city, blurring the lines between formal and informal, religious and economic, mobile and immobile. The empirical research shows, however, that access to these infrastructures is unequal creating cleavages among Muslims along the lines of purchase power, residential patterns and urban accessibility. This differentiated access to resources is also reflected in practices that create bridges linking locales across the Muslim diasporic space at different geographical scales, ranging from the local, to the regional and to the international. Thus, through translocal and transnational practices, Portugal is also being repositioned in the halal product market chain at a global scale drawing on colonial continuities and penetration into new markets.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70098", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70098", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9552501260870868}, {"title": "Understanding Residential Mobility in Urban China: A Comparative Analysis of Hukou Residents and Temporary Migrants in Shanghai", "authors": "Zhen Li, Lei Lei", "abstract": "As an avenue toward achieving better housing conditions and meeting individual and family needs, residential mobility is critical for migrants’ integration into the host society. Previous studies have examined the levels and determinants of residential mobility of (im)migrants and local/native residents separately, but few have directly compared the levels and determinants of mobility across these two groups or distinguished residential mobility for different reasons. Using recent data from the Shanghai Urban Neighborhood Survey, this study compares the levels and main determinants of residential mobility for work, family and housing reasons between local hukou residents and temporary migrants. Results show that migrants are much more likely to move than hukou residents, especially for employment reasons. Life‐course factors have weaker impacts on family‐related moves of migrants than those of hukou residents. There are educational gradients in housing‐related moves among hukou residents but not among migrants. Household income affects migrants’ moves to meet family needs, rather than moves to improve housing quality. Furthermore, home ownership, residential crowding, and residential duration also have different influences on residential mobility between migrants and hukou r esidents.

This paper draws from the experiences of 16 displaced families of diverse ethnicities living in the UK with higher care needs related to disability, chronic illness and/or mental health, which have hitherto been overlooked. Integrating feminist ethics of care with the notion of ‘enforced transnationalism’, the analysis shows how displaced families are subjected to a continuum of migration, welfare, and social care policies over time which result in processes of family ‘nuclearization’ and immobility. Barriers to family visits and reunification compound limitations on welfare and social care support when families seek to fulfil transnational caring obligations. This increases the pressures on the middle and younger generations providing informal care and negatively affects families' relational wellbeing. Despite this, transnational families deploy resistance tactics through maintaining and re‐building intra‐ and intergenerational caring relationships and values of family solidarity to live ‘care‐filled lives’ in the places where they have sought sanctuary. The paper significantly deepens the theoretical and empirical scope of the concept of ‘enforced transnationalism’, bringing relational selves and care front and centre in studies of forced migration and transnational familyhood.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70103", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70103", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.7616298444117988}, {"title": "Intergenerational Experiences of Belonging and Place‐Attachment Amid Environmental Challenges in Regional Australia", "authors": "Julia Cook, Tamara Young, Kate Senior, Jonathan Curtis", "abstract": "Recent scholarship has turned to the concept of ‘intergenerational belonging’ and to questions about how belonging is navigated and experienced in contexts marked by environmental challenges.

It presents findings from a walking ethnography, and from two community mapping workshops conducted with members of different age cohorts. We find that, in our field site, belonging is shaped by whether one is ‘born and bred’ in the suburb or is otherwise considered a ‘blow‐in’, and that those who are deemed ‘locals’ are able to speak with authority on topics such as where the suburb ends, with this authority legitimated by their knowledge of place. However, we find that caring for and about the local environment allowed those who were not considered ‘locals’ to engage in a performance of belonging that provided them with a specific status and social role in the suburb. Ultimately, we highlight how care for and about the environment can provide a means for individuals to perform belonging, and, stemming from this environmental focus, we demonstrate how intergenerational belonging can extend beyond connections through families to also encompass broader intergenerational concerns.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70100", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70100", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014745051703579204}, {"title": "‘I Wish I Had a House Like This’ Reimaging Home: Former‐Refugee Experiences of Housing, Resettlement and Well‐Being in Australia: A Photovoice Study", "authors": "Sheenagh McShane, Karen Block, Rebecca Bentley", "abstract": "The relationship between refugee housing and well‐being extends beyond basic shelter, encompassing social, cultural and spatial dimensions.

T. Jansen, Harry J. F. M. Boumeester, Peter J. Boelhouwer", "abstract": "Global metropolises, including first‐tier Chinese cities, are confronting unprecedented challenges of talent exodus amid escalating housing costs, competitive job markets and deteriorating urban living conditions. Traditional migration theories fall short in explaining young talents' mobility decisions, as their high human capital drives them to prioritize multidimensional considerations beyond mere economic returns. This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework integrating multiple aspects of prospect theory—reference dependence, loss aversion, endowment effects and risk attitudes—to investigate young talents' settlement intentions through logistic regression analysis of survey data from 1065 professionals across Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Guangzhou. The research reveals that migration decisions are fundamentally shaped by asymmetric psychological evaluations: young talents demonstrate heightened sensitivity to potential losses in job prospects and housing affordability. Institutional and psychological endowments significantly enhance settlement intentions: homeownership, local hukou status and public sector employment increase staying probability, along with longer duration of residence and stronger place attachment. Notably, our findings reveal nuanced suppression effects of migration‐specific risk attitude on one's general risk attitude: while first‐tier cities attract individuals with higher general risk tolerance who are willing to embrace urban challenges, these individuals also tend to have higher migration‐specific risk tolerance, which in turn reduces their long‐term settlement intention. These insights not only advance behavioural economic understanding of talent mobility in urban areas, but also provide practical guidance for metropolitan governance. Our findings suggest that effective urban talent retention requires cities to strengthen institutional ties and guarantee stable career development rather than relying primarily on economic incentives. This approach ensures cities maintain the human capital essential for innovation and competitiveness in an era of increasing inter‐urban competition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70099", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70099", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.4112268599783867}, {"title": "Infrastructure deficits and informal settlements in sub-Saharan Africa", "authors": "Luís M.

Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially generated collective behaviors.

Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data are available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our minimal hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation–integration transition even with memory-less agents. While residential segregation is a multifactorial phenomenon, this physics analogy suggests a simple mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood’s population leads to a rapid demographic shift.

At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed.

Many studies have been devoted to understanding the driving factors of IMC, providing static empirical evidence on the characteristics of cooperating municipalities. This article contributes to the literature with a dynamic analysis of the drivers of cooperation, using a Cox proportional hazards model over a long period and a very large sample of municipalities in Catalonia. This dynamic analysis unravels the direction of the causal relationship in complex relationships such as fiscal restrictions or political legitimation with cooperation. Furthermore, as we have data from eight relevant local services, we improve both the theoretical and empirical analysis of cooperation dynamics based on the characteristics of the services.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0143814x25100718", "doi": "10.1017/s0143814x25100718", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013089542665711384}, {"title": "Creative Discretion on the Frontline of Public Services: A Longitudinal Qualitative Digital Diary and Interview Study", "authors": "Liesbeth Faas, Glenn Houtgraaf, Peter Kruyen, Sandra van Thiel", "abstract": "“Creative discretion”—defined as street‐level bureaucrats' use of their discretion to generate novel and useful ideas for customizing services to meet the needs of service users, superiors, and themselves—is vital as governments shift from traditional public management to a more user‐centered approach, emphasizing responsiveness over technocracy.

In China’s “forbidden zone,” where state-imposed taboos are intuitively understood but constantly shifting, avoidance is largely habitual—students perceive politics as dangerous and irrelevant, frame patriotism in apolitical terms, or engage in activism discreetly to avoid repression. After migrating to the US “landmine zone,” where political taboos are decentralized, scattered, and socially enforced, these tactics evolve—students pretend to be apathetic to sidestep ideological pressure, downplay nationalism to prevent conflict, and confine activism to trusted circles to evade peer, institutional, or transnational consequences.

Despite reaching higher levels, they have received less attention than other gender inequalities, such as gender wage gaps. More generally, research typically focuses on selected sets of life course summary measures, predominantly the employment duration, to explain gender inequalities across the life course. This oversimplifies gender-specific life courses in particular. Taking a life-course perspective and using data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe for the Netherlands and West Germany, I propose an innovative combination of machine learning, sequence analysis, and decomposition techniques, allowing for a new perspective on gender inequalities over the life course. The study disentangles which specific life-course elements are most relevant for pension inequalities and quantifies the role of gender-exclusive life-course experiences for gender disparities. I find that the duration, timing, order of life-course events, and overall life-course complexity matter for pension income inequalities in both pension systems. Specifically, the duration, timing, and order of care work experiences are more crucial pension predictors than the employment duration, which has been the primary focus of previous research. This holds for the GPGs: the largest shares are attributable to gender-exclusive life-course experiences because of the lack of a male counterpart for female engagement in care work, which is poorly rewarded in pension systems. Future research and policymakers will benefit from considering such gender-specific combinations of life-course experiences for the gender pension gap and other inequalities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf143", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf143", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007531363766297705}, {"title": "Review of “Black Culture, Inc.

This paper applies the regulatory intermediation framework to assess whether third-party assurances, especially those provided by the European New Approach to Technical Harmonisation and Standards, effectively provide assurances, including digital assurances, compared to centralised, state-led authorities. It addresses three key questions: (1) Who are the regulatory intermediaries providing assurance for digital services under the New Approach? (2) How does reliance on these intermediaries differ across three regimes, specifically, the Medical Device Regulation, certifications under the General Data Protection Regulation, and the regulation of high-risk AI under the AI Act?

This paper utilises document analysis, expert interviews, and stakeholder workshops to identify four key intermediary groups involved in standard setting and conformity assessment, and maps how the three regimes assign responsibilities to them to provide assurances to varying degrees. The paper then demonstrates how intermediaries perceive the strengths and weaknesses of these third-party assurances compared to centralised state-led assurances.

Previous research has tended to view technocratic attitudes as rather one-dimensional; I show that there are in fact two distinct forms – authoritarian and democratic. The results of the study are relevant from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. Technocratic governance thus represents, in the eyes of part of the population of the CEE region, a way of solving the problems of democratic governance.

Focusing on the UK, this paper argues these findings can be reconciled by decomposing the heterogeneous effects of housing affordability into distinct, but related, housing crises. Furthermore, it argues these crises will be related to political preferences through the interaction between geography and tenure. The paper hypothesises that homeowners in areas of high house prices will be less likely to hold populist political preferences due to a wealth effect that legitimises the existing socio-political system. By contrast, social renters in unaffordable areas will be more likely to support populism due to their higher likelihood of experiencing housing insecurity and as the scarcity of affordable housing will provide a conducive context in which to scapegoat immigrants. Analysis using data on local housing conditions and political preferences finds broad support for these hypotheses. The analysis finds that social renting in an area of widespread housing insecurity is positively associated with both opposition to immigration and voting for the Reform Party. It also finds that homeownership does negatively interact with local house prices in predicting attitudes to immigration, but the effect is to attenuate the positive association between house prices and opposition to immigration. This contradicts previous studies which may have been subject to omitted variable bias. No evidence is found for an interaction between homeownership and affordability in predicting support for the Reform Party.

We provide theory and evidence to address this question by analyzing two U.S. allies with pre-existing processes of executive aggrandizement: Israel and Turkey. We argue that the decline in U.S. pro-democratic pressure has enabled autocratization in both countries; however, the causal mechanisms and degree of U.S. “autocracy promotion” differ depending on two domestic factors. The first factor is political leaders’ pre-existing control over the state. When incumbents face domestic institutional constraints, the decline of U.S. democratic promotion can actively enable the dismantling of these constraints and transform into autocracy promotion. The second factor is domestic attitudes toward the United States. When public attitudes are pro-American, illiberal political leaders can leverage U.S. support as part of their domestic legitimation strategy. By contrast, in anti-American societies, leaders practice what we call “managed incoherence,” in which a leader’s anti-American narratives coexist uneasily with U.S. acquiescence to autocratization. We demonstrate the theory in Israel and Turkey, two U.S. allies with differing levels of incumbent control over the state and contrasting public attitudes toward the United States. We find that in both Israel and Turkey, the retrenchment of U.S. democracy promotion has enabled autocratization, but through different causal pathways.

The paper argues that the far-right's attack on linguistic diversity represents a broader strategy of cultural warfare aimed at imposing homogeneous national identity through the negation of minorities. Drawing on Elinor Ostrom's framework of public goods, the paper critiques Catalonia's language policies that have treated Catalan as a 'public good', arguing this approach may have inadvertently weakened the language's social vitality. Instead, the paper proposes conceptualising minority languages as 'common goods' requiring active community participation and multilevel governance for sustainability. While acknowledging the relevance of post-democracy theories from Rancière, Crouch, and Habermas in other contexts, the paper contends that the Spanish case cas be best described as a democracy with an oligarchic matrix. Through historical analysis of Spain's political transition, particularly the roles of figures like Torcuato Fernández-Miranda and external actors such as Henry Kissinger, the paper shows how the transition established enduring connections between political power and corporate/financial elites. The paper concludes that Spain's democratic system, characterised by privileging private elite interests within public spaces without adequate accountability mechanisms, constitutes what can be labelled as a 'democracy of idiots'—drawing on the original Greek meaning of 'idiōtēs' as someone concerned primarily with private rather than public interests.

In contemporary Poland, the politics of memory have emerged as a key site of national identity formation and political legitimacy. The Law and Justice Party (PiS) has emerged as a pivotal political force in shaping historical narratives, rendering collective memory a tool of governance, a means of exclusion, and a device for populist mobilisation. While attempts to post-communist European memory politics have continued to rise, comparative, digital, and discourse analyses of how mnemonic narratives evolve within the same political party over time remain rare. This thesis examines how PiS has served as a \"mnemonic warrior\" during the 2015 and 2023 election campaigns by analysing how narratives of victimhood, betrayal, and national purity are constructed, reinterpreted, and disseminated through both traditional and new media. Using a mixed-methods design combining Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) and Digital Ethnography, the study examines party manifestos, media coverage, and social media accounts. The research employs the Discourse-Historical Approach to CDA and uses tools such as 4CAT and Zeeschuimer for gathering and analysing online material. Through examination, clear consistency in PiS's practices of memory is identifiable, and these hinge upon selective victimhood, elite delegitimisation, and historical revisionism. But the 2023 campaign demonstrates an intensification of digital approaches, particularly on X (formerly Twitter), where previous stories are re-authored in emotive, moralising, and exclusionary narratives aimed at constructing a closed memory community.

Using a geospatial approach, we show that ward-level census nonresponse is highly correlated with electoral abstention despite abstention being about five times more common than initial census nonresponse. Statistical modelling demonstrates strong common roles for deprivation and English-language speaking in driving the participation rates of a ward. Meanwhile relatively specific effects are shown for cohabitation in driving census response, and the proportion of young people in driving voting behaviour. We conclude that the similarity between these nonresponse processes represents an opportunity for improving practice in increasing response rates.

Our analysis reveals four distinct regimes determined by demand uncertainty and market concentration. In highly uncertain, competitive markets, minimum RPM enhances efficiency by encouraging inventory holding. However, in markets with lower uncertainty or more concentrated retail sectors, maximum RPM better promotes competition by mitigating double marginalization. The effectiveness of each RPM type depends on whether retailers optimize for all demand states or focus primarily on high-demand scenarios. These findings suggest that antitrust authorities should evaluate RPM cases by considering both the level of demand uncertainty and the degree of retail competition, as different market conditions may call for different forms of vertical price restrictions.

Each round earned for up to 40 points, but average performance varied across three treatments, with means of 16.6, 20, and 23.3 points. The main question was whether this manipulation would result in the sample appearing overconfident, underconfident, or well-calibrated. The results suggest that calibration depends on the relative position of mean performance to the midpoint of the range. When the mean aligned with half of the range maximum, participants appeared well-calibrated. A lower mean resulted in apparent overestimation, while a higher mean led to apparent overplacement. Experience shifted some estimates toward the actual mean and improved calibration, but only when feedback was not overly noisy. Monetary incentives and gender were controlled for but showed no significant effect on estimation accuracy. This study provides evidence that the one-half heuristic—the tendency to estimate at half the maximum of a given range—can mechanically bias confidence judgments. While further research is needed to confirm its effect in more traditional overconfidence tasks, caution is warranted when interpreting studies in which mean performance deviates from the range midpoint.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jbh7g_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jbh7g_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006697401314844864}, {"title": "Exploring the role of age structure in regional population change of the Visegrad Group", "authors": "József Lennert, Csaba G.

However, their acceptance, use and associated benefits are not equally distributed across society. While existing research has mainly focused on traditional socioeconomic indicators, broader sociological influences, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of these inequalities. Yet, too little is currently known about how these forms of capital relate to individuals’ intentions to acceptance and use digital health technologies. Objectives: This study aimed to: (1) identify distinct subgroups of individuals based on their acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health; and (2) examine how these subgroups differ in terms of economic, cultural, social and personal capital. Methods: We used cross-sectional data from the LISS panel (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences), including data from the LISS Core Study on health, economic situation, and social integration and leisure. To supplement this data, we conducted an additional online survey in November 2023 via the LISS panel to assess participants' acceptance and use of digital technologies to support their physical health. The final sample included 1,096 participants. We applied three-step Latent Class Analysis to identify subgroups based on constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Post hoc comparisons were used to characterize the subgroups based on 22 indicators of economic, cultural, social and personal capital. Results: Five subgroups were identified: neutral users (43.8%), uninterested users (21.4%), engaged users (20.6%), resistant users (9.3%) and enthusiastic users (4.8%). The largest group, neutral users, neither fully adopted nor rejected digital technologies to support their physical health. Higher levels of economic, cultural and social capital were generally associated with greater acceptance and use of digital health technologies. However, personal capital showed a different pattern: neutral users reported low self-confidence despite moderate use, while resistant users reported high self-image despite low acceptance and use. This suggests that personal capital does not always align with traditional predictors of digital engagement. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the need to move beyond socioeconomic indicators when addressing digital health inequalities. Broader factors, including economic, cultural, social and personal capital, should be considered when developing strategies to promote equitable acceptance and use of digital health technologies across society.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4bevh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/4bevh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.012311452962866065}, {"title": "Psychosocial Impact of OTT Platforms on Young Adults", "authors": "Sakshi Singh Bais ", "abstract": "Films and web series have unknowingly become a significant part of our lives.

Existing research is split over the question of whether translation flows are driven by literary, economic, political, or cultural factors. The forces that stratify countries into centers and peripheries are thus debated. To advance the debate, this study leverages newly collected data on N = 147,443 translations of literary works to reconstruct the network of translation flows between 32 European countries for the time period from 2018 to 2020. The relative impacts of literary prestige, economic infrastructure, state support, and cultural proximity on translation flows are estimated with Generalized Additive Models and the Quadratic Assignment Procedure. Results indicate that translation flows are best explained by a combination of literary prestige and economic infrastructure. Translations flow from countries with high literary prestige and a strong publishing infrastructure to countries with little prestige and weak infrastructure. The transnational circulation of literature appears as a game in which economic infrastructure confers power and in which the accumulation of literary prestige is the ultimate stake. This suggests a logic of competition in which translations are the medium through which economic power is converted into symbolic recognition. In this view, the market logic and the artistic logic are not contradictory orientations but different steps in ongoing accumulation processes.

We find that, though higher levels of Sub-Saharan African ancestry predict higher likelihoods of approval and classification as Black, even individuals with low levels of such ancestry are likely to have their self-identification validated by respondents, consistent with the practice of hypodescent. Furthermore, ancestry treatment effects are primarily mediated by perceptions of the integrity of the individual’s self-identification, suggesting that respondents believe there exists an underlying legitimate and honest way to identify that is partially based on one’s GAT result. However, we also find that the aspects that affect approval and evaluations differ from those that affect classification; the ways that respondents selectively integrate different sources of information, including ancestry, occurs via a dual appraisal and classification process which we term racial contextualism.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8tnrk_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8tnrk_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.08949407503655893}, {"title": "PARENTAL NARCISSISM AND THE SOCIAL REPRODUCTION OF EMOTIONAL CONTROL A Comprehensive Analysis of Intergenerational Transmission Mechanisms and Their Sociological Implications", "authors": "Juan Pereira", "abstract": "This paper examines parental narcissism as a mechanism of social reproduction, focusing on how emotional control is transmitted across generations within family systems. Moving beyond individual pathology, the analysis situates narcissistic parenting in broader sociological frameworks that include Bourdieu’s concepts of habitus and capital, Foucault’s theories of discipline and biopower, and feminist scholarship on gendered emotional labor. The study argues that parental narcissism constitutes a form of “emotional capital,” whereby children internalize patterns of control, surveillance, and conditional validation that shape their adult relationships, institutional participation, and social positioning. The paper traces the historical emergence of narcissistic family structures within the rise of the nuclear family, capitalist economies, and gendered divisions of labor, showing how these contexts intensify parental strategies of emotional governance. It highlights how mechanisms such as gaslighting, triangulation, and conditional acceptance become embedded as durable dispositions—what may be termed an “emotional habitus”—that reproduce hierarchical social orders. Attention is given to the intersections of class, gender, and culture in shaping narcissistic parenting strategies, as well as to sites of resistance where children and adults develop counter-strategies against domination. Contemporary digital platforms and shifting family forms are also considered as new arenas of emotional control and reproduction.

But segregation is a complicated causal treatment: what do we mean when we appeal to a world in which segregation does not exist? One could take societal contexts as the unit of analysis and compare across societies with differing levels of segregation. In practice, it is more common for studies of segregation to take persons or households as the unit of analysis within a single societal context, focusing on what would happen if particular individuals were counterfactually assigned to social positions in a more equitable way. Taking this latter framework, this paper shows how to study segregation as a cause. The first step is to theorize a counterfactual assignment rule: what would it mean to assign people to social positions equitably? The second step is to identify the causal effect of those social positions and simulate counterfactual outcomes. The third step is to interpret results as the impact of a unit-level (rather than society-level) intervention. A running example and empirical analysis illustrates the approach by studying the causal effect of occupational segregation on a racial health gap.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x9evk_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/x9evk_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.22954693019353922}, {"title": "The 12 Dimensions of Wellness: A Framework for Healing, Justice, and Systemic Transformation", "authors": "David H.

This article introduces the 12 Dimensions of Wellness: a justice-rooted, community-informed framework that incorporates four essential yet underrepresented domains in mainstream literature: creative, cultural, digital, and the newly defined carceral wellness. Carceral wellness, introduced here for the first time, is defined as a relative state of immunity to, resilience from, or recovery after the physical, psychological, social, and systemic harms imposed by carceral systems. It reflects both the enduring impacts of criminalization and the capacity to construct life-affirming alternatives. Grounded in lived experience and participatory insight, this framework offers a culturally situated and structurally aware reconceptualization of interdimensional wellness.

Yet, Indigenous women, particularly women of the age who are starting families, face profound challenges related to mental health and substance use. These challenges are rooted in historical trauma, ongoing discrimination, systemic racism, and chronic underfunding of mental health and substance use services, and result in significant gaps in access to care. Family-based home visiting has the potential to address multiple types of mental health and substance use concerns in a way that is more accessible and culturally acceptable. However, to date, there are no empirically supported family-based home visiting interventions designed to specifically to address these concerns in Indigenous communities. Family Spirit Strengths is a culturally tailored intervention developed to help fill this gap. Methods: This study is a Hybrid Type I Effectiveness-Implementation randomized controlled trial with the primary goal is to test the effectiveness of Family Spirit Strengths (FSS) at reducing poor mental health days, symptoms of depression, anxiety, and substance use, among N = 188 primary caregivers across three diverse Tribal settings and contexts. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive FSS or a beneficial control, an evidence-based nutritional support program. FSS is a transdiagnostic secondary-prevention intervention that was adapted from the evidence-based Common Elements Treatment Approach. The FSS intervention consists of 4-16 lessons (average 6-8 lessons), tailored to participant needs, delivered weekly or bi-weekly by a trained home visitor. Primary outcomes will be measured 6-9 months post-enrollment. We will also seek to characterize heterogeneity and mechanisms of FSS effects by using mixed methods and exploring moderators and mediators of impact. We will also estimate FSS costs, cost-effectiveness, and budget impact. Discussion: Serious mental health and substance use issues have long been challenges home visitors encounter with few tools to help, beyond screening and referral to clinical services, which are often hard to access if available at all. This has been particularly true when working with Indigenous families due to the profound mental health and substance use inequities they face.

Questa tesi analizza tale mutamento: il passaggio da un paradigma competitivo basato sul posizionamento in SERP a un modello fondato sulla \"logica della risposta\" diretta. Dopo aver analizzato la SEO tradizionale, lo studio si incentra sull'impatto dei \"motori di risposta\" (es. AI Overviews di Google, ChatGPT). Grazie ad architetture come il Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), questi sistemi non si limitano a indicizzare il web, ma lo sintetizzano per offrire soluzioni immediate. In tale contesto, la visibilità organica cede il passo alla necessità di \"essere scelti\" quale fonte autorevole per la generazione della risposta. Si esaminano quindi le discipline emergenti, come l'Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) e la Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). L'indagine mostra come la visibilità generativa premi la qualità intrinseca e la \"citabilità\" semantica di un contenuto, spesso a prescindere dal suo ranking tradizionale. La discussione finale affronta le implicazioni più ampie, ovvero strategiche, professionali ed etiche, di questa trasformazione. In un contesto sempre più dominato da automatismi, ma anche esposto a rischi reali di bias e disinformazione, emerge un punto cruciale: l'etica non è più soltanto un principio da rivendicare, ma si configura come un vero e proprio vantaggio competitivo.

This article aims to examine civil servants' work effectiveness in implementing WFH during Covid-19 pandemic in Sleman Regency, with a case study at the Department of Social Service. This research uses an exploratory case study approach, emphasizing the exploration of a phenomenon such as WFH policy. Furthermore, semi-structured interviews and literature reviews were used to obtain reliable data analysis. The findings of this study show that the adaptation of civil servants in the Sleman Social Service to the WFH policy is seen as complex in several divisions, because they are not accustomed to working in a home environment where teleconference facilities may be urgently required and the dependence on communication and coordination between employees is crucial. Another issue is that in the Department of Social Service there are no sanctions for civil servants who do not work under the guidance of WFH policy. In addition, knowledge and skills needed to operate and administer online services are still limited, affecting civil servants' ability in delivering a community’s public service needs.

Reidsma, Amanda Henry", "abstract": "Fire is a key component of human technology, but when and how we first developed the ability to use and create fire remains heavily debated. Some argue that control of fire developed early and quickly became an essential tool for cooking food, based on morphological changes that first appeared in Homo erectus. Others emphasize the lack of widespread and consistent traces of fire in the early archaeological record, and argue that control of fire came relatively late, post 500ka. In looking for archaeological evidence for fire use, most studies focus on the co-occurence of fire traces and other signs of human activity (e.g., stone tools, cut-marked bones). This assumes that our ancestors first focused on the idea of the hearth, either bringing the fire back to the activity area, or performing activities near a spatially-constrained fire. However, recent research has highlighted the potential importance of intentional burning of landscapes as a tool that could similarly provide nutritional and energetic benefits to the earliest hominin fire users. If landscape burning was the first type of intentional fire use, then we should not expect the co-occurrence of fire traces and other signs of hominin activity. Inspired in part by Wil Roebroeks’ emphasis on off-site activities and longstanding interest in fire, here we provide a suggestion for a new approach to explore the archaeological record for evidence of intentional landscape burning.

The application takes as a case study @foodqood, a food content creator based in Italy who gained megainfluencer status (with over 23 million followers on TikTok) and analyses the creator’s whole production on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. The framework is structured along four analytical semiotic layers, i.e., the resources of the subject matter (food), the embodied and disembodied resources of the creator’s performance, the video-specific visual and auditory resources, and the resources in the paratext. The semiotic layers are considered by intertwining three dimensions of analysis, i.e., the creator’s trajectories through time, across the different social media platforms of their online presence, and in the interactions with followers. The findings show distinct phases in the creator’s development of practices, from experimentation to institutionalisation, and trace trajectories of the creator’s identity performances marked by distinctive strategies in the combined use of the three layers of semiotic resources; the development of these through time, across spaces and in relation to followers’ prompts reveals the creator’s shifting interests in terms of audience reaches, as well as a nuanced effort to appeal to different audience segments.

Applied to Liverpool City Region as a policy case study, the framework integrates advanced spatial analysis techniques with stakeholder informed weights, to assess the suitability of postcodes for new pedestrian crossings. Site suitability scores are generated which reflect both the considerations relevant to key stakeholders, as well as the distribution of controlled pedestrian crossings, road traffic collisions, urban amenities and census-derived vulnerability indicators. The results reveal significant spatial inequalities where, specific locations with high socio-demographic vulnerability also experience the greatest road safety risks and poorest access to pedestrian crossings, despite proximity to essential services. The framework successfully pinpoints priority locations where road safety and spatial inequality concerns compounded negatively, providing evidence-based guidance for data-driven, stakeholder-informed pedestrian infrastructure investment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z456t_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/z456t_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02602425437184941}, {"title": "POLKE: A system for comprehensively annotating pedagogically-oriented grammatical structure use in language production", "authors": "Nelly Sagirov, Xiaobin Chen", "abstract": "Analysing a speaker’s language, in particular their usage of certain vocabulary and grammatical structures, can give insights into their linguistic abilities and cognitive competence. Traditional approaches to characterising language production typically incorporate linguistic complexity metrics, which, while useful for various tasks such as learner proficiency evaluation and text readability assessment, have limited pedagogical relevance. There have been calls for more fine-grained annotations of linguistic structures in recent research, particularly in the field of second language acquisition (SLA), where grammar is a central part of second language (L2) learning. However, there is a lack of comprehensive tools for systematically analysing detailed grammatical structures. To address this gap, we present POLKE (Pedagogically-Oriented Language Knowledge Extractor), a tool for automatically annotating English grammar use based on the English Grammar Profile (EGP). In this paper, we introduce the POLKE system and outline the results of its evaluation, which yielded satisfactory results.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zyxw3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zyxw3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01768628372085046}]
