We challenge this assessment on empirical and theoretical grounds. Theoretically, we provide a new typology for assessing citizen competence.

Empirically, we show that recent research, focused primarily on Americans but with some analogues in other regions, significantly undercuts common worries about citizen competence.

It focuses on the experience of several European countries before, during and immediately after WWII, a period of intense political turbulence in which citizens were subjected to both right- and left-wing dictatorships, where repression was often embedded in systems of governance. While many individuals collaborated with the repressive regimes, others resisted them, creating long-term variation in state-citizen relations across Europe.

We argue that the timing of capitalism's establishment relative to authoritarianism affects the extent of state capture by business and the regime's stance towards labor. When capitalism preceded authoritarianism, autocracy arose from a “crisis of capitalism” in flawed democracies, either from fear of communist redistribution or backlash against neoliberalism in post-communist countries. These governments appealed to business and labor interests for electoral survival. Conversely, when authoritarianism preceded capitalism, late industrializing states with weak business and working classes pursued developmental agendas by exercising autonomy over capital and repressing labor. Understanding these historical pathways to authoritarian capitalism provides insight on contemporary democratic backsliding and right-wing populism in the U.S. and Europe.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5129/001041525x17560617497388", "doi": "10.5129/001041525x17560617497388", "journal_full": "Comparative Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.003946675299704827}, {"title": "From Maoism to MAGA: Embracing Democracy with Authoritarian Imprints", "authors": "Sibo Liu, Shouzhi Xia, Dong Zhang", "abstract": "Right-wing populism, notably Trumpism, has presented a formidable challenge to democracy.

Status is often thought of as a destabilizing force in world politics, as its pursuit so often pushes states toward violent and financially wasteful policies of social aggrandizement. But this belief elides two points: that the status order and its rules of membership and esteem are malleable and subject to change; and that the emergence of different and new status symbols can also push status-seeking toward more prosocial outcomes. Rather than see these changes as occurring through explicit normative transformation, however, I argue that the status order is most likely to change surreptitiously when entrepreneurs can graft new status symbols onto an order’s underlying tenets, thus concealing but also producing change. I apply this grafting theory to the climate crisis in arguing that (1) highly visible steps taken to effect the green-energy revolution can be legibly grafted onto the existing status order; (2) this grafting technique was already evident in the Biden administration’s increased framing of the climate as an arena of status competition against China; and (3) in an era of renewed great power rivalry, status competition may at least compel states to make the kinds of costly and needed investments in climate mitigation they eschewed earlier.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0020818325100805", "doi": "10.1017/s0020818325100805", "journal_full": "International Organization", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019389671825855936}, {"title": "International State Building and Civilian Preferences: Experimental Evidence from Liberia", "authors": "Cameron Mailhot, Sabrina Karim", "abstract": "While often described as a unified process imposed by external actors on weak, conflict-ridden countries, international state building increasingly comprises a variety of actors involved in different ways in (re)building a diverse set of institutions.

We then examine how variation along each dimension impacts civilians’ state-building preferences with two rounds of original survey experiments fielded in Liberia. We find that Liberians largely prefer state-building processes overseen by a subset of international actors; that they prefer state building focused on security-oriented institutions over non-security-oriented institutions; and that different forms of involvement in the process meaningfully influence their preferences.

However, groups that represent multiple interests are often plagued by infighting and low cohesion, as members disagree about which issues to prioritize. We contend that radical Islamist groups are more likely to recruit with more diverse claims than other rebel organizations. This is because radical Islamist organizations attempt to unite diverse interests through a shared religious identity and use disparate grievances to promote the idea that Islam is under threat. Moreover, the frequent adoption of transnational identities by radical Islamist groups often places them in conflict with local, regional, and international actors, widening the scope of organizational grievances.

To answer this question, we conducted a preregistered survey experiment measuring how support for affordable housing in the U.S. varies at different distances from where respondents live (one-eighth of a mile away, two miles away, or in their state). Our results indicate that correcting stereotypes about affordable housing and misperceptions about its effects increase support for affordable housing.

However, electoral processes also serve as focal points in which right-wing political parties can adopt a negative (or xenophobic) discourse against immigrants and other minority groups in order to obtain political benefits (i.e. more electoral support). Left-wing parties are often better off abandoning the immigration issue and focusing on other policy areas during the campaign. As a result, anti-immigration narratives become more prominent during periods of election salience. In this article, we take advantage of the timing of the cross-national post-election surveys included in the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES) to explore the effects of election salience on individuals’ anti-immigration attitudes. We find that immigration attitudes become more polarized just after an election has taken place. On the one hand, right-wing respondents exhibit more negative attitudes toward immigrants when the election is salient, but those negative views decrease as we move away from the election. On the other hand, left-wing respondents express lower levels of xenophobia immediately after the election, but their immigration views become more negative as time since the election increases.

Drawing on original surveys of local and state legislators, I find that many legislators rhetorically support compromise but oppose compromise surreptitiously. Further, while women and Democrats are equally or more likely than men and Republicans to report supporting compromise when asked directly, this pattern reverses with women and some Democratic legislators opposing compromise more than men and Republicans when they can do so secretly.

Drawing on scholarship in party organization and descriptive representation, the study disaggregates both IPD into assembly-based (AIPD) and plebiscitary (PIPD) modes of participation, and leadership into two outcomes: women in top party roles and in national executive committees (NECs). Using multilevel regression and causal mediation analysis, the findings show that PIPD is associated with higher gender parity in NECs, but neither form of IPD directly predicts women’s access to top leadership. Instead, the gender composition of NECs mediates the effects of broader institutional variables—such as gender equality rules, women’s sub-organizations, and party ideology—on leadership outcomes.

The few studies that do engage these tools test for audience effects, but the content itself and the political strategies behind its curation and dissemination remain undertheorized. By adding an audiovisual lens to studies of authoritarian legitimation, we identify a regime durability strategy we term selective revivification. We specify the cognitive and affective characteristics of videos that quickly communicate information-dense, emotionally evocative messages, arguing that they engagingly distill specific historical elements to portray incumbent rule as not just legitimate but also necessary. In advancing our argument, we construct an original dataset of all existing narration-based YouTube videos shared by six regime institutions in Turkey from the establishment of YouTube in 2005 to 2022 ( n = 134). We use quantitative analysis to identify when video usage emerges as a strategy, as well as patterns of dissemination and content elements.

Focus groups reveal that these backlash effects are driven by voters’ dismay at electoral opportunism and the incumbent’s polarizing language following a large-scale disaster.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725102120", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725102120", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005801927392263928}, {"title": "The Unforgotten Women of the Islamic State.

Increasing evidence suggests that scholars are succeeding in getting their ideas and findings in the press, and their success bodes well for their ability to influence public and elite opinion. Despite these strides, we know little about when journalists may pick up on academic ideas and evidence or how they will report it in their stories. We seek to fill this gap. To explore the role of media as a conduit for academic knowledge, we surveyed more than 1,000 foreign policy journalists about their views on IR experts and expertise. We asked when, how, and how often respondents seek out IR scholars and scholarship in the course of their reporting. We also asked about the barriers to consuming peer-reviewed, scholarly research, if and how journalists interact with IR scholars on social media, and how IR scholars’ influence compares to that of scholars in other disciplines. Finally, we asked whether respondents cover a story differently if there is consensus among experts than if there is little agreement. In addition to providing empirical answers to these questions, we used our first-of-its-kind survey of foreign policy journalists to test several arguments from literature on the media and experts, including that journalists rely heavily on experts and expertise in developing and writing their stories, they rely more heavily on social science experts than other specialists, and they tend to inaccurately portray the level of consensus among the relevant experts. Our findings largely support these claims. First, foreign policy journalists often seek out IR experts and expertise for use in their stories, suggesting that the media acts as an important conveyor belt for academic knowledge. These journalists use academic expertise at several key stages, especially when researching background information. Second, foreign policy journalists, like journalists more generally, favor social science experts and expertise over experts from other disciplines. Finally, foreign policy journalists are no different than journalists overall in their tendency to create “false balance;” they underrepresent the degree of consensus among experts and oversample dissenters when scholars overwhelmingly favor a particular policy or interpretation of events.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725000763", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725000763", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.023997016592019027}, {"title": "Response to Dave Bridge’s Review of A Supreme Court Unlike Any Other: The Deepening Divide Between the Justices and the People", "authors": "Kevin J.

These measures are used to analyze the data in four ways. First, the measures are construed as moderators of the data and their statistical effects are estimated through a Bayesian framework. Second, the measures are used as factors to classify the data into topological classes using generative AI applied to GNNs constructed by transforming the data into graphs. The classification uncovers patterns in the data which are otherwise not accessible through statistical approaches. Third, the measures are used as factors that condition the extraction of latent variables of the data through a deployment of a generative AI model. Fourth, the measures are used as labels for classifying the graphs into classes used to offer a GNN-based effective dimensionality reduction of the original data.

While many scholars acknowledge the link between populist attitudes and political ideology, existing studies often treat this relationship as either a given or a peripheral concern. This paper represents an initial exploration into the association between populist attitudes and political ideology. Utilizing data from the fifth wave (2016–2021) of the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems, which encompasses 43 countries and 52 elections, this study aims to uncover how this relationship manifests cross-nationally. By employing a variety of rigorous methodological models, including the Generalized Additive Model, our results reveal a nonlinear relationship between populist attitudes and political ideology. Specifically, we find that political ideology and populist attitudes exhibit a U-shaped nonlinear relationship and that ideological extremism and populist attitudes demonstrate an exponential nonlinear relationship.

Our study reveals minimal overlap between organizations that engage in lobbying and those that make campaign contributions despite the perception that these activities are interchangeable forms of “money in politics.” Using comprehensive contribution and lobbying report data from 1998 to 2018, we find that most politically active organizations focus exclusively on either lobbying or making campaign contributions. Only a small percentage of organizations engage in both activities. This finding challenges the assumption that these forms of political activity are inherently linked. The majority of organizations engaged in political activity do so exclusively through lobbying. However, the top lobbying groups spend the most money and almost always have affiliated political action committees (PACs). Most lobbying money is spent by a small number of big spenders—organizations that also have affiliated PACs.

This study addresses a significant gap in the discipline’s understanding of the frequency and severity of STS experienced by political science interns in their fieldwork. We relied on surveys and written assessments from students enrolled in internship courses at two public universities. We find that interns report increased exposure to STS at the end of the semester.

The model explains that income levels of protesters influence the content of their demands, which in turn affect protest mobilization and effectiveness. Lower income classes join economic protests that dictators more often accommodate, but higher income classes join political protests that dictators tend to repress.

Official media, representing the party-state, frequently intervening in these online debates, act as both opinion leaders and mediators. This study examines how Weibo netizens perceive the party-state’s involvement in gender controversies and how these perceptions shape discussions around gender politics in China, shedding light on the evolving landscape of Chinese feminism. Drawing on the Scenario Approach to Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis, complemented by thematic analysis, this study analysed 3199 Weibo posts under two hashtags initiated by the party-state media. The findings reveal that netizens perceive the party-state as a betrayer of its original commitment to women, and an enforcer of double standards, favouring men while marginalising and instrumentalising women for political gain. The findings also reveal growing recognition of Chinese feminism among netizens, with particular attention to ‘pink feminists’ and their critical reflection on their dual identities. By examining the interplay between the party-state intervention and feminist discourse through the lens of netizen reactions, this study offers a unique perspective on the entanglement of party-state power, gender politics and digital activism in contemporary China.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251358524", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251358524", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008025094635277563}, {"title": "Imagined Democratic Affordances: Persistent Faith in the Democratic Power of the Internet among Sanders Supporters on Reddit", "authors": "Omri Cohen", "abstract": "Research on digital democracy and online mobilization often focus on how technological design, affordances, organizing, or policy may influence online political behaviors.

In this article, I explore this shift by drawing on ethnographic fieldwork with users of the TikTok app. More specifically, I write on their interactions with the TikTok algorithm as a form of human–machine interaction and through the lens of trust. Along concrete ethnographic data, this article lays out the multifaceted process in which participants negotiated trust in the TikTok algorithm as an interaction partner in their everyday pursuits for relaxation and entertainment. Understanding trust as something deeply relational, mediating the position that one takes to another, this article outlines the constitutive embodied and affective dimensions of trust. It shows how participants dealt with feelings of their trust in the TikTok algorithm being put to the test, as well as how they negotiated their distance and closeness to it accordingly. By doing so, this article will demonstrate how trust functions a key mediator of meaningful human–machine interaction – shaping not just meaningful outcomes but also meaningful processes of interaction. From this angle, this article closes with an argument for research on the foundational role of trust in human–machine interaction, specifically in ways that look beyond the cognitive processes of judging trust and broadening the scope towards the material and cultural contexts in which people trust others.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251370905", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251370905", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009187058240857082}, {"title": "Building resilience in telecommunications: Towards a research agenda - Editorial", "authors": "Erik Bohlin, Georg Serentschy", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103056", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103056", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019558918013257043}, {"title": "Total factor productivity and the evolving role of ICT in Indian manufacturing plants", "authors": "Komal Dutta, Bimal Kishore Sahoo, Sunandan Ghosh", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103051", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103051", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.028373630662800076}, {"title": "Source attribution and detection strategies for AI-era journalism", "authors": "Regina Luttrell, Jason Davis, Carrie Welch", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103053", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103053", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005455436532601166}, {"title": "When “more is less”: Connecting for a better life in rural Mexico", "authors": "Jorge Mora-Rivera, Fernando García-Mora, Manuel Cavazos-Castro", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103054", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103054", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.07473514250826396}, {"title": "Politics at the dinner table: Thanksgiving and social influences on political polarization", "authors": "Kirsten Cornelson", "abstract": "Can socializing with people who disagree with you change your opinions, and reduce political polarization?

People with very left-wing family move about 11% of a standard deviation to the left in the week of Thanksgiving, with a slightly larger response in the opposite direction for people with very right-wing family.

To bring the model to the data, we estimate both trade elasticities and a rich set of country- and industry-specific import demand elasticities for over 36,000 distinct sector-country pairs. We find that cross-country heterogeneities in export markups relative to import markups are a first-order determinant of the gains from trade and especially the welfare losses from tariffs. By flexibly taking heterogeneity in markups into account, these losses are up to three times larger for net exporters of high-markup products. We apply our model to the recent U.S.-China trade war and show that U.S. welfare losses from the tariff war are more than twice as high once markups and profit shifting are taken into account, whereas China benefited slightly overall.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaf029", "doi": "10.1093/jeea/jvaf029", "journal_full": "Journal of the European Economic Association", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.043668404442047004}, {"title": "Sparking Knowledge: Early Technology Adoption, Innovation Ability and Long-Run Growth", "authors": "Björn Brey", "abstract": "This paper examines the benefits of first-mover advantages in technology adoption.

Most fundamentally, the interpretations of what social remittances are have multiplied, posing the risk of reducing the term to little more than a catchphrase. To address this issue, this paper undertakes a systematic review of various conceptualisations of social remittances. We identify four primary areas of divergence within the existing literature on social remittances: the scope of the concept, i.e. the delineation of its boundaries, the underlying process of how social remittances are acquired and transferred, the spatial dimension of these transfers, particularly their direction, and the classification of subtypes of social remittances. Taking this as our starting point, we propose advancing Levitt’s original concept towards what we will term intangible remittances. Our advanced concept accounts for the multidimensionality of intangible remittances and provides essential clarifications in terms of delineation and terminology. Additionally, we put forward a fine-grained typology of different subtypes of intangible remittances, categorising them based on their content (that might be economic, environmental, political, or socio-cultural) and form (knowledge, normative structures, or practices). In summary, we provide a comprehensive framework of intangible remittances that not only integrates other emerging concepts, such as political remittances but also seamlessly aligns with the broader superordinate concept of remittances.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00484-6", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00484-6", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.7036304191117155}, {"title": "Introduction", "authors": "John Solomos", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2531296", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2531296", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004604675253937929}, {"title": "The war on critical race theory: or, the remaking of racism", "authors": "Kerry A.

Utilising comprehensive administrative data, including an exclusive panel dataset obtained from UK authorities, the author shows that (1) self‐funded students have become a significant source of immigration into the UK; (2) the majority of international students leave within 6 years, but a fifth stay in the UK for more than 10 years; (3) stay rates vary by country of origin and source of funding, with a higher proportion of self‐funded students from poorer countries staying in the UK for 10 years or more, as compared to scholarship students or students from richer countries who are more likely to leave. In other words, while student migration has outnumbered other work or family migration in the last decade, it remains mostly temporary. Only 2% of former international students transition to citizenship within 10 years.

The findings reveal a sharp rise in wage inequality among immigrants post-2013, surpassing overall wage inequality in the United States for the first time in 2023. High-skilled sectors, particularly IT, demonstrate a stabilizing effect on wage disparity, while low-skilled immigrants face growing wage gaps exacerbated by stringent visa policies and economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

To include this hard-to-reach population and conduct representative sampling, our research employs a method called respondent-driven sampling (RDS), which permits the surveying of a population devoid of a sampling frame.

Our objective is to find out whether areas with exceptional high numbers of centenarians can be found in the Netherlands. We use a long historical perspective analysing Dutch birth cohorts 1812–1923. We compiled a unique database of all centenarians (7074 men and 29,144 women), who died between 1912 and 2023 or were still alive in 2024. We examine long‐term national trends using the extreme longevity index (ELI). We use spatial clustering techniques to examine regional differences. We assess to what extent place of birth is indicative of the places where centenarians have spent their life. We investigate the relationship between ELI and municipal characteristics using spatial autoregressive models. From around birth cohort 1875 onwards ELI strongly increased up to 164 (male) and 813 (female) centenarians per 100,000 births for birth cohorts 1890–1923. High ELI clusters are found in the rural more isolated southwest and northeast, but also in the urbanised west of the country.

Established theories predominantly explain why they would not naturalise, yet in absolute terms, many do. To better understand those exceptional cases, this article focuses specially on determinants of naturalisation of migrants from high income countries, relying on a unique probability‐based survey of German emigrants augmented with country‐level information from GLOBALCIT and the V‐Dem project ( N = 1876). In line with the notion that their original citizenship provides substantial mobility rights, including the opportunity to return to a stable, wealthy country, dual citizenship toleration is a strong predictor of their naturalisation intentions. Because the instrumental value of an additional citizenship is so low for migrants from high income countries, subjective aspects like emotional attachment to the host country and emotional detachment from the origin country matter as well. Finally, interest in host country politics and elements of participatory democracy in host countries are also associated with naturalisation intentions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70105", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70105", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.992130908244264}, {"title": "Can Spatial Diffusion Process Explain Family Changes? A Spatio‐Temporal Analysis of Nonmarital Births Over 50 Years in Belgium (1968–2017)", "authors": "Yoann Doignon, Adrita Banerjee", "abstract": "Over the decades, many European countries have experienced significant changes in the family, characterised by declining marriage rates, increasing cohabitation, delayed childbearing and persistently low fertility. The Second Demographic Transition (SDT) has been a key framework for understanding these shifts, with alternative theories focusing on economic, cultural, and gender‐related factors. Despite extensive research, the geographical dimension of these changes remains underexplored, in particular a detailed spatio‐temporal analysis of the determinants of their spatial dynamics from their onset. This study fills this gap by examining the spatial dynamics of nonmarital births in Belgium over the last 50 years at the municipal level and by tracing the evolution of key explanatory variables. Using spatial modelling, we find a significant spatial diffusion effect, i.e. that nonmarital birth rates in a municipality are influenced by rates in neighbouring municipalities from previous periods. This finding highlights the importance of geographical proximity as a key determinant of family change, alongside socioeconomic factors. In addition, the study identifies the factors driving these spatial dynamics, quantifies their relative impact, and systematically ranks them across time. It suggests that different theoretical frameworks are relevant to explain the different stages of the diffusion process.

Our interventions focused on extremely vulnerable households, most with no prior-year earnings, who were at risk of missing out on two crucial benefits: the 2021 expanded Child Tax Credit and pandemic-relief Economic Impact Payments. Light-touch outreach consistently increased take-up of these benefits by 0.14 to 2 percentage points—a 150% to over 500% relative increase—regardless of message, sample, timing, or modality. These light-touch approaches resulted in over $4 million disbursed, with a highly cost-effective return of $50 to over $8,000 per $1 spent. However, higher-touch proactive outreach, varying messaging, and more precise targeting yielded minimal additional benefits, with proactive outreach even showing negative returns.

These patterns fit a “shrinking horizon” mechanism: As a mayor approaches a mandatory exit, the expected duration of illicit exchanges collapses, dampening the willingness of public servants to collaborate.

Our contribution addresses a core theoretical puzzle: With AI algorithms being increasingly embedded across public services, we lack crucial knowledge about how citizens assign responsibility to public organizations for algorithmic failures and discrimination in public services compared to human discrimination. This speaks to key questions as to whether organizational responsibility attribution mechanisms and public demand for consequences fundamentally change in the context of algorithmic governance. Addressing this gap, we examine whether individual citizens are less likely to attribute responsibility for algorithmic vs human discrimination in public service provision. Building on psychology literature, we further theorize potential mechanisms that underlie these effects and shape citizens’ responses. We investigate these research questions through a pre-registered survey experiment conducted in the Netherlands (N=2,483). Our findings indicate that public organizations are not held to a lower responsibility standard for algorithmic compared to human discrimination. Technological delegation to AI does not allow public bodies to bypass responsibility for discriminatory outcomes. However, we find that citizens assign more responsibility for algorithmic discrimination when the algorithm is developed inhouse rather than externally.

Increased accountability intensity, characterized by close supervision and strict sanctions, can reduce intrinsic motivation and decrease public employees' willingness to engage in their tasks proactively. Conversely, the imposition of an additional hierarchical accountability obligation—the perceived duty to justify actions to higher-level administrative supervisors or political leaders—can either enhance or hinder work drive, depending on whether public employees view it as an opportunity to gain benefits or as coercive pressure. To explore this, we conducted a survey experiment with 1221 public employees in China.

The red tape index measures the excess stringency of regulation in each industry relative to a benchmark level of regulation and then weights the extent of excess stringency on the industrial composition of each state. As a comprehensive measure of regulation, the red tape index differs fundamentally from other existing measures of state‐level regulation, which tend to target a particular type of regulation (e.g., labor market regulation). The red tape index reveals wide variation in the level of industry regulation among states and that most states have regulations that go beyond a so‐called “light touch” regulatory approach, implying that red tape is pervasive.

I investigate how immigrants may experience marginalization in contemporary US labor markets despite their employment participation. I propose that this marginalization may be reflected in occupational trait differentials across moral, mechanistic, and animalistic dimensions within citizenship hierarchies. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of three recent nationally representative US samples provide consistent evidence that citizenship ladders contribute to stratification in workers’ occupational traits across each marginalization dimension, leading to diverging trajectories. Beyond the prominent non-monetary trait gaps between citizens and non-citizens, the results reveal persistent disparities tied to birthright and naturalized citizenship statuses, particularly for Asian and Hispanic immigrants. These trait differentials help to segment occupational roles based on citizenship hierarchies, potentially limiting immigrants’ decision-making freedom and workplace influence, and reducing access to positions emphasizing moral judgment or expressive communication skills.

RHD research has also lagged behind the spectacular growth of online apps for conducting private rental transactions. We present a novel instant messaging correspondence test to study (real) private landlords’ responses to (fictitious) flat seekers of native and Chinese background in Madrid, Spain.

Freeman", "abstract": "Objective. Prior research on gun ownership and violent crime has yielded inconsistent conclusions, largely because nearly all studies rely on proxy measures of prevalence - surveys, state-level aggregates, or policy classifications - that cannot isolate handgun ownership, cannot confirm lawful versus illicit possession, and are vulnerable to confounding. For example, Kleck (1997) and Cook &amp; Ludwig (2006) highlighted measurement error as the main barrier to inference, Siegel et al. (2014) reported positive associations using household survey proxies, and Donohue et al. (2019) found liberalized right-to-carry regimes associated with higher violent crime, but with treatment defined as legal regime type rather than actual prevalence. As the National Research Council concluded in its landmark 2004 review, available studies were too compromised by proxy limitations and unmeasured confounders to provide reliable evidence of causal effects. Design. This study is the first to eliminate that uncertainty by restricting analysis to U.S. jurisdictions that publish auditable, administrative counts of active resident handgun licenses. We constructed two cohorts: A (higher licensing prevalence, mean ≈ 10.7% of residents) and B (lower prevalence, ≤1.6%). We then compared two-year (2023-2024) totals for homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault per 100,000 residents, with covariates for poverty (%), sworn law-enforcement staffing (LEO per 100,000) and population density. We estimated cohort means and rate ratios, Pearson correlations with Fisher-z intervals, OLS slopes of violent rate on licensing share, and Poisson GLMs with log(population) offsets to report percent change per +1-percentage point increase in licensed share. Results. Mean violent crime was ≈ 542 per 100,000 in Cohort A versus ≈ 1,238 per 100,000 in Cohort B (rate ratio ≈ 2.28, 95% CI 1.52-3.43). Each +1-percentage point increase in licensing share corresponded to ≈ 7.6% lower violent incidence (IRR 0.924; 95% CI 0.890-0.958), or ≈ 60-70 fewer incidents per 100,000 depending on model specification. Adjusting for poverty or LEO staffing attenuated but did not eliminate the association. Population density was negatively correlated. Sensitivity analyses excluding outliers (Flint, MI and Washington, DC) yielded consistent results. Conclusions. This study is the first to demonstrate, using clean administrative licensing exposure measures, that higher lawful handgun ownership prevalence is strongly and inversely associated with personal violent crime. The association is robust across models and covariates, survives outlier tests, and directly addresses the measurement weaknesses that have limited prior scholarship. Unlike advocacy-sponsored work, this study is independent, fully transparent, and reproducible, providing the strongest evidence to date that lawful handgun prevalence aligns with substantially lower violent crime rates. We emphasize correlation rather than causation, highlight demographic, lifestyle and illicit-market limitations, and provide a reproducibility appendix with administrative URLs to support independent audit.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/65x4s_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/65x4s_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014329023187882317}, {"title": "Who Breaks the Stigma?

I test this idea using the case of Vox in Spain, which entered parliament in April 2019 and gained further ground in a second national election six months later. During this period, initial support came disproportionately from higher-income voters. Lower-income individuals were more likely to withhold support in socially exposed interviews, and early voting patterns are consistent with the idea that expressive inhibition may have constrained their support.

I find that local newspapers, especially those with smaller circulations, consistently employ a more positive tone compared to national newspapers overall and on specific issues. Contrary to expectations, local newspapers became more positive over time, widening the sentiment gap with national outlets. The study suggests that the decline of local news and increased reliance on national sources may expose readers to more negative content overall. These findings have implications for understanding how changes in the media landscape could impact public perceptions and civic engagement. They also suggest greater attention should be paid to low-circulation local newspaper, who are often excluded from content analyses of local news.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqgn2_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uqgn2_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009428985752005237}, {"title": "Political Action in the Dark Web: Political Mobilization and Radicalization in Illicit Digital Networks", "authors": "Conner Joyce", "abstract": "What explains political mobilization and radicalization within illicit digital networks?

Community-level justification independently increased risk, while higher country-level gender equality was linked to lower IPV exposures. The association between neighbourhood norms and women’s risk was moderated by spousal attitudes, with the association strongest among couples in which neither partner justified IPV.

While much research has focused on the economic sustainability of delayed retirement, fewer studies have examined whether retiring at or after the statutory age impacts subjective well-being in comparison to early retirement. This study addresses that gap by investigating whether retirement timing, specifically early versus at statutory-age, shapes quality of life in later years. Using cross-sectional data from Wave 7 of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), retired individuals aged 50 and over were focused upon. The CASP-19 scale (Control, Autonomy, Self-Realisation, Pleasure), a validated measure of older adults’ quality of life based on control, autonomy, self-realisation, and pleasure, was used as the central outcome variable. Using non-parametric statistical comparisons and unsupervised clustering techniques, differences in CASP scores and associated social, financial, and health variables between early and timely retirees were examined. Analysis reveals that early retirees, despite potentially shorter working lives, tend to report better quality of life, particularly in the autonomy and pleasure subscales of CASP. Additionally, we identify distinct post-retirement profiles through cluster analysis, highlighting the importance of relational closeness and financial preparedness in shaping subjective well-being. This study contributes to ongoing debates in social gerontology by offering a nuanced understanding of how retirement timing intersects with psychosocial outcomes in later life.

While extensive scholarship critiques citizenship stripping as discriminatory and rights diminishing, it offers no resolution to this dilemma. This paper addresses this critical gap by advancing a novel, albeit contentious, argument: that in specific, narrowly defined circumstances, citizenship revocation can be reconceptualised not as a punitive tool but as a protective, life-preserving measure. The central thesis is that for individuals with access to an alternative nationality who are on a foreseeable path to a lethal confrontation with the state, pre-emptive revocation of their UK citizenship could serve to uphold their most fundamental human right, the right to life, by removing them from the jurisdiction where that life is in imminent peril. Grounding this claim in a critical re-evaluation of Arendt’s right to have rights and a radical inversion of the principle of non-refoulement, this paper argues for a situational hierarchy where the biological right to life must precede the institutional right to nationality. This theoretical intervention reframes revocation as the fulfilment of prospective duty of care.

We show that RC28 scholars have increasingly emphasized educational, income and wealth, and gender inequality, while placing less focus on social class. Some of the most highly cited research over the last two decades include studies on the consequences of income inequality, differential economic returns to college, family background effects on children’s achievement, gender gaps in educational achievement, persistent inequality in educational attainment, changes in intergenerational mobility patterns, and the importance of wealth inequality.

We compare four groups of students: students never classified as EL, ELs who were reclassified in elementary school, ELs who were reclassified in middle school, and ELs who were reclassified in high school or never reclassified. We find that EL–never-EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes vary by the timing of reclassification, but are largely explained by sociodemographic, academic, and school-level factors. We also show that ELs reclassified in later grade levels take fewer college-level courses in high school than never-EL students and ELs reclassified in earlier grade levels. Finally, through nonlinear variance decomposition, we determine that a substantial portion of EL gaps in postsecondary outcomes is explained by EL gaps in college-level course-taking during high school.

By integrating classical sociological theory, Durkheim, Weber, Marx, Simmel, and Elias, with recent perspectives from media and digital activism studies (Castells, Tufekci, Bennett &amp; Segerberg, Zuboff), this paper develops a framework centered on three categories: networked solidarity, diffused leadership, and algorithmic consciousness.

We then use linear regression models to assess how remaining childless, education and place of residence are associated with the degree of alignment with each trajectory type, as measured by representativeness scores (Helske et al., 2024). RESULTS Five trajectory types were identified in each country, including patterns of early and stable partnerships and others marked by delayed transitions. Remaining childless was mostly associated with later residential independence and the near absence of partnership formation. In Finland, a distinct cluster highlights how being single after a separation is also associated with childlessness. In contrast, stable marriage pathways were strongly associated with parenthood. CONTRIBUTION The study demonstrates how the interplay of partnership, residential independence and income trajectories, shaped by education and institutional context, produces distinct pathways associated with childlessness in early mid-life.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jh7ym_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jh7ym_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008987918000099682}, {"title": "Ukrainian Refugees in Switzerland 3 Years On: A First Look", "authors": "Valeriia Hett, Didier Ruedin", "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present initial findings from an ongoing empirical study of Ukrainian refugees in Switzerland, living under temporary protection Status S, notably their socio-economic integration, interaction with public services, and future aspirations. Data are drawn from an ad-hoc online survey started in March 2025, which includes N=1470 participants to date and demonstrates reasonable levels of representativeness across demographic and labour indicators. Findings indicate that despite the persistent uncertainty and structural limitations imposed by the temporary legal framework, many Ukrainian refugees are actively seeking employment, learning local languages and participating in education. These trajectories reflect not only functional participation in host society government structures, but also strategic forms of adaptation under conditions of legal ambiguity. The absence of a clear path to permanent residence does not stop integration efforts, but it influences their form, embedding them within a framework of temporariness and limited planning horizons. At the same time a lack of accessible and consistent information, particularly regarding administrative procedures and about support services, continues to be a significant barrier. In practice, however, Ukrainian refugees tend to compensate for institutional complexity through informal networks and self-navigation strategies. While more respondents express a desire to remain in Switzerland, their capacity to plan for the future is fundamentally shaped by the temporary and conditional nature of their legal status. Although Swiss institutional resources are generally perceived as more trustworthy than Ukrainian ones when it comes to accessing support, many refugees face barriers in reaching these sources, including linguistic and administrative complexity. The inability to access stable, long-term institutional frameworks reinforces a mode of existence defined by limited predictability and fragmented engagement with the state. These preliminary findings contribute to understanding how temporary protection operates not only as a legal category, but also a socio-political condition that determines access, restricts belonging and structures the temporal and institutional aspects of movement.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kswn6_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/kswn6_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.9783404381559105}, {"title": "Maternal Occupation-Specific Skills and Cognitive and Non-Cognitive Child Development in Germany", "authors": "Gundula Zoch, Susanne Schmid, Ann-Christin Bächmann", "abstract": "This study examines the link between maternal occupation-specific skills and child development following mothers’ return to work.

One of the key actors in the research ecosystems are research funding organizations, yet their activities are comparatively little studied in relation to excellence. This paper aims to contribute to the excellence debate through an empirical study of how notions of excellence are used, and what functions they serve, in eight research funding organizations. Our study shows research funding organizations have recognized critical voices and are taking steps to address some of the problematic aspects of excellence. However, because research funding organizations are shaped by the excellence regime, and constrained by both governmental policy and scientific elites, research funding organizations cannot simply resort to a debunking critique and do away with excellence altogether. In their efforts to navigate their ambiguous relationship to excellence we show that in many of our case study sites the approach to excellence has shifted from it being taken as a ‘matter of fact’, that is rather taken for granted, to a ‘matter of concern’, that needs to be unpacked and reconfigured. We find funders resort to three mitigation strategies, patching, pluralizing and transforming, in their attempts to reconfigure excellence. Our findings suggest, however, that the current mitigation strategies adopted by funders aimed at reconfiguring excellence leave underlying assumptions about competition and meritocratic ideals largely unquestioned.

Since then, the local UCCN secretariat and the municipality of Sanandaj, have tried both to promote music as a brand for the city and to involve the public and private sectors in integrating culture in urban development plans. In this context, some Lotis—professional musicians who are usually recruited to play in wedding ceremonies—have made the streets their new performance venue. After the pandemic deprived them of their usual livelihoods performing at weddings, they began performing on pedestrian thoroughfares and in other public, high-traffic locations. These performance settings would seem to align perfectly with the UCCN’s agenda, yet Lotis have also faced continued marginalization by city authorities. Drawing on ethnographic research among Lotis, their audiences, and local authorities, and on documentation from the Sanandaj UCCN secretariat, I argue that although the UCCN’s partnership with Sanandaj has provided Lotis with new professional opportunities, police control on the streets has limited these musicians’ creative abilities they are renowned for, i.e., engaging mere observers in the process of merrymaking.

Grounded in a relational ontology, this perspective refuses ontological separations between ‘human’, ‘environment’, and ‘technology’; instead, it frames them as intra-acting, constitutive elements in dynamic assemblages. Drawing on Karen Barad’s notion of intra-action (Barad, 2007), Donna Haraway’s concept of sympoiesis (Haraway, 2016), and Rosi Braidotti’s affirmative ethics of relationality (Braidotti, 2013), Eco-Digital Posthumanism offers a robust ontological and ethical basis for reconsidering human-technology-environment relations as fundamentally entangled. The related EcoAI framework proposes that emergent eco-technologies — including sensing infrastructures, AI-driven environmental monitoring, and digitally mediated communal platforms — are not mere tools, but active mediators that shape both material reality and collective subjectivity. In this light, humans are reconceived as eco-technological intra-agents: their agency is neither purely individual nor detached but arises in dyadic and poly-nodal entanglements with environments and technologies. The ethical imperative intrinsic to this view is to design infrastructures and learning ecologies that foster mutual care, multispecies attentiveness, and distributed co-agency. A vital tension animates the formation of the Eco-Digital Humanism theory: on one side, the ecological system demands renewed forms of relationality between humans, environments, places, and presences. This demand emphasizes physical co-presence, material engagement, and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledge, embodied awareness, and ecological responsiveness. Here, educational media play a key role: Antonio López defines ecomedia literacy as the critical capacity to comprehend and engage with the reciprocal ecological “footprint” and cultural “mindprint” of media systems (López 2020, DOI:10.4324/9780203731109). This socio-pedagogical pillar grounds the theory in media-ecological practice. It calls for pedagogies and practices that re-embed subjectivities in place-based knowledges, somatic awareness, and ecological attunement. On the other hand, stands the rise of an immaterial relational geographies: social media, algorithmic platforms, influential digital narratives, ephemeral trend dynamics, and hyper-mediated connectivity craft relational spaces that lean toward an individualistic massification which often replace embodied interaction with curated digital self-expression and mediated connectivity with risks of disembedding relationality. These forces often substitute co-present engagement — with its embodied gestures, proxemics, and spontaneous nonverbal communication — with curated digital self-expression and algorithm-driven interaction. The communication shifts from embodied co-construction to performative self-branding, from tangible immediacy to mediated simulacra. José van Dijck and colleagues analyse how these platforms shape public life and values through infrastructural power (van Dijck, Poell &amp; de Waal 2018, DOI:10.23860/MGDR-2018-03-03-08). Moreover, scholars like Couldry and Mejias warn of data colonialism, where personal data are appropriated in ways akin to digital exploitation (Couldry &amp; Mejias 2019, DOI:10.1177/1527476418796632). These critical sociological perspectives highlight how algorithmic systems can erode embodied co-presence and place-based relationality. This tension must be at the heart of Eco-Digital Humanism: it calls for technologies, pedagogies, and AI systems that restore and augment embodied, place-rooted relational ethics, rather than further eroding them. Eco-Digital Posthumanism therefore envisions a middle path: techno-ecological designs and curricular frameworks that honour the ecological imperative for reciprocity, material co-presence, and affective attunement, while resisting the flattening of relationality that results from algorithmic mass individualism. In this, Eco-Digital Posthumanism embeds both philosophical depth and sociological grounding (López, van Dijck, Couldry &amp; Mejias), extending ecological posthumanism (as developed by Oppermann, 2016;) and material ecocriticism (Iovino &amp; Oppermann, 2014), by providing a mediation-centred, operational lens for guiding education, ethical design, and the governance of AI-mediated environments. In sum, Eco-Digital Humanism posits that humans, non-humans, and technological systems co-create worlds; that ecological instances of sustainability necessitate relational, place-embedded forms of being and that the rising immaterial relational geographies without proper literacy threaten to separate us from those embodied ecologies. The theory thus demands a reconfiguration — through EcoAI Framework — of pedagogy, policy, and design, so that the digital infrastructures serve ecological relationality rather than displace it.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wxnu8_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wxnu8_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02478612150155446}, {"title": "Police use of CS smoke at outbreaks of serious public disorder in Great Britain", "authors": "Steve Hill", "abstract": "This paper presents a contentious possibility to minimise close proximity injuries sustained between the public and police resources including horses and dogs during outbreaks of serious public disorder in Great Britain.

The primary scientific inquiry is how structural environmental variables, such as land use, energy mix, sanitation, and climatic stress, co-interact to affect respiratory mortality across regions. Although prior literature has addressed individual environmental predictors in singleton settings, this paper fills an integral gap by using a multi-method, systems-level analysis that accounts for interdependencies as well as contextual variability. The statistical analysis draws on panel data covering several years and nation-states using fixed effects regressions with robust standard errors for evaluating the effects of variables such as agricultural land use (AGRL), access to electricity (ELEC), renewable energy (RENE), freshwater withdrawals (WTRW), cooling degree days (CDD), and sanitation (SANS). We employ cluster analysis and density-based methodology to identify spatial and environmental groupings, while machine learning regressions—specifically, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—are utilized for predictive modeling and evaluating feature importance. Lastly, network analysis identifies the structural connections between variables, including influence metrics and directional weights. We obtain the following results: Consistently, across all regressions, AGRL, WTRW, and SANS feature importantly when determining the effect for TRD. Consistently across all networks, influencer metrics identify AGRL, WTRW, and SANS as key influencers.

Our second distinction pertains to the cross-pressures of fitting in versus standing out within organizations.

Drawing on insights from sustainability transitions and intermediary actors, we find that individuals working within organisations and small businesses adopt a role as intermediary actors at the smaller scale. We call these actors ‘everyday intermediaries’ and demonstrate how they take on a role to mediate the CE to wider society, working to connect actors, resources and skills across the CE, and to translate the behaviours and practices necessary for a successful transition to CE to the everyday context. We add to the growing body of literature about the contributions of social science in understanding the transition to the CE and empirically demonstrate the active and engaged role of smaller-scale actors in bringing change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/czxeh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/czxeh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006525723435904185}, {"title": "Growing the climate movement by centering transformative adaptation", "authors": "Kevin A.

This presents a theoretical impasse when analyzing labor movements in contexts such as Iran. To address this, I develop a Gramscian framework introducing the concept of embryonic counter-hegemony: organizational efforts that enact counter-hegemonic logics and practices but remain fragile, structurally constrained, and temporally limited. This article examines two landmark cases of autonomous labor organizing in Iran: the Haft Tappeh Sugarcane Company (HTSC) and the Iran National Steel Industrial Group (INSIG). In both cases, workers bypassed state-controlled institutions and formed alternative organizational structures—general assemblies—to contest privatization, demand democratic control over production, and resist state repression. While these formations did not consolidate into stable counter-hegemonic blocs, they embodied embryonic practices of democratic governance and oppositional consciousness. Drawing on four years of content analysis of Telegram posts, public interviews with worker organizers, and archival protest coverage, I show how these labor assemblies developed participatory procedures, resisted co-optation, and articulated alternative political imaginaries. By theorizing these formations as embryonic rather than failed or merely reactive, I reorient counter-hegemonic analysis toward the organizational practices and strategic contradictions of resistance under authoritarianism.

The most recent chapter in this ongoing story is the coevolution between humans and artificial intelligence (AI) – a social phenomenon whereby humans and AI-driven online platforms evolve in tandem, each influencing the evolution of the other, producing complex and unintended collective outcomes. At the heart of this process lies the human-AI feedback loop, its core mechanism, that significantly exacerbates economic inequalities through preferential attachment and marginalization processes. The article draws a political economy of this emerging phenomenon considering the study of Very Large Online Platforms as a vantage point. It contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it considers jointly classical processes of capital accumulation and those emerging as a result of human-AI coevolution, elaborating the concepts of ‘privatization of the general intellect’ and ‘accumulation of the means of recommendation’. Second, it discusses the phenomenon of economic inequality amplification due to the human-AI feedback loop on the basis of empirical evidence from computer science.

Methods: Two studies investigated how individual predispositions and information processing styles shape attitudes toward moringa among consumers unfamiliar with it. Study 1 (N = 322) used a correlational design to examine the role of superfoods attitudes, personality traits, thinking styles, and social norms. Study 2 (N = 268) employed an experimental design to test how message processing (central vs. peripheral) moderates these relationships. Results: Across both studies, a general positive attitude toward superfoods predicted higher perceived message credibility and more favorable attitudes toward moringa. These effects were especially pronounced under peripheral processing (Study 2). Intuitive thinking and perceived social norms also contributed to positive responses, while analytical thinking and food-health beliefs had weaker or unexpected effects (Study 1).

Every single month of drought during the June–October growing season reduces the share of people working in agriculture the following year by 1.2 percentage points. Nationally, this translates to ~3.3 million fewer people working in farming for each extra month of drought (95 % CI: 2.1– 4.5 million).

The methodology employed is a synthesis of empirical studies, theoretical frameworks, and lived experience. The analysis highlights the collapse of perceptual trust, the reorganization of autobiographical memory, and introduces the novel concept of the \"grey phase\"-a distinct period marked by emotional numbness, psychic detachment, and dissociation. While this phase has been described implicitly in trauma literature, this paper explicitly names and frames it as a neurobiological and psychological intermission essential to recovery. This layered, compassionate, and academically grounded model enhances understanding of how trauma ruptures narrative identity and how healing entails its gradual reconstruction. The paper concludes that recovery reflects complex psychological integration rather than pathology. Note on Perspective While acknowledging the importance of lived experience in understanding betrayal trauma, this paper is primarily an academic synthesis of peer-reviewed psychological research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g7e42_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/g7e42_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010501511874452363}, {"title": "Analysis and Possible Translation of the Voynich Manuscript: A Phonetic and Linguistic Study of Folio 78r, Folio 70v (\"The Goat\"), and Selected Herbal Folios", "authors": "Katerina Havrankova", "abstract": "This study presents a structured attempt at deciphering the Voynich Manuscript, focusing on folio 78r (from the so-called balneological section depicting bathing women), folio 70v (the Zodiac Capricorn or “Goat” folio from the astrological section), and three herbal folios. The central hypothesis is that the text represents an existing language—most plausibly an archaic form of Basque—recorded phonetically and written with unfamiliar symbols in place of ordinary letters. The analysis combines identification of vowels and recurring letter patterns with systematic comparison to Basque vocabulary and morphology, yielding partial but consistent matches. Evidence also points to contact with Old French, Castilian, Gascon, and Latin, reflecting the multilingual environment of late medieval Navarre. The herbal folios align with descriptive plant entries typical of medieval herbals, mentioning stems, joints, sap, bitterness, and preparations such as decoctions. Folio 78r, usually interpreted as part of the balneological section, is here read as a description of water channels, basins, and flowing currents, consistent with the illustrations of bathing women. Folio 70v, traditionally identified with Capricorn in the zodiac cycle, is interpreted as a text describing cyclical or seasonal processes, in line with its astrological imagery. Although the translations remain provisional, the findings suggest that the manuscript is unlikely to represent an invented language. Instead, it may be a distorted record of existing speech and knowledge, intentionally obscured through phonetic variation and a disguised script.

Homo floresiensis’ reduced cranial capacity combined with dissimilar gracile and robust postcranial features became a point of contention in finding a clear identity in the Homo pathology. Two primary hypotheses have been proposed to explain this divergence: the Phyletic Dwarfism Hypothesis, which posits descent from Homo erectus via insular dwarfism driven by deterministic selection, and the Genetic Drift Hypothesis, which attributes its unique morphology to neutral evolutionary processes in a small, isolated population. This study quantitatively tests these competing hypotheses using a multivariate morphometric approach applied to 3D landmark data from the H. floresiensis holotype (LB1) and comparative samples of H. erectus, H. habilis, Australopithecus, H. sapiens, and great apes.

Methodologically, this study combines strategic intelligence analysis with policy evaluation, employing comparative case studies, interdisciplinary literature reviews, and institutional design frameworks. It draws upon the DARPA ‘Heilmeier Eight Questions’ and the EU's mission-oriented innovation model for its arguments. Findings indicate that by establishing a national-level social science research platform, optimising research funding mechanisms, fostering closer alignment between academic pursuits and strategic imperatives, and developing deepfake forensics alongside cognitive immunity systems, social sciences may evolve from traditional knowledge accumulation into resources serving strategic decision-making and cognitive competition. This transformative trajectory enhances political narrative power and cognitive dominance, bolsters institutional adaptability, and furnishes nations with combined soft and hard competitive advantages on the international stage.

The research analyses the intersection of carbon neutrality-driven land-use changes with existing patterns of land grabbing and concentration, revealing significant limitations in current just-transition approaches. Through a critical analysis of European climate policy frameworks and land governance mechanisms, the study demonstrates that the land dimension represents a notable blind spot in just-transition approaches. The findings indicate that existing frameworks, primarily focused on industrial restructuring and labor market adaptation, cannot adequately address the challenges of ensuring democratic access to and control over land resources. The paper proposes the concept of a \"land-just transition\" as a necessary evolution, advocating for the explicit integration of land justice considerations into climate transition frameworks. This approach would expand beyond compensation and adaptation to address fundamental questions of land governance and democratic control.

Drawing from the dynamics of affects, as drivers for action, in Jeanne Favret-Saada’s ethnography of rural sorcery, the article develops the model further to resolve this shift.

This discussion paper explores how computational access can expand the study and reuse of such collections by presenting a dataset of 435 Ottoman miniatures, enriched with detailed bibliographic metadata and expert-assigned thematic tags. An original multi-level classification scheme was developed. Tagging was carried out through a custom web interface, preparing the dataset for analysis through thematic network analysis, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning. Thematic co-occurrence analysis revealed clusters such as political figures, religious motifs, and urban settings, demonstrating the interpretive value of tagging beyond traditional cataloguing. Supervised learning with MobileNetV2 achieved 63% training accuracy and 49% validation accuracy, showing the model’s capacity to identify dominant themes while also exposing the limits of small and imbalanced datasets. Unsupervised clustering produced visually coherent groups, but low Silhouette scores and high Davies-Bouldin indices confirmed that thematic boundaries were not strongly separable through visual features alone. The findings highlight the need to combine computational methods with expert knowledge.
