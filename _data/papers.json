[{"title": "Descriptive or Partisan Representation? Examining Trade-Offs for Asian Americans", "authors": "John J. Cho, Mia Costa, Yusaku Horiuchi", "abstract": "Do voters want representatives who share their race, ethnicity, or partisanship? We examine this question with a focus on Asian Americans who face trade-offs between descriptive (that is, Asian American or ‘pan-ethnic’) and partisan representation, as well as trade-offs involving ‘co-ethnic’ (for example, Korean for Korean) and ‘cross-ethnic’ (for example, Indian for Korean) descriptive representation. Across two experiments, we find that when Asian Americans are asked about collective representation in Congress, they prioritize more co-ethnic and pan-ethnic legislators over co-partisan legislators. However, in a competitive electoral setting, they often trade off race/ethnicity for partisanship. Asian Americans are only willing to cross party lines to vote for a co-ethnic candidate, but never for a cross- or pan-ethnic candidate. These findings shed light on the importance of considering heterogeneous preferences along ethnicities within the same racial ‘in-group’, such as Asian Americans, a heavily understudied and heterogeneous group in American politics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425101324", "doi": "10.1017/s0007123425101324", "journal_full": "British Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.19375626614072283}, {"title": "How Bad Can It Get?

Our findings show pronounced partisan bias undermining support for electoral integrity – approximately 40 per cent of party supporters with an average level of partisanship supported rerunning an election when their party unexpectedly lost – but less bias in judgments about national security, raising the possibility that individuals may view democracy as more of an instrumental than an intrinsic good.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425101257", "doi": "10.1017/s0007123425101257", "journal_full": "British Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007627905289157244}, {"title": "The Unequal Challenge of Learning from Under-Informative News", "authors": "Andrew Trexler", "abstract": "Political news consumption is highly uneven today: few people consume from news outlets directly, while many encounter news incidentally through social media and aggregators.

Several contemporary styles of news coverage—which emphasize partisan conflict, employ specialized jargon, engage in predictive analysis, and use clickbait language—are attractive to core consumers, but may also make news less accessible for others. In a pre-registered survey experiment ( n = 2,233), I show that, relative to a public interest style that prioritizes key information about policy and democratic norms, typical news styles weaken post-exposure recall of key news information—that is, they are under-informative.

Engaging three main bodies of literature, transnationalism, social network theory and migration in contexts of war and displacement, this study explores how migrants manage ties across a geo‐social triangle: the origin country, the host country and third countries. The analysis identifies two relational phases: an initial overload and triage of social ties, followed by a phase of relational calibration, in which migrants make strategic and emotionally and morally charged decisions about with whom to connect, support or withdraw from.

Perceptions of the demobilizing effects of repression", "authors": "Anne-Kathrin Kreft, Ragnhild Nordås, Ingrid Vik Bakken", "abstract": "Although many scholars have studied the effects of repression on dissent, we have relatively little information on how the public perceives these effects. Do people think that protesters are likely to demobilize when faced with repression? And do such perceptions depend on the particular repressive methods being used, the characteristics of the dissenters, or a combination of the two? This manuscript uses an experimental design to address these questions, inquiring specifically into gender dynamics in repressive victimization. Research outside repression scholarship shows that public perceptions of political actors are often based on gender stereotypes. However, gender has so far received less attention in studies of contentious politics, despite the growing involvement of women in protest movements worldwide and recent reports of gender-based and sexualized repression in different contexts. This study uses a survey experiment of a U.S. sample (N = 1,500), leveraging a vignette of a protest-repression scenario in a foreign country, which randomly varies the gender of the repressed protesters (men vs. women) and the repressive tactic (rape vs multiple electric shocks). The results reveal that rape is perceived as more demobilizing across the board. However, defying prominent gender stereotypes, respondents do not expect that women are more likely to demobilize than men, even following rape. Instead, women are assumed to mobilize friends and talk to journalists. The results highlight the need for a broader research program examining public perceptions of repression and gender in contentious politics.

Existing research considers the effects of terrorism on majority group attitudes; however, there is a significant gap regarding its effects on minorities. We address this gap by examining the impact of 2016–2017 terror attacks in Western Europe on the perceived discrimination of Muslims in Germany using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. We employ an unexpected event during survey design to estimate the causal effects of these attacks on Muslims' perceptions of ethnic discrimination and worry about xenophobia. Our results show that the effects of these attacks on Muslims are not uniform and depend on respondents' levels of education and integration. Respondents with higher levels of education and host language fluency are less likely to report perceived discrimination or worry about xenophobia following attacks, compared with those with lower levels of integration. These results are consistent with a dissociation–detachment mechanism, whereby more integrated members of a stigmatized group psychologically distance themselves from the in-group to buffer against the negative psychological impacts of discrimination in the aftermath of attacks.

The deterrence works because the target’s allies are both willing and able to impose severe economic punishment on the challenger. We refine this argument by introducing conditional extended dependence. We argue that for extended dependence to deter a potential challenger ex ante, the target’s allies must overcome two challenges. First, the potential challenger must believe those allies would credibly follow through with the threat of sufficiently harmful economic punishment. Second, the target’s allies successfully coordinate collective action to prevent the challenger from finding substitute markets. Extended dependence is more likely to fulfill these conditions when a “significant” state is centrally positioned within the target’s alliance network and exerts substantial leverage over other allies. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that extended dependence deters Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) initiations conditionally between 1951 and 2012, but unconditionally from 1870 to 1950.

Linking the nutrient composition of &gt;2,800 aquatic species with &gt;2 million fishmeal and farmed fish transactions in international aquatic food trade between 2015 and 2019, we examined aquaculture’s nutritional flows and distributional equity. We found that aquaculture provided adequate intakes for nearly a quarter of a million individuals, on average, across 14 key nutrients, and for up to 2.7 billion individuals for several nutrients, such as Vitamin B 12 . The vast majority of these nutrients (76.8%) were domestically retained, contributing to the nutritional security of producer countries. With most internationally traded nutrients originating from nutritionally vulnerable countries (57.7% for fishmeal and 66.3% for farmed aquatic foods), rethinking existing distribution policies with nutrition as the primary objective may help unlock the full potential of aquaculture to eliminate hunger and malnutrition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2506699123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2506699123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03913112377490435}, {"title": "Commodity frontiers expand more slowly into tropical forests where forest smallholders are present", "authors": "Marie Pratzer, Patrick Meyfroidt, Maria Vallejos, Tobias Kuemmerle", "abstract": "The expansion of commodity agriculture into tropical forests leads to major social–ecological impacts. Yet little is known about where and how the capitalized actors driving this expansion interact with smallholders, particularly where smallholders live inside the forest. Two alternative outcomes of their interactions on deforestation are plausible: accelerated deforestation as all actors compete for land (i.e., land rush hypothesis) or, alternatively, slower deforestation as actors hinder each other’s expansion (i.e., competition hypothesis). We test these hypotheses for two global deforestation hotspots: the Dry Chaco and the Chiquitano Forests (together nearly 1 million km 2 ), using a land-systems representation that captures spatially overlapping land-use actors. We integrate satellite-based forest-loss time series with an independent reconstruction of land-system change from 2000 to 2023 in a Bayesian regression framework. This reveals three key findings: First, capitalized agriculture has expanded mainly over areas used by forest-dependent smallholders and Indigenous communities, indicating strongly intensifying land competition. Second, where forest-dwelling smallholders persist, their presence can mitigate deforestation pressure from expanding commodity frontiers. Third, the presence of either forest-dwelling smallholders or conservation areas maintains forest cover, but their combined presence does not amplify the protection effect. Overall, our findings show that interactions between agribusinesses and smallholders are key factors that shape the social–ecological outcomes of frontier expansion in the tropics. Accounting for land-system overlaps in research and policymaking on frontiers can therefore improve efforts to safeguard forests while supporting traditional livelihoods, especially in contested, rapidly changing landscapes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2528453123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2528453123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.017028509665147573}, {"title": "Leveraging probabilistic forecasts for dengue preparedness and control: The 2024 Dengue Forecasting Sprint in Brazil", "authors": "Eduardo Correa Araujo, Luiz Max Carvalho, Fabiana Ganem, Luã Bida Vacaro, Leonardo S.

In Brazil, improving dengue forecasting became a priority in response to the unprecedented increase in cases, which surpassed the total of the previous decade and expanded to new regions. The Infodengue-Mosqlimate consortium launched the Infodengue-Mosqlimate Dengue Challenge 2024 (IMDC24), or Dengue Forecast Sprint, bringing together six international teams provided with cases and climate covariates data to generate actionable forecasts for 2024 and 2025 seasons in five diverse Brazilian states, leveraging advanced machine learning and classical statistical models. This paper outlines the structure and findings of the IMDC24. The performance of the models varied between years and locations, and no single model consistently excelled, especially during 2024’s unprecedentedly large season. This performance variability highlighted the need for ensemble approaches. The ensemble models developed are presented as the main results of this collaborative development.

Nonetheless, whether and how unreinforced and unconditioned social cues (i.e., suggestions about future experiences that have not been reinforced with reward or punishment) can create and sustain such effects is unknown. We conducted a set of experiments in which participants (N = 111) experienced stimuli eliciting somatic pain (heat), vicarious pain (videos of others in pain), and cognitive effort (a mental-rotation task), at three intensity levels each. Before each stimulus, participants viewed a social cue that ostensibly indicated ratings from 10 other participants but was in fact randomized to a high or low mean aversiveness level independent of actual stimulus intensity. Across all tasks, participants’ expectations and experience ratings shifted in line with the cues, with high-aversive cues leading to higher perceived aversiveness. Computational modeling and behavioral analysis revealed lower learning rates for prediction errors inconsistent with the trial’s cue value (e.g., better than expected for high-aversive cues) and higher learning rates for prediction errors consistent with the cue value (e.g., worse than expected for high-aversive cues). These findings reveal a confirmation bias in learning: people update more when outcomes align with expectations. Combined with expectation effects on perception, this bias helps sustain social cue effects.

Drawing from 13,823 publications across Scopus, Web of Science, and a curated library of ESI valuation studies, we identify 171 studies that applied ESI in a decision context and used a valuation method to compare outcomes with and without ESI. The majority of these studies employed decision analysis methods (e.g., Value of Information, Cost–Benefit Analysis), focusing primarily on quantitative instrumental values (e.g., profit, crop yield, lives saved), particularly in agricultural contexts. A smaller set of studies applied preference elicitation methods (e.g., stated preference, surveys, interviews, focus groups) to capture qualitative benefits and relational values including quality of life improvements, empowerment, and procedural justice. Many excluded studies demonstrated scientific value of ESI but did not explicitly translate that into societal value, revealing the need for a more systematic approach to ESI valuation.

As conservation and environmental practitioners and scholars grapple with foundational assumptions and practices of the field, there remains a pressing need to identify persistent problematic legacies and articulate a positive vision for conservation grounded in an ethic of justice. To help advance this conversation, we present a framework of four intersecting dimensions of oppression: 1) the physical or material manifestations of conservation and environmental management; 2) the knowledge practices and assumptions that inform and underpin conservation and environmental visions and decision-making; 3) the modes of governance associated with conservation and environmental practice; and 4) the forms of relational praxis implicitly and explicitly endorsed and/or imposed in conservation and other environmental arenas. We explain the framework through an analysis of the legacy of fortress conservation, then illustrate the framework’s wider application to diagnose ongoing elements of oppression in other environmental arenas (wildland fire, riverine flows). We then review prominent strategies and visions for moving forward for both nature and people to highlight both positive steps being taken and the utility of the framework in ensuring emergent environmental paradigms avoid the pitfalls of the past. Viewing each dimension of oppression as moveable levers to promote antioppressive conservation futures, we conclude with a set of questions to help conservation and environmental management scientists and practitioners identify where oppression might be manifest in their own work, and begin to embody antioppressive practices.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2414948123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2414948123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012639493069875551}, {"title": "Religious markers reduce perceived trustworthiness in a Muslim-majority country", "authors": "Joshua Hellyer, Johanna Gereke, Ozan Aksoy, Emily Hellriegel, Reinhard Schunck", "abstract": "First impressions often hinge on visible cues, leading people to infer the trustworthiness of strangers from their appearance and dress. While religiosity is generally associated with greater perceived trustworthiness, little is known about how visible religious markers, such as clothing and grooming styles, shape trust judgments in Muslim-majority societies, where such signals are widespread and easily recognizable. We examine this question using a large-scale vignette experiment embedded in a nationally representative face-to-face survey in Turkey. By experimentally varying profile characteristics, we identify the causal effect of a Muslim headscarf or beard on perceived trustworthiness. Contrary to expectations, individuals displaying these religious badges are generally viewed as less trustworthy than otherwise identical profiles, even by highly religious respondents. Mediation analyses show that these effects arise because religious badges signal multiple attributes, not only religiosity but also political orientation and physical attractiveness—and that these inferred meanings differ by gender: women’s headscarves and men’s beards prompt distinct patterns of inference. These findings show that visible religious markers shape trust judgments through multivalent social inferences rather than perceived piety alone. The results highlight how observers draw on broader social and political associations when interpreting religious markers, providing evidence on how public expressions of religion affect everyday trust judgments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2512131123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2512131123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01776416329231356}, {"title": "Scaling laws for function diversity and specialization across socioeconomic and biological complex systems", "authors": "Vicky Chuqiao Yang, James Holehouse, Hyejin Youn, José Ignacio Arroyo, Sidney Redner, Geoffrey B.

In the absence of overarching principles, these properties have appeared domain-specific. Here, we introduce an empirical framework and a mathematical model for the diversification and specialization of functions across disparate systems, including bacteria, federal agencies, universities, corporations, and cities. We find that the number of functions grows sublinearly with system size, with exponents from 0.35 to 0.57, consistent with Heaps’ law. In contrast, cities exhibit logarithmic scaling. To explain these empirical findings, we generalize the Yule-Simon model by introducing two key parameters: a diversification parameter that characterizes how existing functions inhibit the creation of new ones and a specialization parameter that describes how a function’s attractiveness depends on its abundance. Our model enables cross-system comparisons, from microorganisms to metropolitan areas. The analysis suggests that what drives the creation of new functions depends on the system’s goals and structure: federal agencies tend to ensure comprehensive coverage of necessary functions; cities tend to slow the creation of new occupations as existing ones expand; and cells occupy an intermediate position. Once functions are introduced, their growth follows a remarkably universal pattern across all systems.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2509729123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2509729123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.22190074781542124}, {"title": "What is the general Welfare: Welfare economic perspectives on equity", "authors": "Charles F.

Individuals may hold heterogeneous private and distributional preferences. To enhance policy analysis, economists should specify social welfare functions that express the richness and variety of actual personal preferences. The possibilities are vast. I focus on preferences for equity. There has been much controversy regarding interpretation of equity, a term that public discourse has used in vague and conflicting ways.

In this study, we conducted a massive population-based comparison of the association between, on the one hand, threat appraisals and coping appraisals and, on the other hand, protection against actual infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. We built a unique Danish data infrastructure that links surveys of ~8% of the adult population (N = 386,633) with the individual results of the 123 million COVID-19 tests performed during 22 mo of the COVID-19 pandemic. Controlling for a comprehensive range of sociodemographic measures and employing panel data to bolster internal validity, we observe that stronger coping appraisals are consistently associated with lower individual probability of COVID-19 infection risk. We find no consistent evidence of a similar association for threat appraisals. Threat appraisals rather seem to index individual feelings of infection exposure.

I argue that the negative psychological costs associated with perceived relative deprivation lead individuals to prioritize immediate over long-term income gains. Consequently, those who perceive themselves as having low status are less likely to sacrifice a part of their current income to fund welfare policies with long-delayed benefits. I test this argument using two waves of the Life in Transition Survey and two more recent waves of the British Election Survey. In line with my argument, I find that, although a lower sense of subjective economic status correlates with preferences for reducing inequality, the lower individuals place themselves in the economic hierarchy, the less likely they are to support a tax increase to finance spending on education, poverty assistance, and healthcare. While subjective perceptions of low economic status increase demand for equality, they may also limit the government’s ability to redistribute economic resources if citizens are unwilling to share the burden of social welfare. The findings suggest a subjective limit to the scope conditions of welfare state reform and the politics of fiscal solidarity and redistribution.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00323217251414605", "doi": "10.1177/00323217251414605", "journal_full": "Political Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009927549963619664}, {"title": "The Impact of Active Engagement With Performance Information on Citizens Views on Public Services: A Budget Game Experiment", "authors": "Erasmus Häggblom, Bjorn Kleizen, Wouter Van Dooren", "abstract": "This study uses a budget game experiment to study the effects of active engagement with performance information on citizens' trust in public services and voice behavior regarding those services. Participants reviewed performance information on two fictional schools, one low‐performing and one high‐performing, after which some participants played the budget game. Participants who participated in the game expressed lower trust in and higher subjective voice regarding both the low‐performing and high‐performing school than participants given only a short description of the schools, with a particularly strong effect on the higher‐performing school.

Proponents claim that PBB provides fresh opportunities to inject equity considerations into goal‐setting, prioritizing, and allocating activities via public engagement and direct minority representation among elected and appointed officials. This study examines these claims by exploring the budgetary reallocation of 32 early‐adopting PBB municipalities through multiple regression analysis, finding that differing levels of minority population do not dramatically affect the average departmental budgetary reallocation during PBB implementation. However, those with one or more racial minority council members experience a substantially lower level of reallocation than those that do not; the same holds true for organizations with 10% or more minority senior managers. The findings invite public budgeting scholars to revisit theories regarding community diversity, minority representation, budgetary conflict, urban power dynamics, majority–minority politics, and budgetary allocation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/padm.70046", "doi": "10.1111/padm.70046", "journal_full": "Public Administration", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005350248817416303}, {"title": "Holding AI Accountable Like Herding Cats: The Contingent Impact on the Legitimacy of Algorithmic Bureaucracy", "authors": "Ruoxuan Liu, Yanbing Han", "abstract": "The rise of artificial intelligence in public decision‐making is reshaping state legitimacy by shifting administrative discretion from human bureaucracies to algorithmic systems.

Using three survey experiments with 1135 participants in China, we find that accountability is most crucial when AI decisions introduce losses to citizens, whereas effectiveness plays a greater role when outcomes are positive to them. Additionally, the interaction effects between AI accountability and effectiveness are also contingent on decision outcomes.

While previous studies have established that general capacity impacts public organizations' performance, the role of service‐specific administrative capacity remains underexplored. Local conditions demonstrate the importance of assessing specific capacity, as some municipalities effectively deliver services of varying complexity due to specialized resources, including political support, while others fail due to uniform allocation and poor task understanding. This research uses nested qualitative fieldwork methods to examine municipal waste management, comparing simple waste collection with complex waste disposal, to explore the mechanisms through which service‐specific administrative capacity influences performance.

We find that collaborative governance is associated with reducing racial and ethnic disparities in financial barriers to visiting a doctor after 3 years of implementation and that such effects grow stronger over time. In addition, the estimated effect of collaborative governance on having a personal doctor is greatest for Hispanics.

Competing hypotheses are proposed and tested to assess whether governors with significant business experience enhance or hinder budgetary outcomes. Using a panel dataset of 48 states spanning 1960–2010 and a regression discontinuity design, the analysis finds that electing governors with high‐level business experience leads to improved budget equilibrium during their terms.

Yet, underlying this stability lies a dramatic change such that a partisan gap has emerged, with Democrats exhibiting substantially more trust than Republicans. Fifty years ago, Republicans in fact exhibited more relative trust in scientists. This article explains this continuity and change. First, we demonstrate that the demographic correlates of trust in scientists have been remarkably stable for more than a half century: women, Black, rural, religious, non-college educated, and lower/working-class individuals exhibit less trust than their counterparts. Second, we show that the partisan relationship with trust in scientists has flipped (over that same time period) as low-trusting demographic strata shifted partisan allegiances. This is particularly the case when it comes to education and religiosity. Concomitant with the emergent partisan gap is a massive perceptual gap among Democrats, who perceive a partisan divide more than double its actual size. Democrats vastly underestimate Republicans’ trust in scientists.

Reconstructing the wartime mobility histories of the surviving population, we examine the consequences of multiple displacement trajectories within a unified framework. First, we characterize the education and sectoral employment of the universe of (non-)displaced. Second, we exploit differences in relocation trajectories among extended kin members during their schooling years. Displacement is associated with significant gains in education. Third, employing a “movers design,” we show that minors displaced earlier to better districts experienced an increase in educational attainment. Focusing on moves during the intensification of the war and when comparing members of the same household, regional childhood exposure effects remain strong, whereas spatial sorting becomes negligible. Fourth, we jointly estimate place-based, spatial sorting, and uprootedness effects, showing that all forces are at play. Fifth, a small survey in Mozambique’s largest northern city reveals long-term effects: internally displaced report higher education than their siblings who stayed behind, but lower social capital and worse mental health relative to locals.

We investigate the relative impact of instrumental, relational, and moral bases of legitimacy on subordinates’ assessments of their workplace authorities’ propriety.

We also provide new algorithms for this dynamic clustering that optimize global objectives, with optional constraints on the transitions of entities across clusters.

Our findings reveal stark disparities: White adults largely follow traditional patterns, spending most of their later years married and living with a spouse. In contrast, Black adults experience the shortest durations of marriage and spousal coresidence, spending much of later life alone or with nonspouse family members.

However, this relationship has never been studied among an enslaved population, who encountered extremely harsh living conditions. Examining this relationship among different populations may reveal similarities and differences across contexts. The present study addresses this gap by examining the life courses of children born between 1830 and 1863 and enslaved in Suriname (n = 19,095 children) and their mothers. For the period 1848‒1863, we can also observe matrilineal kin, including grandmothers, aunts, and uncles (n = 12,020 children). The relationships of matrilineal kin's presence and children's hazard of death from ages 6 months to 12 years were analyzed with Cox proportional hazards models. Experiencing maternal death was related to an increased hazard of death for children throughout childhood, but particularly during infancy (ages 6 months to 1 year; hazard ratio: 6.24, 95% confidence interval: 3.34‒11.66), and it decreased as children aged. The presence of grandmothers was related to a decreased hazard of death among children aged 1‒5, and the presence of aunts and uncles was beneficial to survival for children aged 5‒12. Mothers were especially important to children's survival, particularly during infancy, likely due to the importance of maternal care and breastfeeding on survival. During childhood, however, it appears that the presence of extended kin was also important, implying that children's care could have been provided by other family members once children were weaned. These findings closely align with those of other studies and reflect the importance of extended kin networks on childhood survival across time and space.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-12446726", "doi": "10.1215/00703370-12446726", "journal_full": "Demography", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0557978089934168}, {"title": "Beyond Income: Health, Wealth, and Racial Welfare Gaps Among Older Americans", "authors": "Sayorn Chin, Ray Miller", "abstract": "We estimate racial and ethnic disparities in well-being among older Americans using longitudinal data and an expected utility framework that incorporates differences in consumption, leisure, health, mortality, and wealth.

Decomposition exercises show that a majority of the estimated welfare gaps are determined by age 60 initial conditions as opposed to racial and ethnic differences in dynamic processes after age 60.

I estimate how this indicator has evolved between 1950 and 2021 across regions of SSA and show how the measure correlates with polygyny estimates from available men's and women's Demographic and Health Surveys. Gamma shows inverted U-curve patterns aligned with stages of the demographic transition, from modestly low levels to high levels during periods of rapid population growth and then declining again. Recent declines are starkest in South SSA, while potential remains moderate elsewhere. Gamma correlates positively with polygyny estimates from Demographic and Health Surveys—particularly in Central and South SSA—and can explain up to 50‒70% variation in polygyny, albeit not everywhere.

Statistical and machine learning models report comparable accuracy and relatively high discriminative performance, but they fail to account for most lifespan heterogeneity at the individual level. We observe consistent inequalities in mortality predictability and risk discrimination, with lower accuracy for men, non-Hispanic Blacks, and low-educated individuals.

Although less severe than imprisonment, subfelony contact also carries damaging and lifelong consequences. Using more than 25 years of administrative criminal record data from Texas, this study estimates the prevalence of both subfelony and felony arrest, prosecution, conviction, and incarceration across five cohorts of Black, White, and Hispanic men and women born between 1971 and 1995. Findings show that subfelony contact is 3‒18 times as prevalent, and far more widely distributed across the population, as felony conviction and incarceration: fewer than 3% of Black women go to prison by age 24, but at least 22% are arrested at least once.

War and other forms of interstate competition for power may increase the salience of national identity, but the effect may be weak if the nation is divided. Empirical evidence of a trade‐off between national (superordinate) and subnational (subordinate) identification during times of crisis is sparse. We present an experimental framework to measure effects of external threat on national identification in the United States, exploring whether effects are driven by attachment to the nation (ingroup love), hostility toward other nations (outgroup hate), or both simultaneously. We find that even in a context of partisan polarization, external threat strengthens national identification, expressed mainly as increased hostility toward the national outgroup. National identification need not come at the expense of salient partisan identities as long as these are not perceived to be in competition with the national identity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70038", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70038", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011624435812879086}, {"title": "Issue Information", "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70044", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70044", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0027218923854216426}, {"title": null, "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.v70.1", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.v70.1", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.003622161775539534}, {"title": "Balancing Face-to-Face and Digital Communication: The Role of Relationship Maintenance in Dual-Earning Families", "authors": "Tamara D.

Guided by the theory of resilience and relational load (TRRL), we test how ongoing FtF and CMC maintenance behaviors predicted well-being across a week among 62 families (i.e., two parents and one adolescent). Using a week-long daily diary and physiological measures (cortisol and IL-6 assays), we assess perceived stress, mental health, and loneliness. Findings suggest that both FtF and CMC maintenance are associated with lower stress and better well-being, with FtF showing somewhat stronger associations on certain outcomes such as loneliness. Additionally, perceived gaps between desired and received maintenance predicted higher and more erratic stress and diminished mental health, underscoring the importance of meeting relational needs. These results highlight how families balance FtF and digital maintenance in everyday life and extend the TRRL by incorporating mixed-media contexts and perceived maintenance gaps.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00936502251412924", "doi": "10.1177/00936502251412924", "journal_full": "Communication Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005714661370482821}, {"title": "The elsewhere is Black: ecological violence &amp; improvised life", "authors": "Jade Nixon", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2026.2623159", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2026.2623159", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03805854737957548}, {"title": "Inhabitants of the deep: the blueness of Blackness", "authors": "William Brown", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2026.2623163", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2026.2623163", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.12462133814506915}, {"title": "Anti-racism, multiculturalism and human rights: reconceiving the politics of diversity in employment and education", "authors": "Lieve Gies", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2026.2629598", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2026.2629598", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9665918214663073}, {"title": "Transnational repression in an age of global authoritarianism: experiences of Uyghur diaspora activists in Sweden", "authors": "Michel Harb, Arne F.

Drawing on expectancy–value theory, this study examines whether civic motivations in early adolescence (ages 13–16) including political efficacy, perceived political knowledge, political interest, and civic norms are associated with electoral participation in early adulthood (ages 26–29). Using a longitudinal dataset from Sweden, we show that civic norms are the strongest predictor of adult voting, even after accounting for prior participation, socioeconomic background, and immigrant origin. In contrast, expectancy‐based beliefs do not independently predict turnout, suggesting that value‐based motivations may have greater long‐term relevance for electoral participation. Sex‐specific analyses reveal clear differences. Among women, adult electoral participation is associated with a broader constellation of civic motivations, whereas men's participation is primarily predicted by prior voting and structural background factors. Immigrant origin strongly reduces participation for both male and female respondents, but the effect is more pronounced among women, consistent with intersectional disadvantage. Overall, the findings demonstrate that civic motivations held in adolescence have lasting implications for adult electoral participation and underscore the importance of gender‐sensitive, intersectional approaches to understanding political development.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70117", "doi": "10.1111/pops.70117", "journal_full": "Political Psychology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006359625814893022}, {"title": "When survival becomes politics: Necessity activism and identity work under precarity", "authors": "Lucia Garcia‐Lorenzo, Lucia Sell‐Trujillo, Paul Donnelly", "abstract": "Collective action is essential for tackling social, institutional, and environmental challenges, often fueled by shared identities, common norms, and a belief in the possibility of change.

Using an instrumental-variable approach to analyzing data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2019–2023), we examine the impact of partners’ online banking use on who manages the couple’s money and controls major financial decisions. We reveal an ‘empowering effect’ whereby one’s use of online banking bolsters their control of both money management and major financial decisions, and this effect is particularly pronounced when one’s partner does not use online banking. Online banking similarly bolsters the power of women and men in money management, but subtle gender differences are observed in financial decision-making. Whereas online banking increases men’s exclusive control of major financial decisions, it bolsters women’s exclusive or joint control of such decisions. We also find an ‘individualizing effect’ whereby both women’s and men’s use of online banking increases the likelihood of partners’ independent money management, and independent money management is least likely when only one partner uses online banking.

However, if we focus on autocratization as democratic erosion or decline, such a trend is not matched by an equivalent increase in the number of democratic breakdowns or autocracies. Why (and how) do some democracies survive autocratization, while others do not? Current research on autocratization has recently turned toward studies on democratic endurance. In particular, mostly large-N contributions focusing on structural factors protecting democracy from autocratization onset (democratic resilience) have lately been complemented by numerous small-N contributions exploring concrete actions that can stop ongoing autocratization processes before democratic breakdown (democratic resistance). However, due to its necessarily limited scope, such qualitative evidence on democratic resistance may be subject to internal and external validity issues. Therefore, we systematically advance the research on resistance to autocratization within a comparative framework. Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we examine 69 autocratization episodes that began in democracies in the 21st century (2000–23). Our analysis reveals the combinations of institutional, political, social, and external conditions of democratic resistance that impede democratic collapse during autocratization episodes. While the success of individual actions is mainly context-specific, we demonstrate that it is the cooperation across various areas of resistance ( unity makes strength ) that characterizes the multiple, and cross-nationally robust, sufficient configurations of democratic survival during autocratization processes. Through alternative analytical choices, robustness tests, and integration of sources, we bolster the validity of prior studies on democratic resistance to autocratization and point to further research avenues.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676525100595", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676525100595", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010759264895801701}, {"title": "Everything for the fans: Party responsiveness across the EU over time", "authors": "Felix Lehmann", "abstract": "Are parties responsive to public opinion and, if so, to whom exactly?

Unlike most extant studies, I do not limit my analysis to Western European countries and the left-right dimension but examine party responsiveness across the entire EU with a focus on six key issues. Conceptually, I draw on two responsiveness frameworks that are concerned with distinct ways through which parties can change their position to align with the general electorate or their partisan supporters. The standard framework tests whether parties shift in the same direction as the public, whereas the congruent responsiveness framework focuses on whether parties reduce past incongruencies with the public. Using updated expert and voter survey time-series data for the period between 1999 and 2024, I show that parties are primarily responsive to their supporters. The uncovered patterns of responsiveness are consistent across responsiveness frameworks, issues, European regions, and time. Both mainstream and niche parties primarily respond to their supporters.

Against this broader background, our study analyses the influence of 10 years of EU visual social media communication on user engagement as an indicator of successfully creating visibility in a crucial communication space. For this purpose, we conducted an image-type analysis, combining quantitative and qualitative features of visual analysis: First, a subsample of posts was inductively analysed to identify recurring image types and subsequently used to implement a manual quantitative visual content analysis. Building on the results, we drew on a machine learning approach, allowing us to analyse over 40,000 posts, including more than 20,000 pictures.

If so, one can hardly imagine a more consequential development for understanding the electoral behavior of Western publics. However, previous evidence suggesting such attachments are important (and growing) comes from a small number of single-case studies. In this paper, we expand the evidentiary basis for this idea by implementing a method that leverages existing survey data to test whether citizens in western democracies, over a long time period, have developed such group-based attachments. Specifically, we use surveys in which respondents place parties on the left-right scale to test for the existence of an out-group homogeneity effect between potential Left and Right identifiers. We argue that this pattern provides compelling indirect evidence of such group attachments and shows that the effect is both widespread across western democracies and increasing over time. As a proof of concept, we fielded original surveys in Denmark, Italy, and Sweden and found that our direct Left/Right attachment measures are strongly associated with the indirect evidence documented in our cross-national analyses. Thus, this paper provides an empirically justified call for scholars to invest in the development of appropriate survey batteries that directly measure affective attachments to the Left and Right in a large set of countries.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s147567652610070x", "doi": "10.1017/s147567652610070x", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.025401322291921824}, {"title": "Stories told before: intertextuality in policy narratives on men’s violence against women", "authors": "Hilda Broqvist", "abstract": "This article introduces the concept of intertextuality to the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF).

In contrast to this voluminous literature, political scientists have given relatively little attention to an emerging phenomenon in contemporary party politics: the mobilization via “emigrant party branches” of partisans living outside of the territorial borders of their native country. We address this gap in the literature through an analysis of Democrats Abroad—the official overseas arm of the US Democratic Party—during the 2024 election cycle. Drawing from an original two-wave panel survey of party members, we demonstrate that some of the forces that prompt campaign activism in the domestic United States hold for partisans overseas. At the same time, factors pertaining to the migration experience and settlement in another country also affect engagement in American campaigns. Most notably, we find that overseas Democrats who become integrated into the party system of their residential country are more likely to participate in American elections from the distance. This finding contributes a fresh perspective to models of political transnationalism and “campaign spillover” in electoral research—that is, the impact that partisan engagement in one context has on subsequent involvement in separate domains.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096525101728", "doi": "10.1017/s1049096525101728", "journal_full": "PS: Political Science & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06030307648091693}, {"title": "How the Experience of Administrative Burdens Affects Clients’ Psychological Well-being: The Role of Negativity Bias", "authors": "Jaeyeong Nam, Pamela Herd, Sebastian Jilke, Donald Moynihan", "abstract": "A core claim of the administrative burden literature is that the experience of frictions during administrative encounters can generate psychological costs. Using a split-ballot survey experiment with a question order design (n = 3,812), we show that being asked to recall administrative encounters in a welfare program negatively affects people's psychological affect. Further, we show that the responses to burdens are asymmetric and consistent with a pattern of negativity bias in how people recall citizen-state encounters. Being asked to recall encounters induces negative affect, even though the majority of respondents reported having experienced low levels of administrative burden. Respondents' negative psychological reactions are driven by individuals who rated their experience as burdensome in survey questions or reported a bad experience in open-ended responses. Positive reported experiences were not associated with more positive affect. The results also suggest that the relationship between the experience of burden and negative affect is more pronounced for women, liberals, Whites, and those in poor or fair health. Moreover, those with neutral political ideology and those in very good or excellent health experienced decreased positive affect. A key theoretical implication is that the experience of psychological costs is shaped by negativity bias: negative interactions have a larger effect on outcomes than positive interactions. A practical implication is that governments should focus attention on reducing burdensome or otherwise negative encounters.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muag004", "doi": "10.1093/jopart/muag004", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007851128240113914}, {"title": "Hearing, Not Heeding: Procedural Acknowledgment and Substantive Influence in Rulemaking", "authors": "Alexander Love", "abstract": "Public participation processes promise that citizens will be heard, but rarely guarantee they will be heeded. This distinction between procedural acknowledgment and substantive influence lies at the heart of bureaucratic responsiveness, yet these two forms of responsiveness are often conflated in empirical research. I demonstrate that in federal rulemaking, procedural acknowledgment (being heard) is empirically distinct from substantive policy influence (being heeded). Drawing on theories of bureaucratic responsiveness, I argue that agencies strategically cite commenters not primarily to signal agreement but to build defensible administrative records that satisfy procedural requirements while preserving their policy autonomy. Analyzing 854 federal rules from 2017 to 2023, I use semantic text analysis to track changes in binding regulatory provisions distinct from the explanatory preamble. I show that agencies systematically cite comments they ultimately reject, particularly from well-resourced groups. Roughly two-thirds of comment citations are not accompanied by any responsive change to the regulatory text. This reveals that procedural responsiveness can function as a strategic substitute for substantive policy change. These findings suggest that procedural engagement and substantive influence operate as distinct modes of bureaucratic responsiveness, with agencies often prioritizing legal defensibility over policy adaptation when facing potential judicial review.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muag003", "doi": "10.1093/jopart/muag003", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004793032730248448}, {"title": "An Ideologue by Any Other Name?

Using foreign policy positions as a “low-information” environment in which respondents should be more susceptible to cues, we find that some partisans rate support for policy statements lower when they are attributed to politicians from the opposite party.

The literature tends to emphasize education’s democratizing potential. However, mass schooling in autocracies also facilitates pro-government propaganda, which may undermine the democratic character of mass mobilization in contexts where the regime uses education for indoctrination. This article builds on previous experimental findings to evaluate the correlation between regime indoctrination efforts through schooling and mass mobilization using expert assessments and observational data. Analyzing autocratic spells from 1950 to 2019, we find that educational indoctrination correlates with reduced mass mobilization. Specifically, autocracies investing in indoctrination show weaker pro-democracy movements and are less likely to experience anti-system uprisings. Conversely, educational indoctrination correlates with mobilization for autocracy, indicating it helps solidify authoritarian regimes against democratic pressures and promotes regime-compatible demonstrations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129261422734", "doi": "10.1177/10659129261422734", "journal_full": "Political Research Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012405317136531036}, {"title": "Democracy and the Commemorated Other: Public Memory, Status Threat, and Democratic Backsliding Among White Americans", "authors": "Alexandra Filindra, Beyza E.

This study examines whether symbolic disputes can erode democratic commitments by fostering political intolerance and whether they do so by shifting the boundaries of inclusion in the “imagined community.” Across two survey experiments, we find that proposals to replace White-centered commemorations with more inclusive alternatives trigger support for undemocratic penalties (e.g., investigations, civil liberties restrictions) among racially conservative White Americans. We also show that racial liberals respond similarly when tsymbols consistent with their own identity are targeted. We find that such threats reliably shift respondents away from strong opposition to undemocratic penalties and toward ambivalence, even in the absence of elite cues. Finally, we demonstrate that this is enabled by reclassifying opponents as “unamerican” and “undemocratic,” thus shifting the boundaries of inclusion in the imagined community.

We address this question by building a two-region innovation-driven growth model with endogenous technology diffusion via FDI. We use the model to analyse R&amp;D subsidy cooperation in the EU, which has a common trade and monetary policy but where a coordinated innovation policy is still in its infancy. Stark differences in innovation capabilities between the West (old member states) and the East (new member states) shape optimal policies. Western countries have higher R&amp;D efficiency and serve as primary sources of knowledge spillovers, through FDI-driven technology transfer. Cooperation is driven by two factors: correcting distortions from subsidy competition, the strategic motive, and leveraging intertemporal knowledge spillovers that sustain growth. A coordinated policy involves substantial subsidies for the West and taxes for the East, reflecting the West’s superior R&amp;D efficiency and role as a key source of knowledge spillovers. Both regions experience welfare gains, primarily by internalising cross-border spillovers.

An 1894 reform removed institutional features—a graduated franchise, property qualifications, the absence of a secret ballot, and the participation of unelected magistrates—that allowed landowners to control spending on poor relief after the 1832 Great Reform Act. The empirical analysis uses a new annual dataset of poor law spending from 1884–1905 to test whether higher pre-reform inequality amplified the effect of democratic reform on redistribution. The results support the Meltzer–Richard hypothesis: higher local income inequality led to higher poor relief spending after 1894. Areas where landed elites held political power saw smaller increases in expenditure, indicating that de facto elite influence muted the effect of democratization.

Drawing on a unique data set covering all household relocations in Vienna between 2011 and 2018, we examine whether the movements of the top income quintile (Q5) reflect a broader ‘retreat of the rich’ to affluent clusters and, if so, how these mobility patterns influence both citywide and localized segregation. Using a combination of global and local dissimilarity indices, as well as a novel scenario‐based approach, we isolate the effects of intra‐urban mobility, income status change and in‐migration. The results show that Q5 households are consistently the most segregated group, and while they mostly tend to move between affluent areas, their mobility alone does not fully explain segregation trends. Instead, we find that the selective out‐migration of lower‐income groups from the same areas plays a critical role in reinforcing segregation. Local scenario analyses reveal that Q5 mobility can either increase or reduce segregation, depending on the spatial context, challenging simple narratives of a retreat of the rich. These findings underscore the importance of analysing segregation as a dynamic, multi‐scalar process shaped by the intersecting mobility patterns of all income groups, even in cities with inclusive housing regimes like Vienna.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70223", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70223", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08189341846110987}, {"title": "Critical Camp Studies: A State of the Art", "authors": "Alex T.

It investigates the loneliness reports of older African adults in the South African context, where out‐migrants are reported as retaining membership in their household of origin. An analysis of household survey data collected in the National Income Dynamics Study shows that between 2008 and 2017, almost 30% of older ( ≥ 60 years) African adults in South Africa lived in a household that was “stretched” (it included at least one household member not physically resident in the household). At the unconditional mean, older adults in these households are significantly less likely than other older African adults to report feeling lonely. This relationship exists independently of whether the older person's household receives private transfers (including remittance income). A series of ordered probit regressions shows that lower loneliness reports derive from sizeable differences in household characteristics. In comparison to older African adults in other households, those in stretched households are far more likely to live with children and working‐age adults. These characteristics are significant protectors of the loneliness of older adults, and once they are accounted for, there is no further association between living in a stretched household and the loneliness of older adults.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70220", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70220", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9857486744457781}, {"title": "Interplay of Agency and Structure on Upskilling: A Case of Filipino Migrant Nurses in the UAE", "authors": "Jiin Kim", "abstract": "With an increased number of migrant nurses from the Global South to the North, the deskilling of migrant nurses has been a problem.

Findings demonstrate that Filipino migrant nurses who majored in nursing due to external factors, such as parental pressure or social trends, tend to improve their professional and soft skills after migrating to the UAE, which offers abundant resources, thereby demonstrating their agency. Furthermore, migrant nurses developed a positive perception of themselves, actively recommending migration to those around them, while also voicing their criticisms of the Filipino medical system.

While return migration in China is often attributed to structural barriers, this research highlights the agency of migrant women in actively shaping their migration trajectories. Using Constructivist Grounded Theory methods, the study draws on in‐depth interviews with twelve young migrant mothers (seven participated in follow‐up interviews one year later), revealing that aspirations for return migration emerge early but become more concrete after childbirth. Our findings suggest that return migration is not merely a response to exclusion but a strategic decision influenced by multi‐local capabilities, familial responsibilities, and aspirations for a better life. Migrant mothers exercise adaptive agency by strategically navigating settlement choices across both rural and urban locations. Rather than viewing return as a failure, this study conceptualises it as an evolving and relational process of place‐making, shaped by gendered expectations and ongoing mobility.

The disadvantage faced by, and systematic societal failure to support, disabled and neurodiverse children has become increasingly visible within political and media debates, yet is largely overlooked within geography and broader social sciences. We present original findings demonstrating that increasing proportions of children are being educated in segregated special schools, and that these geographies are uneven at the local (Local Authority) scale, despite a stated presumption of mainstream education, dating back to 1989 and within existing legislation (Children and Families Act, 2014). Time and spatial trends in the school provision of children with SEND are analysed using multilevel longitudinal models and panel data at Local Authority scale. Critically, location is pivotal to whether children attend segregated special schools. The spatial difference is tied to: the proportions of children with statutory support, Local Authorities with higher levels of income deprivation affecting children, and the types of labels/experiences of ‘need’—particularly the increasing number of children on the autism spectrum.

Precarious legal status is demarcated by hierarchies of legal and social membership and degrees of exclusion. Within the context of legal precarity, we explore the coping strategies used by forced migrants preceding and during the COVID‐19 period in Italy. Our analysis focuses on interviews with 31 asylum claimants. We find that forced migrants experienced protracted legal liminality and precarity characterised by extended time spent in migration camps, unpredictable legal status determination, and, more broadly, imperfect knowledge. In particular, their legal precarity was formed or shaped by a fluctuating legal and bureaucratic system, the suspension of asylum determination processes, and the closure of institutions due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The cumulative impact affected their well‐being and limited their full participation in society. This paper's key contribution is in identifying strategies employed in response. Individuals employed social network support, physical exercises, faith, and cognitive reframing of the legal difficulties to cope with prolonged precarious legal precarity.

While workers' trajectories are shaped by shifting production demands, low wages, housing insecurity, and limited social protection, as well as familial obligations and life events, we find that they actively recalibrate their livelihood strategies and focus on gaining stability through informal income activities, support networks, and future‐oriented planning. Rather than viewing workers as passive subjects of exploitation, our study contributes to scholarship on precarious labour and migration by showing how economic survival, emotional well‐being, and aspirational agency are dynamically interwoven and negotiated over time.

To address this methodological challenge, we use the random allocation of public housing in Hong Kong as a natural experiment.

We find that individuals' pre‐determined socioeconomic and demographic characteristics are uncorrelated with the social cohesion of the neighbourhoods where residents are placed, which confirms the validity of our research design. Based on the design, we find that neighbourhood cohesion is positively associated with residents' life satisfaction and happiness, while it is also negatively associated with mental distress.

Drawing on a novel survey of U.S. state labor departments, new measures of statutory strength in wage‐hour laws, and state‐level estimates of minimum wage violations, we find widespread nonuse of available powers. This misalignment of powers and practices has substantive consequences: the predicted probability of minimum wage violation falls sharply as strategic enforcement practices increase, conditional on strong labor laws.

We then examined how trust and influence aspirations jointly contributed to citizens' social media behaviour during the COVID‐19 pandemic. The findings showed that aspirations to influence declined during the crisis, particularly among those with high political trust. In contrast, individuals with low trust typically maintained their influence aspirations and were more likely to engage on social media and to criticise public authorities. High political trust, on the other hand, did not promote criticism but was instead positively associated with support.

This article offers a formal analysis of such pre-event/post-event survey comparisons, including designs that seek to reduce bias using quota sampling, rolling cross-sections, and panels. Our analysis distinguishes major sources of bias and clarifies the comparative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. We then introduce a modified panel design—the dual randomized survey—to reduce bias in cases where asking respondents to complete the same survey twice could impact their Wave 2 responses. Our formalization of bias and novel research design improve scholars’ ability to study the causal impact of events through surveys.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2026.10088", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2026.10088", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010770141737571626}, {"title": "Rebels in the house: Do anti-elitist parties vote differently?", "authors": "Simon Otjes, Luc Vorsteveld", "abstract": "Do anti-elitist parties behave differently in parliament than other parties? Existing evidence is inconclusive: some studies suggest that anti-elitist parties do not show a shared voting pattern as this is mainly structured by their left- or right-wing ideology.

In order to address this question, we develop a new method that allows one to look at different explanations of voting concurrently while also taking into account characteristics of the vote. We find that anti-elitist parties do vote in a similar way and different from other parties, but only on legislative votes. As such, we present a major step forward in our understanding of and methodological approach to parliamentary voting behavior.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2026.10090", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2026.10090", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016017831232635782}, {"title": "KoTaP: A Panel Dataset for Corporate Tax Avoidance, Performance, and Governance in Korea", "authors": "Hyungjong Na, Wonho Song, Seungyong Han, Donghyeon Jo, Sejin Myung, Hyungjoon Kim", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06722-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06722-5", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011697602874364832}, {"title": "Revealing urban residents’ ecosystem service preferences in China: Evidence from a nationwide survey", "authors": "Shuyao Wu, Delong Li, Lumeng Liu, Zhonghao Zhang", "abstract": "Characterizing ecosystem services demand (ESD) is key to understanding the diverse preferences for various benefits from nature. However, direct evidence of the variations in ESDs among different groups of people and places remains limited. Here, a national-scale dataset of ESDs derived from a non-probabilistic survey of 20,075 urban residents across 31 provinces in China is presented. The dataset captures preferences for nine typical urban ecosystem services using a point-allotment experiment, where participants allocated a total of 100 importance points to prioritize ESDs. Key findings reveal significant variations in ESDs, with air purification receiving the highest average importance point (22.17), followed by recreation (15.60) and local climate regulation (13.62). This pattern of variation in ESDs is evident in 28 of 31 provinces. The dataset also includes detailed socioeconomic and environmental metadata, enabling further analyses of regional disparities and their drivers among ESDs. This resource offers exploratory insights into tailoring urban design and ecosystem management strategies to diverse societal needs, thereby advancing sustainable land use planning and ESD research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06689-3", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06689-3", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.05438808876575307}, {"title": "Multiclass Dataset for Intelligent Detection of Wind Turbine Blade Defects Using Drone Imagery", "authors": "Lipeng Ji, Junjie Cheng, Shilong Wu", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06762-x", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06762-x", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011319779730083801}, {"title": "Correction: Sea lice infestation dataset for wild and farmed salmon populations on the Pacific coast of Canada (2001–2023)", "authors": "Crawford W.

We find that “Gendered Insults” exhibits the highest betweenness centrality, acting as a structural bridge connecting disparate frustrations. Women-targeting topics are both speakable and resonant within the community, anchored by a self-deprecating “sewer mouse” masculinity that navigates opportunity structures. Interviews reveal that when political opportunity structures remain closed while discursive and mediated (legacy platform) opportunities stay relatively accessible, misogyny becomes a functional language for channeling widespread socioeconomic anxieties.

The article introduces the concept of institutionalized sharenting to describe the processes through which sharenting becomes routinized and legitimized, enabling industry actors to capitalize on children’s presence while displacing full responsibility onto parents. This deflection is enacted through a variety of practices, such as the inclusion of children via strategic collaborations with their parents, and is framed through discourses of authenticity, intensive parenting, and personal choice.

Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) may offer a real-time tool for assessing opinions to explore the relationship between differing viewpoints about the pandemic and how these differences impact the occurrence and severity of disease burden. Utilizing an open-source data set of 1.75 million keyword-selected X (Twitter) posts, updated weekly from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021, along with publicly available COVID-19 case and death counts and county-level data on election outcomes from the 2020 election, we analyzed how the volume of tweets on the X (Twitter) platform related to COVID-19 has changed over time and how patterns of use vary across the partisan divide. We discovered that Democratic-leaning counties exhibited higher X (Twitter) volume associated with COVID-19 topics compared to Republican-leaning counties in response to changes in case or death rates.

While Canada’s immigration policy prioritizes education and professional experience, these same credentials are often devalued upon arrival, as systemic barriers limit access to commensurate employment. This study examines the employment experiences of skilled, racialized immigrants in British Columbia, exploring how institutional narratives of meritocracy conceal exclusion, credential systems reinforce epistemic hierarchies, and settlement services pathologize migrant experiences. Using a qualitative design with four focus group discussions ( n = 18), the study integrates critical migration theory, intersectionality, and decolonial social work to analyze the structural marginalization of skilled, racialized immigrants. Findings reveal a central paradox: the very system that celebrates global talent simultaneously erodes its value through credential gatekeeping, discriminatory hiring practices, and labor market practices that privilege local over global expertise. By situating these barriers within broader colonial and epistemic hierarchies, the study argues that integration must be understood not as individual adaptation but as institutional transformation. It contributes to critical debates on skilled migration, equity, and the reproduction of colonial logics within Canada’s labor market.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2026.10057", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2026.10057", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9929019839633635}, {"title": "Political Disenfranchisement?

This has promulgated claims that felon disenfranchisement is used to limit Black political influence. However, we lack systematic evidence tying perceptions of racial political power to support for disenfranchising felons. Utilizing the racial threat framework, we argue that White Americans who perceive Black Americans as too politically powerful will be more supportive of disenfranchising felons, particularly right-leaning White Americans. Using data from the 2020 and 2024 ANES, we find perceptions of political threat are associated with greater support for felon disenfranchisement. In further support for the political racial threat hypothesis, we find perceptions of Black political power increase support among those on the political right while decreasing support among the political left. Importantly, these results hold after controlling for economic and symbolic threat, general Black affect, crime spending preferences, and Black population size. These results suggest political racial threat significantly influences support for felon disenfranchisement among White Americans, and conditionally on political leanings, underscoring the role of political racial threat in whether White Americans think felons should be allowed to vote.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10047", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10047", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01627930281438361}, {"title": "Race, Age, and Support for the Congressional Black Caucus", "authors": "Maneesh Arora, Jennifer R.

Specifically, the darker-skinned Black female candidate is evaluated more positively than her lighter-skinned female and darker-skinned male counterpart across multiple domains, including vote choice and expected job performance.

However, few studies have examined this trend in a timely and spatially comprehensive manner across diverse national contexts, particularly in response to the turbulence in migration patterns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we analyse spatial Facebook population data from 2020 to 2022 across 35 countries to characterise two forms of population redistribution: shifts between urban and rural areas, and changes along the urban density gradient. During the early response phase of the pandemic, broader country-level trends of urban-to-rural redistribution and intra-urban deconcentration were evident. However, 20% and 4.8% of these trends, respectively, were temporary and reversed during the later phase of the pandemic. The extent and direction of these patterns varied across countries and were negatively associated with the Human Development Index, suggesting that developed nations experienced greater urban depopulation and spatial deconcentration. Our findings reveal a potential misalignment between population redistribution and existing physical urban densities in certain countries, as densely built-up areas are experiencing outflows, highlighting the need for adaptive urban planning strategies to address evolving population dynamics and related sustainability challenges.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-026-00351-y", "doi": "10.1038/s42949-026-00351-y", "journal_full": "npj Urban Sustainability", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.6348569292106334}, {"title": "The case for collaborative urban adaptation", "authors": "Hallie Eakin", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-026-00341-0", "doi": "10.1038/s42949-026-00341-0", "journal_full": "npj Urban Sustainability", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.050272384957044336}, {"title": "Seeking protection in times of turbulence: A methodology to assess and optimise the location of indoor climate shelters", "authors": "A.

It proposes targeted improvements, emphasising the role of places of worship, schools, and subway entrances. When this refined “Bilbao Strategy” is extrapolated to 131 cities across different continents, climate zones, and colonial legacies, it achieves over 60% of maximum potential coverage in 74.81% of cases and exceeds 40% in 96.18%.

The stimuli were presented in two blocks, and participants took the PANAS mood questionnaire before and after each block. Between blocks, they viewed a mood induction video that increased their happiness, increased their sadness, or left their mood unchanged. Participants completed the Questionnaire for Cognitive and Affective Empathy. We used path modeling to test the effect of empathy score on beauty ratings, felt happiness and sadness (mood questionnaire ratings), and perceived happiness and sadness (stimulus ratings). We find that higher-empathy participants find music and images more beautiful (b = 0.40 and 0.22, respectively, on a 10-pt scale, p &lt; 0.001), and they perceive stronger emotion in these stimuli (b = 0.3, p &lt; 0.001). We also compare empathy to traits more commonly studied in empirical aesthetics: openness to experience, sensitivity to aesthetic reward, and art expertise. Empathy boosts perceived beauty and emotion at least as much as the other traits do. While the empirical study of empathy mainly focuses on one’s response to the emotions of other people, we here quantify the effect of empathy on one’s perception of objects.

Our results show that the multi-dimensional structure and the relative importance (i.e., loadings) of seven internally- and externally-focused facets of calling in defining the construct are equivalent across cultures and that the overall level of calling is higher in non-Western countries.

Since category size and interests of a child influence word-object association learning, we hypothesized that a child’s interest might also modulate attention during word-object recognition. 24- to 38-month-old children’s familiar word-object recognition was measured in an intermodal preferential looking paradigm. Category interest was assessed via pupillary arousal. Additionally, interest in and familiarity with a category and category size were obtained from parents. Children looked longer to the correct target upon hearing its label, and target looking increased with age and category size. Children quickly recognised the target, and this ability was independent of other measures.

In response to fiscal crisis and bipartisan concern about mass incarceration, policymakers and reformers increasingly frame punishment as a form of financial investment, emphasizing cost efficiency, returns, and risk management. While this discourse has helped generate political support for reform, the article argues that “investment talk” subtly reshapes the terms of debate over punishment in ways that risk obscuring its political and normative dimensions. Drawing on political theory, criminology, and scholarship on conceptual metaphor and governance, the article analyzes how treating justice as a distributive or financial problem narrows public deliberation about the aims and limits of punishment. Investment talk, the article shows, encourages a focus on cost reduction and efficiency while sidelining questions of political agency, democratic accountability, proportionality, and social exclusion. Contrary to common assumptions, framing prison reform in terms of investment does not necessarily imply limited punishment; instead, it may legitimate new and expanded forms of penal control, including noncustodial and “virtual” sanctions, so long as they are perceived as generating acceptable returns. The article situates investment talk within broader critiques of neoliberal penality and argues that durable movements to reduce the scale and scope of punishment require a different normative vocabulary.

Drawing on year-long ethnographic fieldwork and a unique ten-year follow-up study, it analyzes life inside a community boarding school designed to intervene systematically in the everyday cultural practices of primarily Black and Latino children. The school seeks to promote mobility and stability by inducing a condition of social liminality—a sustained sense of being “in between” home and institution—through highly structured routines, disciplinary systems, and norms of self-presentation. Using an interpretive framework informed by work on total institutions, youth governance, and identity formation, the article shows how this strategy produces ambivalence rather than straightforward transformation. While students often adapt to institutional expectations and internalize messages about discipline, merit, and self-responsibility, they also develop secondary adaptations that reshape their relationships to family, community, and self. These adaptive responses persist into young adulthood, frequently generating a durable sense of disconnection from home communities even among those who “succeed” by institutional standards. The article contributes to scholarship on race and politics, youth socialization, and the governance of poverty by shifting attention from overt programmatic goals to the micro-level processes through which authority, culture, and care are negotiated. It argues that well-intentioned youth interventions can reproduce forms of exclusion by weakening social ties and reconfiguring identity under conditions of prolonged institutional control.

This article argues that punishment in the United States is increasingly governed through such submerged penal policies, producing what I term the submerged prison state. These arrangements channel public resources toward crime control objectives while obscuring lines of responsibility, redistributing costs and benefits, and entrenching private interests beyond the reach of ordinary democratic oversight. Drawing on legislative analysis, judicial decisions, policy documents, and public opinion research, the article shows how submerged penal policies generate revenue for some actors, cut costs for others, and expand the carceral state without explicit public authorization. Because these policies rely on indirect mechanisms—such as tax credits, subsidies, and liability shields—they distort citizens’ perceptions of the scale, distributional consequences, and governance of punishment. The result is a politics of crime control marked by low visibility, weak accountability, and limited public learning, even as coercive state power expands. The article situates the submerged prison state within broader debates on privatization, regulation, and democratic legitimacy, arguing that submerged governance poses distinctive risks to public trust and civic capacity. By obscuring how punishment is funded and administered, submerged penal policies undermine citizens’ ability to attribute responsibility, evaluate alternatives, and contest the organization of the carceral system.

Democratic participation, critics argue, distorts criminal justice policy by amplifying fear, revenge, and moral panic, producing punitive outcomes divorced from legitimate penological purposes. This article critically examines that insulationist consensus. Drawing on political theory, philosophy of law, and empirical research on public opinion, policy feedback, and penal populism, it argues that the case for insulating punishment from democratic influence is both empirically overstated and normatively misguided. The article analyzes a cluster of related claims commonly invoked by insulationists, focusing in particular on the idea that the public possesses a distinctive “taste for revenge” that undermines rational and just penal policymaking. It challenges this claim on three grounds. First, existing evidence does not support the view that lay publics are systematically more punitive than experts, nor that public punitiveness is uniquely irrational relative to other domains of democratic decision-making. Second, the article shows that phenomena such as moral panics, availability cascades, and penal populism reflect contingent institutional conditions rather than inherent defects of public participation. Third, it argues that public anger toward wrongdoing can possess normative significance, functioning as a form of moral judgment rather than mere pathology. The article concludes by advancing an affirmative normative claim: insulating penal law from public influence can actively sustain injustice by suppressing morally salient forms of public judgment and responsibility. Rather than treating punishment as a domain that must be shielded from democracy, the article calls for greater attention to institutional designs that refine, channel, and structure public participation in penal policymaking.

Alabama and related Eighth Amendment cases governing juvenile life without parole (LWOP). While recent doctrine rests on the claim that adolescents are categorically less culpable than adults due to developmental immaturity, the article argues that this foundation is philosophically unstable and normatively incomplete. Appeals to developmental psychology, neuroscience, and age-based generalizations, the article shows, conflate empirical description with contested political and moral judgments about responsibility, punishment, and citizenship. Drawing on political theory, philosophy of law, and socio-legal scholarship, the article identifies two central weaknesses in the developmental framework. First, developmental arguments rely on empirically fragile assumptions about maturity, culpability, and the coherence of age categories, raising problems for proportional punishment and legal consistency. Second, they obscure the political status of children by treating childhood as a natural fact rather than a normative and institutional condition produced by democratic choices about participation, dependency, and exclusion. As an alternative, the article reframes juvenile punishment through the lens of democratic legitimacy and fiduciary obligation. It argues that special treatment for children in the criminal law is best justified not by developmental science alone, but by the polity’s decision to deny children a full schedule of democratic rights while subjecting them to legal authority. To punish children as adults, on this view, is to reap the benefits of paternalism without bearing its accompanying political, social, and moral costs.

Drawing on extensive archival materials produced by civilian observers, incarcerated participants, and correctional staff, the article reconstructs how inmate participation, collective deliberation, and self-rule operated inside a maximum-security prison. The article contrasts two competing interpretive frameworks. The dominant liberal account of punishment treats inmate participation as evidence of administrative breakdown or failed prison management, reinforcing the view that incarcerated people fall outside the democratic demos. Against this view, the article recovers a radical account that understands inmate self-governance as an instance of participatory democracy under conditions of custody. During the Walpole episode, prisoners elected representatives, managed labor and resources, resolved disputes, and enforced norms of order, challenging assumptions that democratic practices are incompatible with penal institutions. By situating the Walpole experiment within broader debates on democracy and punishment, penal legitimacy, and the political consequences of incarceration, the article argues that inmate participation cannot be reduced to either disorder or managerial improvisation.

Drawing on harmonised data from the European Social Survey and International Social Survey Programme, the analysis employs Linear Probability Models and Diagonal Reference Models to disentangle the distinct effects of class origin, class destination, and mobility experience on support for redistributive policies. The findings reveal that, while individuals from less advantaged backgrounds and those in disadvantaged positions express stronger support for redistribution, intergenerational mobility introduces important asymmetries. Upwardly mobile individuals align with the less supportive preferences characteristic of their destination class, though traces of their working-class origins remain evident through higher support levels than the immobile salariat. Conversely, downwardly mobile individuals align more closely with the stronger support for redistribution of their new social groups, likely driven by exposure to economic insecurity and material interests. Crucially, these patterns stem not from mobility per se, but from the specific social contexts individuals encounter over the life course. The methodological contribution lies in applying Diagonal Reference Models to isolate mobility effects that standard linear models conflate. Given Italy's rising levels of downward mobility, these dynamics may contribute to broader shifts in the class basis of redistributive support, potentially reshaping welfare debates in a country marked by persistent inequalities and limited upward mobility opportunities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gahrb_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/gahrb_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.027010202698546815}, {"title": "Split Sibling Correlations Aren’t What You Think: The Hidden Mean Differences", "authors": "Martin Hällsten", "abstract": "Research on social mobility has increasingly emphasized heterogeneity in mobility experiences.

This article presents an integrative theoretical framework for the spiritual mindset, conceptualized as a dynamic psychological orientation characterized by meaning-making, self–transcendence, epistemic openness, and significance regulation. Drawing on research from psychology of religion and spirituality, motivational psychology, cognitive science, and clinical theory, the framework synthesizes prior findings into a coherent model that accounts for both adaptive and maladaptive expressions of spirituality. The model clarifies boundary conditions between spirituality and religiosity, delineates mechanisms through which spiritual orientations influence cognition and behavior, and identifies pathways through which spiritual meaning-making may contribute to psychological growth or vulnerability.

This study investigates longitudinal academic trajectories among public high schools in Georgia across 17 years (2004-2020), spanning the Great Recession (GR), using group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) to identify patterns in ACT performance and college scholarship eligibility. We also estimated the joint evolution of these outcomes. Differences in trajectory shape indicated academic pathways diverged in heterogeneous ways during the GR era, rather than exhibiting a uniform response across schools and communities. These distinct sets of trajectories were strongly patterned by socioeconomic and racial school and neighborhood composition—with schools serving higher-income and majority-White populations more likely to sustain higher academic achievement and access to merit-based aid, while schools serving more economically disadvantaged and racially minoritized populations were more likely to experience persistently lower or declining trajectories. Dual-trajectory analyses further show strong conditional associations between academic performance and scholarship eligibility, such that schools with more favorable achievement trajectories also had substantially higher probabilities of sustained access to merit-based financial aid. These findings indicate that long-run academic trajectories are patterned by existing social and institutional inequalities, with disparities remaining evident during periods of macro socioeconomic disruption. By highlighting heterogeneity in schools’ academic pathways before, during, and after a major economic downturn, this study underscores the importance of approaches that capture such heterogeneity for appropriate educational equity and community health planning.

Contemporary digital environments increasingly mediate these processes through algorithmically curated information streams optimized for engagement rather than epistemic coherence (Praiser, 2011; Gillespie, 2018; Zuboff, 2019). This paper argues that such environments function as psychological ecologies that systematically destabilize epistemic conditions while amplifying motivational and affective pressures toward belief rigidity. Within these ecologies, epistemic destabilization is converted to motivational urgency, and rigid belief adoption functions as a regulatory solution rather than as an epistemic failure. Drawing on cognitive psychology, moral psychology, and clinical science, the paper advances an amplification model in which chronic uncertainty, narrative saturation, moral salience, and algorithmic reinforcement interact with individual differences in curiosity, intolerance of uncertainty, and identity stability (Kruglanski, 2004; Carleton, 2016; Baird et al., 2012). Under such conditions, belief adoption serves a regulatory function by restoring coherence, significance, and moral orientation, even when epistemic accuracy is compromised. Algorithmic reinforcement dynamics such as repetition, attentional salience, processing fluency, and identity affirming feedback further consolidate these beliefs, increasing resistance to correction and revision (Hasher et al., 1977; Dechene et al., 2010; Pennycook &amp; Rand, 2019). The framework calls on Significance Quest Theory to explain why epistemic destabilization becomes motivationally urgent for some individuals, highlighting how algorithmic environments can both generate significance threat and supply readily available restoration pathways grounded in moralization, oppositional identity, and narrative certainty (Haidt, 2001; Kruglanski et al., 2014, 2022). These pathways may provide a subjective sense of autonomy while simultaneously constraining reflective agency, creating self reinforcing regulatory loops. Importantly, this work does not claim that digital environments directly cause psychopathology. Instead, it adopts an amplification perspective in which algorithmic contexts intensify latent vulnerabilities ranging from normative cognitive biases to belief rigidity and subclinical disturbance (Bentall et al., 2001; Vorontsova et al., 2013). By conceptualizing algorithmic media as psychological ecologies, this paper offers a unifying theoretical account linking digital reinforcement structures to belief rigidity, identity fixation, and epistemic closure. The framework delineates scope conditions, specifies underlying psychological mechanisms, and generates testable claims, providing a coherent basis for future empirical research and clinically informed preventative reflection.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4fcmj_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/4fcmj_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006292445976447514}, {"title": "Metadata for digital behavioral data: the case of Web Tracking and Social Media data", "authors": "Kokila Jamwal, Wolfgang Zenk-Möltgen", "abstract": "Metadata plays a crucial role to make research data easily findable and reusable in the future.

DBD includes all behavioral information traces produced through individuals' interactions, activities, and engagements within the digital environment.

However, empirical evidence remains ambiguous, and longitudinal research is scarce. This study addresses this gap by investigating how topic diversity in the Swiss press developed between 1998 and 2024. Using BERTopic topic modeling to identify topics inductively in 1,635,589 articles from three major Swiss newspapers, we find considerable changes.

Drawing on cross-national longitudinal data covering 161 countries, we estimate six linear panel regressions with country fixed effects and robust standard errors clustered by country on a multiply imputed dataset that ensures the inclusion of developing states in the analysis. We employ three distinct measures of militarisation and find that, contrary to prevailing assumptions, these do not correlate with crime or security threats. Instead, political stability emerges as the strongest predictor of levels of militarisation. These results challenge functionalist accounts of militarisation, suggesting that it may function, at least in part, as a political strategy—providing a veneer of stability, restoring public confidence in ruling parties’ ability to maintain control during crises, and reflecting a wider logic of control in which elites expand coercive capacity to deter dissent and project authority—rather than operating solely as a direct security measure.

An increasing number of people are engaging in online camming relationships, with some reporting that their interactions are not strictly sexual and involve some degree of intimacy. Yet, little is known about the factors that facilitate commitment between cam models and members. In a cross-sectional study of cam models (N = 199) and members (N = 544) from LiveJasmin, surveyed separately (i.e., not as matched dyads), we tested whether satisfaction, investment, and alternatives are associated with current commitment and future planned investment among cam models and members. Based on past research suggesting that alternatives are not as predictive of commitment in multi-partnered relationships and that camming interactions can feature intimacy, we test an alternative model that replaces the quality of alternatives with intimacy. Results suggest that, in most cases, when cam models or members on camming sites reported greater satisfaction, investment, and intimacy, they in turn, reported greater current commitment and intentions to invest in their relationship in the future, whereas the quality of alternatives was not a significant predictor.

Through analysis of legislation, judicial decisions, and policy design, the article demonstrates how submerged penal policies redistribute the costs and benefits of punishment, entrench private interests, and expand carceral capacity without the visibility typically associated with criminal justice policymaking. Because these instruments operate outside the most salient sites of democratic contestation, they weaken public understanding of how punishment is funded and governed, limiting citizens’ ability to evaluate, contest, or reform the carceral system. The article situates the submerged prison state within broader debates about privatization, administrative governance, and democratic legitimacy, arguing that indirect governance poses distinctive risks for public accountability in criminal justice.

Attributions to discrimination have often been conceptualized in terms of Signal Detection Theory (SDT), entailing speculation and theorizing about the mediation of observed effects on judgments through observers’ sensitivity (i.e., their ability to recognize discrimination) or response bias (i.e., their tendency to judge that it is present). Here, we take a first step toward moving beyond conceptual applications to empirical SDT analyses of attributions to discrimination. Across five studies examining judgments about gender discrimination in corporate pay raise decisions, we find that prototypes (Studies 1 to 3) and their alignment with the actual pattern of decisions (Studies 2 to 4) inform observers’ response bias, reflecting differences in their attribution of unfair outcomes to discrimination (Study 5). In contrast, the extent of harm caused by discriminatory outcomes exerts a small effects on sensitivity and a large effect on response bias (Studies 1 to 3), which reflects observers’ determination of a fair standard for decisions and not their attributions (Study 5). We generally find that response bias is more malleable than sensitivity — which is a theoretical advancement but poses challenges for training initiatives aimed at reducing discrimination through increasing awareness.

I discuss examples of such environmental conflicts in the UK and propose they can be understood as “trials of co-existence.\" Here, the introduction of new technological systems - such as autonomous vehicles - into everyday settings puts at stake the conditions of existence of other beings belonging to the setting, such as pedestrians or trees. The proliferation of such trials suggests that postnormality is not only marked by changing conditions of social existence - endemic disruption - but by distinctive struggles over co-existence, or interdependence. To conclude, I reflect on what such struggles can teach us about the political challenges facing our technology-intensive, ecologically challenged societies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xupgf_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/xupgf_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009469778161280695}, {"title": "Visualizing the Rise and Seasonality of Mass Shootings in the U.S.", "authors": "Tristan Bridges, Tara Leigh Tober, Sara Tyberg, Liz Munday", "abstract": "We visualize monthly mass shooting incidents in the United States from 2013 to 2022 by integrating data from five major databases, each employing different definitional boundaries.

The literature on public support indicates that this is often due to domestic distributive conflicts over short-term policy costs, especially for market-based policies. This study focuses on two regulation-based policy instruments (an obligation to retrofit building envelopes and a ban on new fossil-fuelled boilers) that target the same level of emissions reductions in the Swiss residential sector, but with different distributions of costs between tenants and homeowners. In a large-scale preregistered survey experiment (n= 1831), conducted in summer 2025, we inform respondents about the effectiveness of these policy instruments to assess public support. We experimentally manipulate whether distributive information (disaggregated by dwelling type (flat or house) and ownership type (owners or renters) is displayed and whether redistributive measures (policy exceptions or targeted subsidies) are included in the policy proposal. The results show that no redistributive measure can recover the drop in public support from providing the information on the policies' distributive effects. Notwithstanding, there is still a majority support for banning fossil-fuel boilers rather than retrofitting building envelopes. Additional subgroup analyses show that homeowners oppose the latter across all experimental conditions, including the control group. This indicates that homeowners are already aware of the costs for building envelope retrofits, before the experimental treatment can make policy costs salient through distributive information. As they are also unlikely to be more supportive when redistributive measures are implemented, a key obstacle persists.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bmcjy_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/bmcjy_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008578296380611361}, {"title": "Mapping The Socio-Demographic Diversity of Rural Denmark: A Data-Driven Micro-Area Classification", "authors": "Andreas Lindegaard Jakobsen, Anja Jørgensen", "abstract": "Rural areas are often portrayed as relatively socially homogeneous and understood through a unidimensional urban–rural continuum.

Using data from an online survey, we applied random forest models to identify key predictors of purchase intention, followed by decision tree analyses to uncover interpretable, nonlinear decision structures. Taste evaluation emerged as the primary predictor for plant-based meat; however, even among those with lower taste evaluations, purchase intention was elevated among individuals concerned with animal welfare and health. For cultured meat, perceptions of healthfulness and concern for animal welfare were important drivers, while in the United States, purity-based moral concerns acted as a barrier to purchase. Insect-based meat exhibited consistently low purchase intention in both countries, with favorable attitudes emerging only under specific conditions of perceptions and values.

Moreover, existing research has yet to address how the moral language and frames invoked by fans influence their prosocial behavior. In this study, we propose the social identity theory of moral effects (SIME), which posits that moral foundations play a critical mediating role between social identity and prosocial action. By constructing a four-wave panel dataset of 1,957 Chinese fans, we examine the influence of a broader form of social identity (i.e., national identity) and moral language on fandom philanthropy during public crises to address the theoretical question. We find that ingroup favoritism and individualizing moral language stimulate fandom donations, whereas outgroup hostility and binding moral foundations weaken them.

Using a synthetic cohort approach, we examine whether the 2022–2023 NSFG exhibits patterns suggestive of selection bias that extend beyond challenges to comparisons over time. We assess consistency across survey waves for demographic characteristics that should remain stable within cohorts and for lifetime measures that should only increase with age.

This study proposes a machine learning framework to predict echo chamber membership based on user features drawn from two representative platforms, Weibo and Twitter (X). We utilized a published dataset covering discussions on the Omicron variant and the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, incorporating 20 user features, including 15 general behavioral features and 5 Big Five personality traits.

Results revealed that strong emotional polarity, frequent social interaction, and high neuroticism were key user risk features associated with echo chamber participation across both platforms. The results matter because they move beyond traditional content or network-based explanations of echo chambers, shedding light on the individual level psychological and behavioral traits that make users more vulnerable to these environments.

This Article makes three contributions to the emerging jurisprudence of statistical evidence under California's Racial Justice Act. First, using hierarchical statistical methods applied to statewide administrative data, we provide the first systematic county-level analysis of racial disparities at the arrest-to-court transition, documenting that while the direction of these disparities is nearly universal, their magnitude varies by almost two orders of magnitude across the state—a \"county lottery\" in which geography predicts outcomes far more strongly for Black and Hispanic individuals than for white individuals. Second, we find effectively zero variation in disparities across District Attorneys within the same county, suggesting that racial gaps are structural features of local criminal justice systems rather than attributes of individual officeholders—a finding that counsels caution about reforms focused solely on electing different prosecutors.

Drawing on linked Dutch administrative data (2010–2019), we use multichannel sequence analysis to identify distinct “childcare strategies” across the first four years of children’s lives, capturing monthly trajectories of formal childcare use and parental employment.

The results reveal wide variation in the stability, intensity, and timing of formal childcare use, closely intertwined with maternal employment patterns. Children from lower-SES households are more likely to experience complex, fragmented, and fragile childcare trajectories—characterized by delayed entry, irregular usage, and lower alignment with stable employment—confirming and extending findings from prior qualitative research.

Background: Recent research suggests that, in post-industrial societies, paternal involvement in family life is increasing. Although previous studies of paternal involvement have considered paternal influences on children’s cognitive or socio-emotional development, such studies have not yet addressed paternal influences on children’s attitudes toward gender. Relatedly, previous studies on the intergenerational transmission of gender attitudes have analyzed maternal influences, but have neglected the significance of paternal influences. This study engages both strands of the research by analyzing the effects of paternal behaviors on children’s attitudes toward gender roles. Method: Multivariate linear regressions models were estimated on data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC); a survey with biannual observations over 10 years for 2,796 children born between 1999-2000. Results: Fathers’ time spent on childcare during childhood was associated with gender-egalitarian attitudes in children by the age of 14 or 15. The most powerful predictor of children’s gender-role attitudes, however, was the amount of time fathers spent on housework during children’s adolescence, both absolute and relative to the amount of time mothers spent on housework. Fathers’ unpaid labor at home was as relevant for children’s gender-role attitudes as mothers’ paid labor in the workforce. These results held after controlling for maternal domestic behaviors and for the gender-role attitudes of both parents. Conclusion: Father involvement in childcare and housework during childhood and adolescence play an important role in shaping children’s gender-egalitarian attitudes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4ym6z_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/4ym6z_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.015376245604858285}, {"title": "Inclusive Welfare State Research: Longitudinal Work-Injury Policy Data in 188 Countries Since the Industrial Revolution", "authors": "Nate Breznau", "abstract": "This chapter introduces the Global Work-Injury Policy Database Longitudinal (gwip_long v1) tracking the development, coverage, and generosity of work-injury compensation laws in 188 countries since the Industrial Revolution.

In recent years, protest movements and movement-based parties have entered electoral politics across Western democracies, raising questions about whether such actors broaden access to political office for underrepresented groups. This paper explores these questions through a descriptive analysis of representatives elected for the Norwegian anti-road toll movement party Folkeaksjonen Nei til Mer Bompenger (FNB) in the 2019 local and regional elections. Drawing on an original survey of local and county councillors, the study examines the socio-demographic characteristics and prior political and civil society experience of FNB representatives, comparing them to representatives from established parties elected to the same assemblies. The findings indicate substantial continuity in recruitment patterns: FNB representatives were predominantly male, relatively old, comparatively well educated, and often politically experienced prior to their election. While some differences between parties are observable, these are modest in magnitude and do not suggest a fundamental departure from established patterns of political recruitment.

Its core premise — namely, that increasing the threat of coercion necessarily produces stronger deterrent effects and greater compliance — has, however, rarely been questioned. Challenging the assumption of perfect rationality implicit in the presumed linearity between ‘severity’ and compliance, critics argue that the threat of ‘maximum coercive power’ embedded in militarised interventions may fail to achieve its intended aims and instead generate backlash effects by eroding legitimacy and placing non-state actors in a ‘loss frame’, thereby increasing risk acceptance, incentives for violent retaliation, and organisational adaptation. By contrast, governance-enhancing, non-violent interventions are expected to situate actors in a ‘gains frame’, thereby reducing incentives for mobilisation. This article examines whether higher levels of militarisation are associated with reductions in terrorism, whether they are counterproductive, or whether governance-centred, non-violent interventions are more effective. Using cross-national data from 2011–2021 and employing Poisson pseudo–maximum likelihood models with country and year fixed effects and robust clustering, the study finds no evidence that militarisation deters terrorism, limited evidence of backlash, and strong evidence that governance-oriented interventions significantly reduce terrorist activity.

Using a randomized survey experiment among Norwegian national-level civil servants, we find that democratic backsliding increases opposition to government wishes, internal and external voice, and con-sideration of exit from the organization. Managerial signals moderate these effects: civil serv-ants are more inclined to voice concerns or consider exit when managers signal responsiveness to government wishes. In a conceptual replication and extension among US civil servants we likewise find a greater inclination to exit if the manager signals responsiveness to government wishes, but also that respondents here are less inclined to voice their concerns to the manager.

By reconstructing historical CPR trends and employing advanced statistical approaches—including generalized additive models (GAM) and logistic growth models—our analysis accounts for Pakistan’s significant demographic diversity and varying regional contexts. The findings reveal substantial disparities in contraceptive use across provinces and regions, with some areas demonstrating steady progress while others lag behind due to persistent socio-cultural, economic, and infrastructural barriers.

Patients expect quality interventions delivered by experts, managers implore more for less, while clinicians including physiotherapists strive for support for professional agency from employers. The increasing demand necessitates effective rehabilitation interventions essential to improve patient outcomes, yet marginalization and the worst forms of managerialism pose real threats to clinical excellence. Methods: In 2013, we introduced a physiotherapy rehabilitation team manifesto in response to a shift towards prioritizing transactional metrics over clinical development outputs, which we deemed a threat to the quality of care. The manifesto consisted of seven declarations to strengthen clinical governance We evaluated its impact by comparing standardized clinical output counts (e.g. abstracts, publications, grants) and Advanced Practice (AP) proxy measures as independent and dependent variables, respectively, between the pre-manifesto (2004-2013) and post-manifesto decades (2014-2023). Results: There was a significant increase in total clinical outputs in the decade post manifesto which included 101 peer-reviewed publications. AP proxy measures improved post manifesto, with significant proportional rises in post-graduate education enrollments (11(19%) pre-manifesto and 48(81%) post-manifesto), and publication first/last authorship by team members (5(45%) pre-manifesto and 61(76%) post manifesto), indicating evolving research and networking skills.

Reaching it off-time may diminish young adults’ well-being due to non-compliance with the normative ages defining the ‘right’ time to leave. Indeed, the concept of ‘failure to launch’ in the literature underscores the crucial role of home-leaving timing on well-being, yet empirical investigation into the causal link between transitioning off-time and subjective well-being remains limited. This study, therefore, investigates how off-time home leaving and returning home relate to life satisfaction. Using rich prospective panel data spanning over thirty years from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and Understanding Society (UKHLS), we employed fixed-effects regression models to esti-mate within-individual changes in life satisfaction associated with these residential moves. We also conducted an additional, exploratory analysis focusing on young adults who had not yet left home, examining changes in life satisfaction around objective and subjective social age thresholds. The main analyses yielded non-significant findings for both off-time home leaving and returning home. Crucial-ly, the exploratory analysis revealed a notable —yet modest— pattern for non-leavers: life satisfaction experiences a significant decline (0.17 points) in the years approaching and following the objective age threshold. These findings suggest the psychological cost of delayed independence is not driven by the residential move itself, but by the failure to meet internalised social timetables. We conclude that the pressure of age-graded norms is a more critical driver of young adult well-being than the event-timing of the transition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hsdy4_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/hsdy4_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01535975361156583}, {"title": "It must be very hard to publish null results", "authors": "Ryan Briggs, Jonathan\tMellon, Vincent Arel-Bundock", "abstract": "Publication practices in the social sciences act as a filter that favors statistically significant results over null findings.

First, quotas fail to eliminate root causes of discrimination; Second, attitudinal change requires longer time horizons than anticipated; and Third, implementation creates new political constituencies that render withdrawal costly. India's trajectory -- comprising women's mobilization, political upheaval, and expanding caste-based reservations -- culminated in the 1992 local quota laws.

Design: Comparative descriptive analysis of pregnancy and miscarriage data collected by four surveys following different methodological approaches including cohort, cross-sectional and household panel surveys. Setting: Great Britain Population or Sample: 29,426 pregnancies reported by 12,648 women in 1970 British Cohort Study (BCS70), Next Steps, Understanding Society (UKHLS), and the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal-3). Methods: We compared the formulation of pregnancy and miscarriage questions across the surveys, as well as several miscarriage and pregnancy prevalence indicators to understand which approaches may lead to improved miscarriage reporting. Main Outcome Measures: Using self-reported information on past pregnancies from each survey, we examined the average number of reported pregnancies, the proportion of women reporting one or more miscarriage(s), the distribution of all pregnancy outcomes and more specifically the proportion of miscarriages among all pregnancies, and the age-specific miscarriage prevalence. Results: The share of miscarriages among all reported pregnancies ranged between 14 and 21%, and between 18 and 24% of all women reported at least one miscarriage. While the prevalence of miscarriage rates was similar across surveys, UKHLS systematically reported the lowest prevalence, while Next Steps recorded the highest. The prevalence of miscarriage substantially increased after age 34 in all surveys, however with disparities across surveys for pregnancies in the early 40s. Conclusions: Overall, GB surveys provide miscarriage estimates consistent with previous clinical studies but with some heterogeneity across surveys. These differences can be attributed to incomplete collection of pregnancy histories and variation in the age and cohort composition of study populations. Researchers should pay careful attention to questionnaire design, and possible recall issues when using survey data for miscarriage research.

Systems methods are frequently suggested as a way to provide an overview of the interactions that determine behaviours or actions and may help to understand how or why interventions might (or might not) change health. However, there are few examples of how these methods have been used in empirical evaluations of public health interventions. Methods: We describe our application of a qualitative complex systems approach to evaluate a population health intervention: traffic restriction schemes, often referred to as School Streets, where motor vehicle access outside schools is restricted at pick-up and drop-off times. We intended to use systems methods across our evaluation; here we describe how we use these methods to build theory. Following the five-step approach outlined by Alvarado et al., (2023), we produced research propositions, systems archetypes and a causal loop diagram to understand the underlying system in which traffic restriction schemes are implemented and their potential impact on school-based active travel. Results: In bringing together diverse and multi-disciplinary evidence from different stakeholders we identified unanticipated systems interactions such as increased initial tensions and conflicts between users of different active travel modes (e.g. cyclists vs pedestrians). Using causal loop diagrams and systems archetypes, we developed research propositions focused on funding and implementation, safety, habit formation and the potential for unintended consequences. Conclusions: Taking a complex systems approach has deepened our understanding of how traffic restriction schemes interact with their broader context and helped us develop a guiding theoretical framework for our ongoing evaluation. We intend this work to stimulate discussion, offer insights for future evaluations of population-level health interventions, and encourage public health researchers to adopt systems methods in their own evaluations.

Using event descriptions, registration data, pricing information, and post-event participant comments published on a dominant German online platform, the analysis shifts attention from individual motivations to recurrent organizational configurations through which sexual practices are enabled. The dataset comprises 137 publicly advertised events conducted on three comparable Saturdays in late summer and fall 2025, enabling comparison with a prior 2023 sample. Quantitative analyses show that admission pricing, including gender-differentiated prices and age-related discounts, has no measurable effect on participant composition. Multivariate analyses identified four largely independent structural dimensions—demographic composition, participation structure, pricing relations by gender, and absolute pricing—and a three-cluster typology distinguishing large party-oriented events, couple-centered standard formats, and niche events with a large surplus of men. No evidence of a stable participant cohort across years is found. Qualitative analyses of event descriptions and participant comments indicate that sexuality is treated as a situational and pragmatic practice. Evaluations of events in the participants’ comments focus primarily on organizational coherence, spatial layout, music, catering, and staff performance. Sexual encounters are mentioned selectively, mainly where organizers explicitly curate sexual practices as part of the event design.

Schemes to restrict private motor vehicles are increasingly being implemented around schools to address these issues, but evidence on how they might work to impact the school journey across different contexts is limited. Aims and Objectives: To explore the mechanisms through which schemes might influence school travel behaviour and how the impacts vary across different contexts. Methods In-person walk-along and online interviews were conducted with 24 families, five teachers and four local authority representatives across three regions (Perth and Kinross, Haringey and Sheffield) across the United Kingdom between September 2024 and April 2025. Ethnographic observations were also carried out. Transcripts were analysed drawing on Braun and Clarke’s reflexive thematic analysis, guided by realist evaluation principles and ethnographic observations to identify contexts, mechanisms and outcomes using NVivo. Results: Common context-mechanism-outcome (CMO) configurations were identified reflecting congruent narratives across participants. For example, In contexts where families previously relied on driving for the school journey (Context), increased inconvenience functioned as a mechanism (Mechanism), encouraging a shift towards hybrid journeys and or a full shift to active travel (Outcome). CMOs were broadly captured by two themes: i) considering change and adapting routines: how families responded to schemes, and ii) navigating challenges and building momentum: how schemes evolved in practice. Participants highlighted the potential for schemes to promote active travel to school, improving experiences of the journey and their health, while also noting unintended consequences such as displaced traffic, pushback from some community members and challenges for families with specific access needs. These experiences showed how supportive infrastructure, meaningful consultation and framing around children’s health and safety shape the impact and acceptability of the schemes. Conclusion: The capacity for schemes to promote healthier and more sustainable school travel, while also generating unintended consequences, suggests that effective implementation requires supportive infrastructure, sustained community engagement and alignment with broader policy priorities.

Understanding The Kinloss Over Life Course in India", "authors": "Amrit J John, Udaya Shankar Mishra, Ashton M. Verdery", "abstract": "Mortality shapes the human life course, yet its relational dimensions are underexplored. This Study examines the timing and likelihood of kin loss in India using data from the fifth Demographic and Health Survey, which records both current household members and reported deaths among former members. We developed new linkages to identify deceased kin and constructed non-parametric period life tables to estimate when individuals lose parents, spouses, and children across socioeconomic groups. Results show that parental loss occurs, on average, by age 33, with fathers dying earlier than mothers. Inequalities are marked: the poorest are twice as likely to lose a parent by age 25 and nearly three times more likely to experience a child’s death by age 65 than the richest. Gender differences are also substantial; by age 70, 36% of women are widowed compared with 9% of men. These findings demonstrate profound socioeconomic and gender disparities in relational mortality across the life course.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzk5w_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vzk5w_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0063355165618628195}, {"title": "Socioeconomic and Urban-Rural factors influencing BCG Vaccination coverage in Pakistan: Evidence from MICS6 (2017-2020)", "authors": "Ribal Ahmed", "abstract": "Despite Pakistan’s high tuberculosis burden, BCG vaccination coverage remains suboptimal (71.8%) with pronounced urban-rural disparities. This study analyses IPUMS-MICS6 data (2017-2020; n=17,872 children aged 0-24 months) using survey weighted logistic regression and average marginal effects to quantify the influence of child, maternal, educational and socioeconomic determinants on BCG receipt, stratified by urban and rural residence. Maternal higher education demonstrated the highest absolute association with vaccination probability (21.3 percentage-point increase), followed by strong wealth gradients in rural populations (up to 13.1pp increase). Pre-term birth was associated with substantially higher predicted uptake in urban settings (14.5pp increase), with no comparable effect in rural areas, indicating contextual heterogeneity in access pathways. These findings reveal structurally patterned inequalities in early life immunisation focused on BCG receipt, highlighting persistent barriers to equitable EPI coverage. Policy response should priorities integrated social protection and health system strategies with education-focused interventions and demand-side support for targeting rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged households.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g8de4_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/g8de4_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.06694058160350669}, {"title": "China is Not the New Rome: An Agent-Based Model Test of the Supply-Side Theory", "authors": "Ruiqian Li", "abstract": "Nationally representative surveys suggest Chinese Christian growth has plateaued at 2–5%, contrasting with supply-side predictions of 7–10% annual growth and an eventual Christian majority. Using an agent-based model, I formalize the theory's core mechanisms, including competitive evangelism, strict-church retention, cross-religion recruitment, and persecution-driven solidarity, under conditions more favorable to Christianity than any real religious market. Four findings emerge. First, the distribution of religious demand, not supply-side mechanisms, determines growth: under a neutral population, Christianity never exceeds 3%. Second, regulation always suppresses growth; the solidarity effect filters the church but does not grow it, consistent with historians' finding that Rome's Christian majority resulted from imperial patronage, not persecution. Third, strict churches win internal competition but cannot expand the convertible pool. Fourth, when declining intergenerational transmission is incorporated, the model's equilibrium falls to 4–5%, bracketing survey estimates. The debate over Chinese Christian numbers is not a data problem but a theoretical one: the theory's verbal predictions outrun what its own formalized logic can support.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t9f7u_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/t9f7u_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.025572684392463074}]
