The long‐standing literature on conditional cooperation has widely documented a knock‐on effect of freeriding.

First, I leverage a natural experiment in Slovakia, based on the timing of a naming‐and‐shaming tax policy. Communities exposed to a public disclosure of noncompliance donate 16% more. Second, I replicate this via a survey experiment, showing an increase in charitable giving of 9% as well as eroding faith in the tax system. Highlighting the role of altruism, donations increase the most among respondents who believe their town relies on public services. In a conjoint, treated respondents also preferred public donations, suggesting an additional reputation mechanism.

The analysis shows that constitutional replacements that result from negotiated agreements between representatives of distinct groups and constrain the executive’s ability to enact a state of emergency are associated with lower levels of ensuing government-perpetrated violence.

Pro-environmental governments reduce subsidies primarily when holding parliamentary majorities, while market-liberal preferences show positive associations with subsidies under minority governance. Critically, the combination of environmental and market-liberal commitments produces the strongest subsidy reductions—but only within majority governments. This three-way interaction suggests that ‘green’ coalitions require institutional leverage to overcome entrenched fossil fuel interests and phase out fossil fuel subsidies.

As CSD increases, legislators face Competing Principals Problems (CPP) between national leaders and subnational selectorates, weakening party cohesion. Yet this effect is non-linear: centralized selection fosters cohesion and centralization, while fully decentralized selection also reinforces centralization due to coordination failures.

Using a survey experiment and 50 in-depth interviews conducted in China, we find that exposure to revealing information about digital control slightly amplifies negative emotions but profoundly reduces positive emotions and significantly undermines public support for authoritarian digital governance. These effects are more pronounced in the context of digital surveillance than censorship and are most severe when individuals perceive control measures as personally targeted.

We investigate these questions through the lens of “bathroom laws” across two studies. In Study 1, we use functional neuroimaging to test three candidate cognitive mechanisms from the literature: (1) threat-related emotions (e.g., fear, disgust) supporting exclusionary preferences; (2) mentalizing (e.g., empathy, perspective-taking) supporting inclusionary preferences; and (3) self-regulation (e.g., aligning one’s behavior with one’s goals) supporting inclusionary preferences. Consistent with the intergroup conflict and prejudice literatures, we find evidence of a motivated self-regulation mechanism in bathroom law opponents. In Study 2, we investigate a possible source of this motivation using text analysis of open-ended policy preference justifications. We find that bathroom law opponents link their policy preference to a small number of specific values, particularly autonomy of action.

Further, experience with gun violence also interacted with political ideology such that the relationship between gun attitudes, policy preferences and political ideology was weaker among participants who reported experience with gun violence compared with participants that reported no experience.

To help protect against such democratic erosion, constitutional drafters and jurists sometimes restrict constitutional amendments by: (1) specifying in the constitutional text that certain clauses or principles can never be changed (“Eternity Clauses”); (2) granting apex courts the power to review the procedural validity of amendment processes (“Amendment Review”); or (3) developing judicial doctrines that block amendments that change the constitution’s nature (“Unamendability Doctrines”). But are unamendability rules actually associated with differences in countries’ levels of democracy? We argue that Eternity Clauses are likely to emerge in conditions more conducive to protecting democracy, while court-created doctrines will emerge in conditions when democracy is under threat. We also hypothesize that enforcement is difficult because when would-be autocrats command enough political power to amend their constitution, it is hard for both courts and political actors to resist. We test this argument using data on countries’ unamendability rules and their levels of democracy. Across three research designs—cross-country comparisons, panel regressions, and event studies—we find some evidence that countries that adopt Eternity Clauses subsequently have higher levels of democracy, but this may be due to differences in countries’ democratization trends prior to adopting them. In contrast, we find little evidence that Amendment Review or Unamendability Doctrines are associated with differences in democracy levels. We do find that unamendability rules are associated with higher levels of constitutional replacement, suggesting that when amendments are not possible, undemocratic reforms might be pursued by writing a constitution from scratch.

To measure each component, we draw on results from a lab experiment on incentivized voting where participants are exogenously assigned single-peaked preferences and answer comprehension questions on the rules employed. We find that most participants understand how to fill in the ballot with both voting rules. However, participants’ understanding of vote aggregation under majority judgment is lower and, crucially, more heterogeneous. While some participants correctly understand its aggregation property, a sizable group fails to grasp it. We also observe no difference in voting behavior between evaluative voting and majority judgment: the data confirm the theoretical prediction that under evaluative voting there will be a high incidence of strategic voting through the use of extreme grades, but contradict the prediction that under majority judgment voters will vote less strategically.

Knowledge items on commercial surveys often have guessing-encouraging features. Removing such features yields scales with greater reliability and higher criterion validity. More substantively, partisan gaps on scales without these “inflationary” features are roughly 40 percent smaller. Thus, contrary to some prior research, which finds that the upward bias is explained by the knowledgeable deliberately marking the wrong answer (partisan cheerleading), our data suggest that partisan gaps on commercial surveys in the United States are strongly upwardly biased by motivated guessing by the ignorant. Relatedly, we also find that partisans know less than what toplines of commercial polls suggest.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf044", "doi": "10.1093/poq/nfaf044", "journal_full": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007039524850135703}, {"title": "Toxicity and U.S. Senate candidate Twitter messaging in the 2022 election", "authors": "Jeffrey A.

While research into the consequences of social media use on politics and governance is mixed, elected officials and political candidates commonly use multiple social media channels to grow constituencies and draw attention to their agenda. A well-crafted social media strategy can further the perception of a candidate or elected official as credible, trustworthy, and able to effectively govern. However, research into social media has suggested that engagement is often driven by toxic and negative content, limiting the possibility of productive political discourse. Using a dataset of posts from 58 U.S. Senate candidates on Twitter, this study seeks to determine whether social media-based political communication during the 2022 election aligns with preexisting perceptions of toxicity. The results suggest that the toxicity of candidates’ Twitter-based political communication is mostly low, though temporal and group differences were found.

We extend this discussion by arguing that even individuals who are factually accurate may not necessarily be politically knowledgeable, as directional beliefs can sometimes coincide with correct information. We address this both theoretically—by integrating concepts of certainty and attitudes toward evidence—and empirically, by analyzing belief patterns across political issues using Swedish survey data ( N = 2,268).

Whole-network survey data from 200 employees in 31 teams in the U.S. and China reveal that, overall, knowledge hiding does not spread through communication networks.

Drawing on a transnational feminist perspective, it contributes to scholarship on postfeminism in non-Western contexts by exploring how postfeminist sensibilities uniquely manifest within China’s distinct socio-political and cultural environment. The study argues that contemporary Chinese postfeminist media simultaneously celebrate women’s autonomy, economic empowerment, and consumerist pleasure while subtly reinforcing traditional patriarchal values, particularly emphasizing marriage, family, and heterosexual norms. Despite promoting women’s individualism, the drama ultimately portrays marriage as essential to women’s fulfillment, illustrating how state-market complicity in China shapes gender narratives and obscures persistent structural inequalities under the guise of personal choice. The drama consistently attributes women’s successes or failures solely to their individual efforts, masking deeper systemic gender issues. Furthermore, the analysis demonstrates that Delicious Romance aligns closely with official state policies promoting traditional family values in response to declining marriage and birth rates. This alignment reveals how mediated narratives reinforce state-sanctioned gender norms and patriarchal expectations, highlighting the subtle yet powerful ways Chinese media sustains patriarchal structures, thus questioning the authenticity of apparent advances in women’s autonomy and equality.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251395995", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251395995", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014498809746732233}, {"title": "Performative Propaganda Engagement: How Celebrity Fans Engage with State Propaganda on Weibo", "authors": "Yingdan Lu", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2025.2584999", "doi": "10.1080/10584609.2025.2584999", "journal_full": "Political Communication", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0064172646524371935}, {"title": "“Twitter to Yell at Them, Facebook to Ask Questions and Instagram to Show Support?” Exploring Platform Effects in Responses to Women Politicians On Social Media", "authors": "Emily Harmer, Rosalynd Southern", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2025.2585498", "doi": "10.1080/10584609.2025.2585498", "journal_full": "Political Communication", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013945071098017126}, {"title": "Communicating About and Through Platform Values: Legitimizing Public Expression Regulation on X and Weibo 2007–2024", "authors": "Tianchan Mao, Chris Chao Su, Ngai Keung Chan, Lei Guo", "abstract": "In this article, we argue that social media platforms communicate their governance strategies both about and through values across diverse sites of communication— about values in presenting normative ideals and through values to justify their content moderation practices.

This study examines how such relationships are initiated, developed, and evaluated in Honor of Kings, China’s most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game. Based on 25 in-depth interviews with young players, it addresses four questions: the stages of romantic intimacy formation, enabling digital affordances, reasons for choosing games over dating or social apps, and evaluations of game-based romantic relationships. Findings reveal a four-stage process—encounter, acquaintance, development, and establishment or termination. Conceptualizing games as affective infrastructures, the study shows how platform design structures and commodifies digital intimacy while enabling embodied, performative commitment.

We argue that serfdom consolidated under the pressure of landholding military elites who gained political influence due to the prolonged struggle with steppe nomads. To contain nomadic raids, the Russian state erected defense lines on the southern frontier, and granted land in the area to soldiers in charge of its defense. The soldiers could not farm while on defense duty, nor could they compete in the market for peasant labor, as the land had been selected for its defensive rather than agricultural value. The system was therefore only sustainable by restricting labor mobility. In response to the volume of landholders’ collective petitions, the Russian state gradually tied peasants to the land and institutionalized serfdom in the written law. Using newly digitized population data from the 17th century, we show a higher prevalence of serfs and military landholders in districts on the defense line. We also find a higher prevalence of small estates – up to 25 serf households – sufficient to support a soldier and his family. Placebo tests show that these patterns do not hold for non-serf peasants, or for merchants and artisans. To ensure causality, we develop a novel algorithm that reconstructs the optimal invasion routes for nomads and pinpoints the optimal location of the defense line using topographic data. Our results highlight the primacy of political economy factors over purely economic ones, such as the land-labor ratio or the grain trade, in the development of serfdom.

Using Critical Discourse Analysis, we show that reformers’ alleged link between ius soli and irregular migration rests on evasive or diluted evidence rather than credible premises or causal account. By reframing ius soli as a conditional privilege instead of an automatic right, we find that both states reaffirm a sovereign logic of exclusion, reversing its historical role as a mechanism of inclusion.

Due to their everyday mediation of migrants’ care, resource access and rights, the providers are conceptualized here as a key element of the infrastructure of migrants’ urban citizenship. Theoretically this approach highlights not only the conditional, but always contingent, and thus, we argue, the infrastructured nature of citizenship. This article draws on interviews with providers and key municipal actors to identify three main spatial changes and their impacts: a shift away from communal urban spaces of care, an enhanced outreach and mobility of provision, and increased flexibility and novelty in shelter provision in the city. While all three provided opportunities for some extension of migrants’ urban citizenship, even if limited and fragmented, they did so to a different extent: The first two achieved such extension mostly through a provision of pandemic-time care, delivered primarily in parallel to (rather than through) an inclusion through the general welfare system. The last shift, on the other hand, furnished an opportunity to secure migrants’ rights in the city in the long run, since it provided a pathway to homeless migrants’ registration, and thus more secure status. These findings highlight the differential contributions of civil society actors’ specific approaches to their infrastructural work to the everyday making of migrant urban citizenship.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00506-3", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00506-3", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9912137231465442}, {"title": "Support factors in scientific mobility of Israeli female STEM researchers", "authors": "Zohar Barak, Nir Cohen", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00505-4", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00505-4", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08296032947350185}, {"title": "Mixed-citizenship couples’ emotional geographies of ‘doing family’", "authors": "Pihla Maria Siim, Eveliina Lyytinen", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00509-0", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00509-0", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.60151532910238}, {"title": "Sounding resistance: critical reflections on participatory sound-based research with racialized youth under surveillance", "authors": "Lamia Mellal", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2583435", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2583435", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.1114804870937618}, {"title": "Young people in museums: representation, anti-racism, and poetry as pedagogy", "authors": "Sadia Habib", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2583439", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2583439", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.2964064519389673}, {"title": "Getting race talk right?

Despite the increasing presence of immigrants in non-urban areas and political initiatives aimed at regionalization, research in Europe continues to exhibit a pronounced urban analytical bias. This paper examines the geographies of immigrant and refugee settlement along the urban–rural continuum in Sweden, Germany, and Switzerland. Using (multistate) event history models, we first examine changes in migration stocks in urban, suburban, and rural municipalities, emphasizing the role of immigrant subgroups in regional population changes. Second, we analyze internal origin–destination flux to enhance our understanding of the spatial adjustment processes of immigrants in the context of new immigrant destinations in Europe. Results suggest that immigrants contribute little to suburbanization and ruralization processes, with both initial settlement and secondary moves predominantly directed toward urban areas. EU and non-EU immigrants exhibit stable trajectories post-arrival; in contrast, refugees subjected to a dispersal policy tend to relocate in significant proportions to urban areas once mobility restrictions are lifted. In the three countries, secondary moves by refugees have resulted in an increased concentration of this population in urban areas, reaching proportions comparable to those of the non-European immigrant group not subjected to this policy. The consistency of this finding across the three countries raises significant questions regarding the effectiveness of the dispersal policy from a demographic perspective. Furthermore, transitions from urban to suburban or rural municipalities remain uncommon and do not demonstrate clear associations with the duration of residence or socioeconomic status, as predicted by the spatial assimilation model.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251394007", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251394007", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9967977105364856}, {"title": "Coyotaje in an uncertain social environment: prior coyote experience as a form of migration-specific human capital", "authors": "Kevin A.

We apply discrete‐time event history analysis to rich French administrative panel data covering the period 2012–2019. The results show distinct patterns of residential moves among migrant groups and generations. Immigrants from North Africa and Sub‐Saharan Africa are less likely to move to homeownership and more likely to move to social renting compared to the native French population. By contrast, immigrants from Southeast Asia, Turkey, and Europe have a similar likelihood of moving to homeownership as the native population. We find little differences in the probability of moving to homeownership across migrant generations; however, the second generation appears less residentially mobile than the immigrant generation. The descendants of immigrants from North Africa and Sub‐Saharan Africa are the least likely to move to homeownership and the most likely to move to social renting. This suggests that either structural barriers or cultural norms shape the mobility patterns of immigrants and their descendants in the same way. Finally, we observe similarities in the association between household characteristics and residential mobility for migrants, their descendants, and the native population. This suggests that life course events play a similar role in residential mobility across all population groups. For migrants and their descendants, those with low socioeconomic resources move less, suggesting that a lack of resources is a determinant of low mobility.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70163", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70163", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9906687757230679}, {"title": "Borders and the Spatial Diffusion of Family Changes: An Analysis of Non‐marital Births in the French‐Belgian Border Region (1968–2017)", "authors": "Doignon Yoann, Banerjee Adrita, Eggerickx Thierry, Ester L.

To understand these family changes in European and Western societies, numerous theories have emerged, accompanied by a wealth of empirical literature. However, the spatial dimension of family change is less studied than other aspects. Moreover, borders can play a role in the diffusion process by acting as barriers. Very few studies have examined the relationship between borders and the spatial diffusion of family changes. This article fills this gap by investigating the role of borders in the spatial diffusion of non‐marital births between Belgium and France. The border region between these countries is a key area for analysing these relationships. Using local vital statistics data, the study compares the barrier intensity of different borders (national and linguistic) by measuring the absolute difference in non‐marital birth rates. The results indicate a spatial diffusion in both countries, with borders acting as barriers. The intensity of this barrier role varies over time, peaking in the mid‐1990s. The national border is a stronger barrier than the language border, with the strongest barrier being the French‐Belgian border in Flanders. By showing how borders influence the pace and the extent of spatial diffusion of non‐marital births, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the spatial dynamics of demographic behaviour in Western Europe.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70147", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70147", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.39263491975220866}, {"title": "A String of Pearls: The Horizontally‐Networked Immigrant Enclave in NYC", "authors": "Bonnie H.

However, a number of more recent neighbourhood studies describe a host of new ethnic clusterings. These studies depict intensifying transnational ties in the immigrant neighbourhood at an unprecedented scale, however local relationships across these clusters have been difficult to analyse with ethnographic methods. I propose an update on our theoretical conception of ethnic enclaves to relate the proliferating body of enclave‐esque terms within the literature. Hence, this article begins to take stock of the field and revisit our foundational definition of enclaves to start to reintegrate and synthesise this data at a larger scale of analysis. Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau and Reference USA , I employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping to visualise how immigrant enclaves' commercial and residential elements empirically manifest on the city's contemporary physical landscape. New York City's Chinatowns are a meso‐level case study that exemplify my conception of a mutually‐constituting, interdependent, horizontally‐networked immigrant enclave . Findings show that some neighbourhoods like Flushing, Queens, retain characteristics of the classic, vertically‐integrated enclave, where residential and economic spheres spatially overlap; however, in Brooklyn (residential) and Manhattan (commercial), the 'hotspots' do not overlap. Rather than considering each cluster its own enclave, I propose a string of pearls metaphor that connects the flows (links) of co‐ethnics throughout multiple key places (nodes) within the city. Hence, I modify our commonly held spatial understanding of an enclave to reunify co‐ethnic clusters in metropolitan areas into a codependent micro‐economy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70156", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70156", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.993142069493708}, {"title": "What Drives the Settlement of Highly Educated Talents in China? A Social Integration Perspective", "authors": "Linyun Zhang, Sheng Wang, Jiamin Xu, Wei Li", "abstract": "In the current knowledge economy, regional strategies increasingly emphasize the attraction and retention of talent, making the settlement intentions of highly educated migrants a central concern for research and policymaking. While existing studies have largely examined explicit individual and regional factors, the influence of implicit dimensions, such as social integration, on long‐term settlement intentions remains insufficiently and systematically explored. To fill this gap, this study examines how social integration affects the settlement intentions of highly educated migrants in China. Drawing on 9202 highly educated respondents from the 2017 China Migrants Dynamic Survey, this study constructs a multidimensional index of social integration covering four dimensions: economic integration, social adaptation, behavioral adaptation, and identity recognition. It applies a binary logistic regression model, supplemented by endogeneity, robustness, and heterogeneity tests. The findings are fourfold. First, individual integration does not necessarily rise with regional economic development; in some developed advanced regions, high housing prices and living costs hinder integration. Second, regional factors such as economic development, geographic location, city size, and capital status are more strongly associated with settlement intentions than demographic characteristics or social integration. Third, among the dimensions of integration, identity recognition shows the most stable and salient association with settlement intentions, exceeding that of economic and social adaptation. Fourth, the relationship between integration and settlement intentions differs substantially across regions; in less developed areas, stronger economic integration is associated with greater mobility and lower local settlement intentions. Overall, this study deepens theoretical understanding of the relationship between social integration and settlement intentions, highlighting its contextual variations across regions. It identifies identity recognition as a core dimension and conceptualizes behavioral adaptation as a process variable.

Existing research has often approached this phenomenon either from a narrow economic perspective or with a predominant focus on prefectural cities and rural areas, thereby overlooking the significance of county‐level units, individual agency and translocal linkages. Adopting a translocal perspective and using county towns in the Yangzhou area of Jiangsu Province as a case study, this study finds that the return decision‐making of rural migrants is a dynamic social process constituted by the tripartite interaction of the ‘individual‐family‐place’. The study reveals that return decisions are not only based on a rational weighing of local characteristics and personal needs but are also deeply influenced by emotional bonds among family members, daily translocal communication and family authority. Furthermore, contingent life events often serve as critical junctures triggering the decision. The development of communication technologies and social media has intensified the frequency and quality of translocal interactions, facilitating family‐unit negotiations.

Migration theory has adopted aspirations and capability as two underpinning concepts for explaining migration. Drawing on empirical research these aspirations and capabilities are usually set within modernity and describe modernity as a driver , condition and/or result of migration. At the same time, another group of migration researchers aims to divest migration thinking from the shackles of modernity, pointing to the different entanglements of coloniality and migration, in terms of migration processes, the topics studied and the peopling of migration research. I call this the coloniality of migration , coloniality in migration and coloniality and migration respectively. These researchers argue for stepping away from modernity/coloniality, to decolonise migration research. Given the centrality of modernity to migration processes and theorisation, how do we decolonise migration theory? This paper deploys unruly modernity as a way of bringing these two perspectives together. Unruly suggests that as modernity and migration are linked, we should explore the inherent plurality of modernity through counter‐hegemonic, alternative and hybrid modernities to decolonise migration theory. Unruly also points to the disruptive ways in which modernity may be lived. It thus offers us the opportunity to disorder the coloniality‐modernity argument to reorder migration theory.

Here, leveraging a dataset comprising 447,438 animals hunted across 625 rural localities, we estimate an annual extraction of 0.57 Mt of undressed animal biomass across Amazonia, equivalent to 0.34 Mt of edible wild meat. Just 20 out of 174 taxa account for 72% of all animals hunted and 84% of the overall biomass extracted.

However, wild meat productivity is likely to have decreased by 67% in nearly 500,000 km² of highly deforested areas of Amazonia. Furthermore, the availability of wild meat per capita decreases significantly in areas with higher human population, greater proximity to cities, and more extensive deforestation.

For example, a genome-wide significant locus near PTPN1 (dog-directed aggression) overlapped with human measures of Intelligence, Educational attainment, and major depressive disorder. The gene ROMO1 was within a genome-wide significant locus for trainability in dogs and associated with intelligence, depression, irritability, and sensitivity/hurt feelings in humans. Other genes located at genome-wide significant loci associated with behavioral, psychiatric, temperamental, or cognitive traits in both species included PRDX1(dog-directed fear), VWA8 (touch sensitivity) , ITPR2, and ADGRL2/LPHN2 (trainability), and ADD2 (stranger-directed fear). From suggestive loci we also found cross-species associations for HUNK, and ZC3H12C, (dog-directed fear), SLC35F6 and IGSF11 (separation-related problems). These results suggest that shared genetic and molecular mechanisms underlie complex behavioral and temperamental states across species and may inform our understanding of emotional states driving undesirable behaviors in dogs.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2421757122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2421757122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015810451199735454}, {"title": "Rice farming for climate change adaptation in the Northeastern United States", "authors": "Chuan Liao, Jenny Kao-Kniffin, Matthew Reid, Wendong Zhang, Precious Tshabalala, Erik Andrus, Zachary Butler-Jones, Jordan LaPoint, Shuai Zhou, Radine Rafols, Seongmin Shin, Mai Ichihara, Autumn Pereira, Natalia Butler, Ying Tu, Susan R.

Recent research in cognitive neuroscience has proposed two contrasting computational algorithms for social learning: value shaping (VS) and decision biasing (DB). VS posits that others’ choices serve as “pseudo-rewards” that directly shape an observer’s valuations, leading them to prefer popular options even in the absence of outcome feedback. In contrast, DB confines the influence of social information to behavior—observers may imitate popular actions, but they update their valuations solely through personal experience. Although both algorithms facilitate individual adaptation under uncertainty, their interactive dynamics and group-level consequences remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we developed computational models of VS and DB within a reinforcement learning framework and conducted agent-based simulations to examine collective performance in uncertain and dynamically changing environments. The results reveal a trade-off: VS enables rapid convergence and high efficiency in stable contexts, whereas DB promotes greater adaptability under environmental volatility. These differences are amplified in larger groups, particularly under strong majority influence. Importantly, evolutionary analyses indicate that both learning types can coexist stably, allowing their complementary strengths to enhance group performance. Together, our findings provide a computational and evolutionary account of how social learning can both enhance and impair collective intelligence—and suggest design principles for fostering resilient collective decision systems in human and AI societies facing rapid change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2516827122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2516827122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006360492330781953}, {"title": "Migration and the persistence of violence", "authors": "Martin Vinæs Larsen, Gabriel S.

A similar pattern emerges for their perceptions of the most popular and central individuals, but we find no correlation between the ability to assess one’s own position and the ability to detect key network members.

They are nonetheless more accurate in estimating their centrality. Perceived centrality is only weakly correlated with actual centrality, but central individuals misperceive both their popularity and centrality to a greater extent. We further show that these misperceptions have real-world implications. Conditional on network positioning, students who see themselves as less popular and less central–and those with more accurate self-perceptions–tend to achieve higher grades, whereas individuals recognized by others as popular and central perform significantly better academically.

While existing research often assumes a uniformly positive impact of capacity, this study shows otherwise. In democracies, institutionalized responsiveness ensures that higher capacity consistently enhances provision, regardless of fragmentation. In authoritarian states, however, outcomes hinge on the degree of social fragmentation: where fragmentation is high, strong states provide more goods to mitigate conflict and maintain legitimacy; where society is cohesive, high capacity may instead be diverted to elite projects, exclusionary distribution, or control. Using panel data on 177 countries (1960–2015), I demonstrate that state capacity's effect is conditional, not absolute.

The prior “Legacy” generation is confronted by an “Emergent” generation with different understandings of sexuality/gender, intersectionality, and organizational strategies. These conflictual differences produce material and emotional consequences as the “Legacy” generation takes their resources away and members of both generations feel erased from the movement’s collective identity. Leaders navigate these “choppy waters” by taking either a harsh approach, which seeks to dismiss whichever generation is viewed as hindering their organization’s work, or an inclusive approach that views generational tension as an opportunity to grow and strengthen their organization and the larger movement. We highlight how the observed conflict between political generations prompts a serious re-evaluation of the “unity through diversity” mantra associated with this movement.

The theory of socially sanctioned reproduction (TSSR) emphasizes how childbearing and reproductive norms are shaped by individual and intersectional attributes of both evaluators and those evaluated, underscoring multidimensionality and intersectionality in childbearing norms. We empirically examine this theory through paired conjoint survey experiments with a population-based sample of women ages 18 to 34 in Pernambuco, Brazil—a highly unequal, multiracial context. In our novel application, respondents assessed profiles of hypothetical married women with randomly varying attributes and reported whether they were well-suited for childbearing. Findings show how intersectional attributes and in-group/out-group dynamics, principally along race and SES lines, define childbearing norms. Black women receive less approval if in low- versus high-SES positions, whereas White women receive similar levels of approval regardless of SES. We find that these discriminatory patterns are shaped by the social attributes of evaluators themselves, suggesting othering and group attachment processes.

Here, we gauge the influence of ethnoracial origins on life chances in the long run by studying trajectories of intergenerational educational mobility among immigrant and native families over three generations. Our study is set in France, a major country of immigration in Europe, where a national narrative of immigrant integration and equality across ethnic origins has long prevailed. We show substantial catching up in educational attainment and higher social fluidity in immigrant families, for whom the grandparental educational starting point was very low. The grandchildren of Southern European immigrants converge with natives in their mobility patterns, suggesting equal opportunities. Despite a partial convergence, the grandchildren of North African immigrants experience a distinct mobility regime and enduring educational disadvantage.

Aimed at recovering the costs of the opioid epidemic, this “affirmative litigation” was a novel action for most of them. Participation necessitated a tectonic shift in how they conceptualized their roles vis-à-vis the law. To understand how this occurred, we use a mixed-methods approach that draws on in-depth interviews and event-history analysis. Our investigation reveals the importance of “organizational scarring,” wherein an organization develops a lingering sense of having been wronged by another entity—a feeling that persists via an organizational narrative but does not shape organizational action until much later. Here, scarring resulted from the Big Tobacco lawsuits. As many localities perceived it, states’ distribution of settlement money unfairly disadvantaged them. This scar was activated when the possibility of opioid litigation arose, triggering distrust of state legal action and causing local government attorneys to reconceptualize affirmative litigation as befitting their roles—which facilitated their decisions to sue.

Our evidence shows that rising economic prosperity does not reduce the level of perceived conflict once income inequality is accounted for. In contrast, growing inequality is robustly associated with increased salience of perceived socioeconomic conflict. Findings indicate a sociotropic within effect of income inequality, net of changes in economic prosperity and accounting for contextual confounders and individual-level compositional effects. Our results further suggest that income inequality exacerbates class-based polarization in conflict perceptions: it increases perceived conflict across all groups—except the upper-middle class.

While previous research has explored how social class influences individual attitudes towards redistribution, less is known about how class-based network segregation—defined as the extent to which network ties belong to the same or similar social class of the individual—affects this relationship. At the national level, there is limited understanding of how income inequality could moderate how individuals at both ends of the class spectrum form redistributive attitudes within segregated networks. For example, in more segregated networks, the working class may experience heightened marginalization, while the service class may have reduced exposure to disadvantaged classes. This can deepen class-based attitudinal divides, particularly in societies with low to moderate inequality. However, in highly unequal societies, existing evidence suggests that the class gradient in redistributive preferences tends to narrow, primarily due to rising support for redistribution among the service class. This study investigates how income inequality moderates the interplay between social class and class-based network segregation in shaping redistributive preferences. Using cross-national data from 32,717 individuals across 31 countries, the findings reveal that homogeneous networks are associated with stronger redistributive support among the working class and weaker support among the service class. This relationship is mitigated in high-inequality contexts. Overall, the findings suggest that country-level inequality weakens the interaction between class-based network segregation and individual class position on redistributive attitudes, especially for the service class.

While contemporary structural-demographic models excel at forecasting the temporal onset of systemic crises, they remain largely silent on the consequential problem of prognosis: forecasting the specific morphology of the successor regime. This article addresses this predictive gap by proposing the Ideological Correspondence Hypothesis. Building upon the Anatomy of Chaos theoretical framework, we posit that the operational strategy of a regime is structurally determined by the epistemological architecture of its dominant ideology. We argue that regimes grounded in materialist-rationalist epistemologies instinctively prioritize Structural Resilience Engineering (SRI), creating systems that are institutionally robust yet brittle in the face of legitimacy deficits. Conversely, regimes grounded in irrationalist-mythic epistemologies prioritize Archetypal Mobilization (AAI), generating intense charismatic loyalty but structural vulnerability to elite fragmentation. Through a comparative analysis of paradigmatic historical cases—contrasting the survival of the Stalinist bureaucracy against the collapse of the Nazi charismatic state, and examining the internal epistemological shift from Maoist voluntarism to Dengist pragmatism—we demonstrate that a regime’s underlying theory of knowledge serves as a robust predictor of its strategic behavior and post-crisis trajectory. Finally, we extend this hypothesis to contemporary geopolitical analysis, offering falsifiable forecasts for the trajectories of current theocratic and neo-authoritarian regimes, suggesting that the study of ideology must move beyond descriptive sociology to become a central component of predictive political science.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cnkwv_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/cnkwv_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008723223970990457}, {"title": "Mapping Knowledge Networks for Climate Adaptation: Innovation and Exchange Among Local Authorities", "authors": "Pierre Van Wolleghem, Marta Bruno Soares, Ivan Puga-Gonzalez, LeRon Shults", "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, European local authorities (LAs) face growing pressure to adapt effectively.

By manipulating the partisan affiliations of perpetrators and targets, as well as provocation severity, we find that both Democrats and Republicans exhibit substantial and symmetrical partisan bias. This double standard is particularly pronounced among strong partisans, who are nearly three times more likely to justify violence against the opposition than violence targeting their own party.

We report two stylized facts: First, temperature forecasts are much more accurate in high-income countries compared to low-income countries. A seven-day-ahead forecast in a high-income country is, on average, more accurate than a one-day-ahead forecast in a low-income country. Second, while forecast accuracy has improved steadily since 1985, a persistent gap remains between high and low-income countries. These disparities result from both differences in the inherent scientific challenge of weather predictability across regions and from unequal weather observing infrastructure.

Drawing on systematized narrative review of literature from 2020 to 2025, combined with foundational complexity theory, two complementary models are constructed: an ascending pathway depicting how emerging contractors systematically build technical, organizational, and environmental capabilities to achieve global EPC leadership; and a descending pathway characterizing how established leaders experience capability erosion when organizational and environmental complexity management capabilities deteriorate faster than technical knowledge persists. The core theoretical contribution demonstrates that sustainable EPC competitive advantage increasingly derives from the ability to simultaneously manage high technical, organizational, and environmental complexity, rather than technical knowledge alone. This insight is operationalized through a Technical-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) complexity framework, mapping how capability phases correspond to distinct complexity profiles and identifying critical junctures where strategic intervention can alter trajectory. The framework is applied diagnostically to the German Large Industrial Plant Manufacturing Industry (GLIPMI), identifying distinct subsectors in different phases of capability erosion and specifying sector-specific vulnerabilities and intervention points. Eight testable propositions are formulated connecting complexity management capabilities to competitive outcomes. The paper provides both theoretical grounding for capability-based competition in EPC markets and practical implications for firms, industry associations, and policymakers. However, it needs to be acknowledged that this framework represents theory-building rather than empirical validation; the propositions require future primary research to test causal mechanisms and boundary conditions.

It may affect the likelihood and timing of parenthood, yet its implications for fertility remain unclear. Methods Using Finnish population registers, we followed 759,430 individuals born in 1982–1993 to examine how ADHD is associated with the likelihood and timing of a first birth among young adults. ADHD diagnoses were identified from healthcare and prescription records. Discrete-time event-history models were estimated separately for women and men. Interaction analyses assessed whether a partner’s ADHD modified associations. Results In age- and cohort-adjusted models, ADHD was linked to lower odds of a first birth (men OR 0.92; women OR 0.90), but after adjusting for partnerships the association was reversed (men OR 1.07; women OR 1.09). At ages 18–23, ADHD was associated with a higher likelihood of having a first birth, whereas an opposite association was observed at ages at 24–30 and 31–38. Thus, ADHD was related to a higher likelihood of first birth at young ages and lower likelihood at older ages. Both partners having ADHD does not seem to intensify the association. Conclusions ADHD is associated with earlier entry into parenthood but a lower risk of first birth at later ages. The results highlight the importance of accounting for partnerships: before this adjustment, ADHD was negatively related to the likelihood of becoming a parent, whereas after adjusting for partnerships the association reversed. This underscores partnership formation as a key pathway and suggests that supporting stable unions may help mitigate ADHD-related disparities in first births.

Findings reveal that 13% of participants use pornography daily, demonstrating significant frequent engagement, while a majority also access it with varying less frequent patterns. Early exposure during adolescence is common, with 59% reporting first exposure before age 18. Smartphones (75%) and websites (74%) dominate access. Youth demonstrate divided moral perspectives, with 31% viewing pornography as morally wrong and an equal proportion (31%) considering it normal or acceptable.

A Bayesian multinomial–Dirichlet–Dirichlet model harmonizes age and sex profiles from the two sources, leveraging the Rogers–Castro framework to characterize migration age schedules and utilizing the conjugate nature of Dirichlet priors to ensure computational efficiency. We illustrate the framework using data on migrant populations in the United Kingdom for 2018 and 2019, based on the two sources: the Labour Force Survey and Facebook. The analysis identifies three distinct migrant groups with differing age and sex profiles: younger Western and Southern European migrants, slightly older Central and Eastern Europeans, and a predominantly older Irish migrant population. Facebook data enhances the coverage of younger migrants, who are often underrepresented in traditional surveys, while the LFS provides broader demographic context and helps benchmark the estimates to standard population definitions. The findings highlight the utility of integrating traditional and digital data sources to address gaps in migration statistics.

We found that adverse mortality in 2010–2019 and spikes in mortality in 2020–2021 resulted in a substantial increase in the number of individuals bereaved annually. Increases over time were especially large for individuals bereaved by sibling loss.

However, the increasing medicalization of childbirth raises the hypothesis that social and institutional schedules now exert a dominant influence. This study empirically examines the historical transition from “biological time” to “social time” by analyzing hourly and day-of-week birth distributions among individuals born in Japan between 1960 and 1999. Using a dataset of 135,748 self-reported birth records collected from a commercial astrology web service, and after excluding default values indicating unknown times, the final analytical sample comprised 68,224 individuals. Birth trends were assessed using hour- and weekday-level aggregation, minute-level kernel density estimation, and cross-decade heatmap visualization. Results reveal a pronounced shift toward institutional scheduling. First, weekend births declined markedly, forming a clear weekend gap by the 1990s. Second, the natural dawn peak visible in the 1960s was replaced by a sharp weekday peak between 13:00 and 15:00 in the 1990s, coinciding with typical hospital operating hours; minute-level analysis confirmed that the drop at 12:00 reflects lunch-break scheduling rather than analytical artifact. Finally, heatmaps demonstrate increasing concentration of births within business hours (Mon–Fri, 09:00–17:00). These findings indicate that late-20th-century Japanese birth timing increasingly reflected the logistics of medical practice rather than intrinsic physiological patterns.

Despite a longstanding policy emphasis on ‘ageing in place’, structural conditions across England remain uneven, with rural and coastal communities often experiencing shrinking services, limited transport, digital exclusion, and fragile social infrastructures. Our updated umbrella review of 75 recent publications indicates that psychological, social, and hybrid interventions can reduce loneliness, but their impacts are inconsistent, often short-lived, and rarely examined across different geographical settings. We found no study adopted a genuinely place-based framework, leaving questions about how local environments shape both risk factors and intervention effectiveness. Insights from community engagement in London and coastal Lincolnshire further illustrate how place influences everyday experiences of ageing, highlighting shared challenges, such as fragmented services, digital barriers, and rising living costs. Whereas urban location-specific issues included isolation amid density, geographically close inequalities, and limited continuity of services, by contrast, people in coastal communities cited transport deprivation, seasonal and precarious economies and the erosion of community spaces.

We test this hypothesis using variance function regression models with sibling fixed effects on two U.S. datasets.

Within a “regime of functional objectivity,” institutions translate unruly hazards into standardized metrics that appear auditable, comparable, and decisive. That fiction works tolerably well because the uncertainties of most technologies can be bounded enough for regulation and coordination. The paper contends, however, that this regime has an epistemic boundary, past which the assumptions that support objectivity claims can no longer be safely ignored. Beyond this threshold lies a “regime of fractured objectivity,” where extreme stakes and sparse empirical feedback demand implausible certainty, small modeling choices dominate outcomes, and routine heuristics of expertise lose traction. The argument unfolds in four steps. First, it maps the civic epistemology that privileges technical consensus and procedural validation in technological risk, contrasting it with the plural, openly provisional treatment of economic risk. Second, it explains how this order is sustained by performances of objectivity that are methodologically valuable even if epistemologically fragile. Third, it draws on reactors to show how certain systems ‘fracture’ those performances by coupling catastrophic potential to hard limits on verification. Finally, it sketches the governance implications of operating beyond the boundary: cultivating varied expertise rather than a single authoritative voice, emphasizing resilience alongside risk calculation, and acknowledging that restraint may at times be the only responsible policy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9uzr_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/d9uzr_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004056575442090149}, {"title": "Souvenir des avenirs ratés de Faya-Largeau au Nord du Tchad : Entre utopie et perspective métropolitaine", "authors": "MAHAMAT HEMCHI Hassane, BASSENA Pierre, OURSINGBE PASSAL Joachim", "abstract": "Les villes sahariennes du Tchad, se trouvent aux croisements des pressions sociodémographiques et climatiques ; entre précarité urbaine et pression désertique à l’exemple de la ville oasis de Faya-Largeau.

Nevertheless, there has been a notable decline in linking processes within this region to contemporary developments in the rest of the continent. Here, there are early indicators of the Neolithic, besides evidence of the movement of cultigens and likely information about pottery manufacturing towards the other continent. Using a co-adaptive framework, I examine the social and ecological changes during the Archaic and Early Formative American Neotropics and adjacent regions, highlighting surprising networks that moved plants, goods and cultural systems during these periods. I focus mainly on the behaviors that link humans with their natural environments, beyond mere social changes occurring at the level of the producer. Finally, I present a Bayesian analysis of 161 radiocarbon dates from 39 sites in Costa Rica and Panama from the Late Archaic through the Middle Formative. These methods can identify anomalous dates and generate probability distributions regarding chronological questions about eight different material culture complexes: In Tilaran-Arenal, Fortuna* and Tronadora; in the Costa Rican Atlantic Watershed, La Montaña, in Gran Chiriquí, Talamanca*, Boquete* and Black Creek; and in Gran Coclé, the Preceramic B tradition and Monagrillo (archaic assemblages denoted with an asterisk*). I argue that there exists evidence for the early presence of ceramic from 4840-4144 BC cal, representing a correction to the established chronology of 1000-3000 years. Early ceramic complexes commonly interpreted as Formative coexisted with Archaic-period assemblages for hundreds, if not thousands of years before the abandonment of archaic-style complexes. Therefore, the presence of ceramics is not a sufficient marker of social processes commonly associated with the Formative. Resumen: El Sur de Centroamérica jugó un papel crucial en la transición al Neolítico y en la transmisión de la cultura neolítica entre Sudamérica y Mesoamérica. A pesar de ello, se ha disminuido la relación de procesos en esta región con el resto del continente.

Examinando los procesos sociales y ecológicos durante el Arcaico y Formativo temprano en el Neotrópico Americano y regiones aledañas desde una perspectiva co-adaptiva, destaco la sorprendente movilidad de plantas, bienes y sistemas culturales durante estos periodos.

Findings from a pre-registered discrete choice experiment conducted with 300 active German civil servants (Obs.=3,000) show that while efficiency gains and norms do have some impact, utilitarian considerations concerning AI’s ability to serve clients well are clearly the most important motivator. The findings show that the acceptability of delegating empathic engagement with citizens to AI can be tied to key dimensions of bureaucratic legitimacy, and provide novel evidence that the delegation of counselling to AI in PA is more strongly linked with public service motivation rather than self-serving efficiency gains.
