Some theorists appeal to border crossers\u2019 interest in free movement, envisioning an open borders utopia, while others emphasize the value of collective self\u2010determination, defending strong border control rights for states. Both perspectives focus on two primary interest\u2010holders: state collectives and individual border crossers. This analysis offers a novel perspective by arguing that cities\u2014and sub\u2010state collectives in general\u2014may also have significant interests in immigration policy. Through empirical examples like Europe's \u201cSolidarity Cities\u201d and North American sanctuary cities, the paper argues that cities often possess self\u2010determination\u2013based rights to protect an additional quota of vulnerable border crossers, beyond those their state protects. This conclusion is surprising because appeals to self\u2010determination typically defend a state's right to limit migration.

Because they are not observed, secret alliances by definition cannot achieve deterrence through signaling. So why do states enter into these secret agreements? We argue that alliances may also act as a signal of a state's intentions, potentially undermining deterrence. If a new alliance signals that the members' interests are unaligned with those of a shared enemy, the enemy may be provoked into war. As a consequence, states sometimes want to keep alliance agreements secret. To develop this argument, we analyze a formal model in which states may enter into secret or public alliance agreements.

Stable electoral competition requires trust in institutions, but trust often takes a long time to develop and is often lacking in post-conflict elections. We argue that UN peacebuilding operations can play an indispensable role in the development of stable electoral institutions through three interrelated ways: reducing political and electoral violence, supporting democratic attitudes and norms of peaceful coexistence, and reinforcing institutional capacity and the rule of law. Using a new measure of the expected quality of elections in post-conflict countries between 1946 and 2012, we show that UN peace missions are associated with better elections and a greater likelihood of successful transitions to electoral competition compared to post-conflict countries without UN involvement. We also find larger differences when the UN is involved in establishing electoral institutions, especially when there is no or limited prior electoral competition, indicating that the UN is effective at assisting the democratization processes in difficult contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251322287", "doi": "10.1177/00223433251322287", "journal_full": "Journal of Peace Research", "dist": 0.3587, "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "prob": 0.011473354530681323, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.011473354530681323}, {"title": "Nonviolent alternatives reduce external support for rebel groups: Evidence from two cross-national survey experiments", "authors": "Matthew Cebul, Jonathan Pinckney", "abstract": "How do nonviolent alternatives affect international support for violent rebel groups?

Nonviolent alternatives could plausibly increase support for armed rebellion by legitimizing the cause of resistance or reduce support by delegitimizing the means of violent rebellion relative to nonviolent alternatives. To examine this puzzle, we conducted two online survey experiments across more than 30 countries using a pre-post design to capture changes in attitudes toward a hypothetical violent rebel group before and after the emergence of an alternative resistance group. We randomly vary both the presence and features of the alternative group, including explicitly nonviolent rhetoric, government repression and concessions, and short descriptors meant to signal the alternative group\u2019s capacity to fill psychological needs for agency, justice, and belonging.

Further analysis using causal forest reveals that movement-related political identities are the primary moderators of cueing effects, outweighing traditional factors such as partisanship or ideology. Notably, while non-partisan cues influence attitude formation, only outgroup cues effectively shape preferences.

Finally, interviews and focus groups with Ivorian citizens support these findings, highlighting the sensitivity around PID. These results emphasize that in politically polarized environments, partisanship questions may be uniquely sensitive and impact data quality and the research experience in addition to holding ramifications for political behavior.

Even if these studies are well identified, the question of generalizability remains, as the studied attacks are often very idiosyncratic. In this paper, we explore the rally around the flag effect in an arguably difficult context: a sustained terrorist campaign held by domestic terrorist groups in a parliamentary democracy (Spain). To overcome the limitations of the single-attack studies, we use a multiple unexpected event approach: we developed a systematic process of matching the occurrence of terror attacks during the fieldwork of official public opinion surveys in Spain, through which we identified 142 valid attack-survey pairs. We find that in the attacked region support for the incumbent increases, on average, around 4 percentage points right after an attack, while support for the opposition decreases in a similar amount.

Blocking refers to constructing differences and social boundaries, whereas threading creates similarities, unity, and commonality.

In polarised pluralist systems like that of Spain, public broadcasters often face politicisation, and political attitudes are strong predictors of media exposure. In Spain \u2013 alongside the national public broadcasting service (RTVE) \u2013 several regional broadcasting systems were established by regional governments during the decentralisation of the 1980s to strengthen regional cultural identities and promote minority languages. However, the predictors driving the consumption of these regional broadcasts have remained unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by analysing the predictors of exposure to Basque public television (EiTB) over an 11-year period (2009\u20132020), drawing on four post-electoral studies and covering four Basque regional elections. Through logistic regression analysis, we examine how national identity, Basque nationalism, mother tongue and place of birth predict EiTB consumption, while controlling for variables such as age, sex, education level and ideological position on the left-right spectrum. The findings reveal that voting for Basque nationalist parties and feeling exclusively Basque are the key consistent predictors for EiTB consumption over time.

Under each objective, schools underutilize salary and performance pay while overutilizing retirement benefits. Restructuring compensation can significantly improve both teacher welfare and student achievement.

Despite the flourishing research on stereotypes about the Chinese in Spanish society, the actual perceived stereotypes of the latter and their influence on intergroup relations have not been adequately addressed. This paper provides insights from the perspective of Chinese in Spain, utilising 258 questionnaires to collect and analyse the common and representative stereotypes perceived by this diaspora. Through quantitative analysis, the paper evaluates the impact of these perceived stereotypes on the Chinese community's favorability towards Spaniards, their contact experiences, and their willingness to forge closer intergroup ties. The research uncovers a diverse spectrum of stereotypes perceived by the Chinese in Spain, which are organised into five distinct dimensions. The study finds that positive stereotype perceptions significantly enhance the Chinese community's favorability towards Spaniards, improve intergroup contact experiences, and intensify their aspiration to establish intimate relationships. However, when it comes to negative perceived stereotypes, the Chinese community demonstrates a notable level of understanding and tolerance, which only negatively impacts their intergroup contact experiences with Spaniards. This finding reveales the complexity of the perceived stereotypes by Chinese in Spain and their role in dynamic intergroup relationships, providing insights for further understanding this ethnic group and promoting their social integration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70051", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70051", "journal_full": "International Migration", "dist": 0.557, "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "prob": 0.9900519421510715, "pred": "immigration_topic", "score": 0.9900519421510715}, {"title": "Paths to Subjective Poverty Among Midlife and Older Russian\u2010Speaking Migrants: A Data Mining Approach Using the General Unary Hypotheses Automaton", "authors": "Lily Nosraty, Esko Turunen, Anne Kouvonen, Sirpa Wrede", "abstract": "In the Nordic countries, older migrants experience higher poverty rates compared with the majority population.

Drawing from the tension-centered approach, we posit that African migrants derived their remittance behavior in tensional ways based on the philosophy of Ubuntu, which is both enabling and constraining, stemming from the social context of the home and host countries. This occurs through ongoing negotiation with allegiance to Ubuntu from their home African country, their acculturation to the host country, and migrants scaling back from remitting due to ongoing experiences. In addition to examining migrant remittance behavior as a dynamic and contested negotiation, the sociocultural implications of such remittance behavior patterns are identified. We conclude by discussing some implications for future research on remittance behavior.

Bloem, Isabel Lambrecht, Kamiljon Akromov", "abstract": "In places with limited employment opportunities, households aspiring to increase their income are mainly left with two options: either (a) invest locally in their farm or non-farm enterprises, or (b) earn income elsewhere via migration. With survey data from 1,705 respondents from rural Tajikistan, we analyze the relationship between income aspirations and household investment strategies, and we contrast this to the relationship between income aspirations and international migration. We find evidence of a strong link between the income aspirations gap and international migration, but, strikingly, we do not observe any association between the income aspirations gap and local investment in farm or non-farm assets. These results suggest that households do not view local investment as a viable strategy for increasing income. Exploring heterogeneity, we find that these results can vary by household poverty status and household land endowments, but not by the respondent's gender. Given the prominence of migration in the study area, this also suggests that remittances commonly serve different purposes than farm or non-farm investments \u2014 such as supporting households in their day-to-day expenditures or funding major ritual events.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251343885", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251343885", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "dist": 0.5498, "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "prob": 0.9335749429642453, "pred": "immigration_topic", "score": 0.9335749429642453}, {"title": "Social Position and Migrant Networks in International Migration from Africa to Europe", "authors": "Sorana Toma, Mao-Mei Liu", "abstract": "Ample prior research shows that social capital is contingent on a person's position in society and is, consequently, a significant factor in perpetuating and amplifying social inequalities. In contrast, migration scholarship is relatively quiet about how social position may stratify the role of migrant networks, and instead conceptualizes migrant networks as broadening access to migration. This paper integrates theoretical insights from these two lines of research to offer a novel contribution on the interplay between social stratification and migrant networks. We examine three pathways\u2014network access, network mobilization, and network returns\u2014through which social position may shape migrant networks and, as such, reinforce inequalities in migration. To do so, we employ retrospective data from the multi-sited Migration between Africa and Europe survey that allows us to account for the dynamic nature of migrant networks and to distinguish among these pathways. Our study highlights significant stratification in access, mobilization, and returns to migrant networks among individuals in different social positions, operationalized as educational attainment. In a context of positive educational selectivity such as sub-Saharan African migration to Europe, access to migrant networks increases substantially with higher social position. And while lower-educated individuals rely more financially on migrant networks, which offer them larger relative gains, these networks ultimately exacerbate initial advantages and amplify social inequalities in migration opportunities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251343882", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251343882", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "dist": 0.579, "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "prob": 0.9951945999510432, "pred": "immigration_topic", "score": 0.9951945999510432}, {"title": "From students to refugees: students\u2019 (im)mobility in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine", "authors": "Ezenwa E.

Lee", "abstract": "In recent years, trust in US public health and science institutions has faced unprecedented declines, particularly among Republicans/conservatives. To what extent might institutional criticism on social media be responsible for such politically polarized declines in institutional trust? Two online survey experiments (total N = 6,800), using samples roughly reflective of the US adult population, examined the effects of key types of criticism against the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results suggest that just a single exposure to any of the key types of criticism was sufficient to undermine institutional trust. While an institutional rebuttal was partially able to reverse these effects, residual declines in trust were substantial enough to cause decreased intentions to adhere to the AHRQ/CDC health recommendation featured in the experiments. While institutions should, therefore, be concerned about all types of social media criticism, those featuring morally charged trust-undermining narratives attacking the integrity of the AHRQ/CDC generated dramatically more anger (i.e., moral outrage), which in turn attracted social media engagement preferences likely to promote viral spread and exacerbate preexisting institutional politicization and issue polarization.

A key question is how generative AI affects learning\u2014namely, how humans acquire new skills as they perform tasks. Learning is critical to long-term productivity, especially since generative AI is fallible and users must check its outputs. We study this question via a field experiment where we provide nearly a thousand high school math students with access to generative AI tutors. To understand the differential impact of tool design on learning, we deploy two generative AI tutors: one that mimics a standard ChatGPT interface (\u201cGPT Base\u201d) and one with prompts designed to safeguard learning (\u201cGPT Tutor\u201d). Consistent with prior work, our results show that having GPT-4 access while solving problems significantly improves performance (48% improvement in grades for GPT Base and 127% for GPT Tutor). However, we additionally find that when access is subsequently taken away, students actually perform worse than those who never had access (17% reduction in grades for GPT Base)\u2014i.e., unfettered access to GPT-4 can harm educational outcomes. These negative learning effects are largely mitigated by the safeguards in GPT Tutor.

In the village of Dizhengdang, the norm dictates that cofarming harvests should be divided equally among participating households. This contrasts with an alternative norm followed in some other Derung villages that holds that harvests should be divided equally among participating laborers. Rational choice theory and evolutionary models of norm-based cooperation assume that individuals weigh the material and social payoffs of different actions and follow norms because doing so maximizes their payoff. However, the behavior of the Derung in Dizhengdang is not consistent with payoff maximization. Using interviews on co-farming behaviors and attitudes, along with an ultimatum game experiment framed as co-farming harvest division, we found that most respondents preferred divisions based on labor contribution.

Central banks provide an interesting case because while they are self\u2010professed adherents to communicative transparency, individual case studies have documented their use of strategic silence as a defense mechanism against politicization. This paper provides a quantitative test of the theory that when faced with public contention on core monetary policy issues, central banks are likely to opt for strategic silence. We focus on the most contested of central bank policies: large\u2010scale asset purchase programs or \u201cquantitative easing\u201d (QE). We examine four topics associated with particularly contested side effects of QE: house prices, exchange rates, corporate debt, and climate change.

Using panel regression analysis on a dataset of more than 11,000 speeches by 18 central banks, we find that as a group, central banks conducting QE programs exhibited strategic silence on house prices, exchange rates, and climate change.

This study updates and expands those findings; the principal comparison is between MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. Methods: Findings are from Wave 3 of a nationally representative annual longitudinal survey of members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel, conducted May 23-June 14, 2024. All respondents to prior waves who remained in KnowledgePanel were invited to participate. Political party and MAGA affiliations were reported by respondents. Outcomes are expressed as weighted proportions and adjusted prevalence differences (aPDs; these are percentage point (pp) differences), with p-values adjusted for the false discovery rate and reported as q-values. Results: The completion rate was 88.4%; there were 8896 respondents. After weighting, half the sample was female (50.9%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 49.5%, 52.3%); the weighted mean (SD) age was 48.5 (24.9) years. MAGA Republicans were substantially more likely than non-MAGA non-Republicans to endorse violence to effect sociopolitical change generally and to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 21 specific political objectives (MAGA Republicans, 55.9% (95% CI 52.3%, 59.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 25.5% (95% CI 23.7%, 27.2%); aPD 30.1pp (95% CI 26.0pp, 34.2pp), q &lt; 0.001). They were not more willing to commit political violence. Similarly, while MAGA Republicans more frequently predicted that they would be armed in a future setting where they considered political violence to be justified (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 19.8% (95% CI 17.0%, 22.6%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 5.5% (95% CI 4.6%, 6.4%); aPD 16.4pp (95% CI 13.3pp, 19.5pp), q &lt; 0.001), they were not more likely to shoot someone (very or extremely likely: MAGA Republicans, 2.1% (95% CI 0.8%, 3.4%); non-MAGA non-Republicans, 1.6% (95% CI 1.0%, 2.1%); aPD 1.5pp (95% CI -0.1pp, 3.0pp), q = 0.43). Prevalences for other Republicans generally fell between those for MAGA Republicans and non-MAGA non-Republicans. On some political violence measures, prevalences were highest among a small, demographically distinct group of non-Republican MAGA supporters. In secondary analyses, MAGA Republicans endorsed statements of beliefs associated with political violence\u2014racism, hostile sexism, homonegativity, transphobia, xenophobia, and Islamophobia; support for the QAnon movement and Christian nationalism; conspiracism; trait aggression; and authoritarianism\u2014more frequently than did non-MAGA non-Republicans.

This focus paper begins by mapping the current landscape of disinformation policies within the European Union, including public and private regulatory approaches. While significant efforts have been made\u2014 particularly in targeting foreign information manipulation\u2014we argue that existing policy frameworks overlook important aspects of how disinformation works. Above all, there is a lack of attention to the issue of credibility: how individuals determine whether information is trustworthy and what role identity cues play in their assessments. To address this gap, we conducted a survey experiment to understand how young people evaluate the credibility of online content. The experiment involved 152 university students at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Respondents were sorted into different groups based on their self-identified gender and country of origin at the beginning of the survey. They were then asked to assess the credibility of a series of social media posts covering a range of topics. Finally, respondents were invited to reflect in writing on the reasons behind their evaluations, allowing us to compare quantitative trust ratings with qualitative reasoning. Our findings confirm that content quality remains the strongest predictor of perceived credibility. However, they also reveal that subtle identity cues\u2014such as a shared gender or national background between the respondent and the post\u2019s author\u2014exert a small but consistent influence on trust evaluations. These effects often occur below the level of conscious awareness, suggesting that social proximity and identity alignment can shape how people perceive truth, even when they believe they are evaluating content objectively. Notably, the results also challenge some common assumptions: posts from authors with Anglo-American names, often associated with epistemic authority, were not rated as more credible, and male-presenting sources were not favored over female-presenting ones. Taken together, our findings underline that perceived credibility of information is not a fixed quality but shaped by content, identity, and situational cues. Disinformation policies may therefore fall short if they do not account for these more subjective dynamics of trust.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xb4w3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/xb4w3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "dist": 0.5328, "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "prob": 0.0060463072463299294, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.0060463072463299294}, {"title": "The Anatomy of India\u2019s Industrial Interdependencies: 7-Digit Product-Level Supply-Use and Input-Output Tables from ASI Data (2016-2022) with a Case Study of the Mobile Phone Sector", "authors": "Sourish  Dutta", "abstract": "This paper outlines the construction of high-resolution, 7-digit product-level Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy, leveraging microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2022.

The analysis further uncovers substantial employment growth, albeit with an increasing reliance on contractual labour and a heartening rise in female participation in the workforce.

This process of re-enchantment acknowledges both the fundamentally dialectical nature of Weber's disenchantment and recognises that contemporary AI development has created systems whose operational logic exceeds human comprehension while remaining indispensable for achieving complex objectives. This paper therefore makes two theoretical contributions: first, it demonstrates that Weber's concept of rationalisation contains structural possibilities for re-enchantment that emerge through, rather than despite, formal rational processes; second, it argues that artificial intelligence represents the first empirical instantiation of this theoretical possibility, requiring us to reconceptualise the relationship between rationalisation and epistemic authority. 'Technological re-enchantment' here refers not to the return of pre-modern consciousness but to the emergence of structural epistemic dependence that operates through rational processes. Unlike traditional forms of authority based on tradition, charisma, or bureaucratic position, AI-mediated authority rests on demonstrated performance in contexts where explanatory understanding is structurally impossible. The concept will therefore be explored through three stages: first, examining the dialectical structure of Weber's disenchantment theory; second, analysing how AI's architecture creates unprecedented epistemic dependence; and finally, demonstrating how this represents re-enchantment through, rather than despite, rational processes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7snxh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/7snxh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "dist": 0.4034, "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "prob": 0.01834519206357821, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.01834519206357821}, {"title": "A new approach to teaching social class: Introducing the Edinburgh Open-Source Class Calculator", "authors": "Scott Oatley, Tod Van Gunten", "abstract": "This paper introduces a digital tool for teaching social class concepts in introductory sociology, social stratification and social theory courses.

Background: Grandparents are important providers of childcare for their children's families, but they may face competing caregiving demands within the family, especially as spousal caregivers. Limited resources may force them to prioritize one family member over another, particularly when new care needs emerge. Method: This study used eight waves (2004\u20132022) of data from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe, covering 19 countries. The sample included individuals aged 50+ who had participated in at least two study waves and had a grandchild under age 13 (56,383 observations from 18,754 respondents). Asymmetric fixed-effects regression was employed to examine whether starting or stopping spousal care was associated with changes in grandchild care frequency. Results: Starting intensive spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care frequency, similarly for grandfathers and grandmothers. The results also indicated a negative effect of stopping spousal care on childcare, particularly among grandfathers, although this finding was not statistically significant. Further inspection revealed that stopping spousal care was associated with reduced grandchild care only among grandfathers who no longer resided with their partner (e.g., due to institutionalization or death).

I argue that the Black maternal crisis is a continuation of racial logics that emerged in the epoch of American Slavery and persists in contemporary obstetrics in the form of medicalization. Established as a medical specialty in the 19th century, obstetrics and gynecology inherited the practices that marked the reproductive capacities of enslaved Black women as inherently different and justified experimentation and interventions that produced fatal outcomes for the mother and child. Black bioethics provides a framework for interrogating this history and engaging with the narratives of Black mothers as a basis for humanizing maternal care that has shown promising results in mitigating the Black maternal crisis. Drawing on interviews with researchers, professionals, and Black women, from the practicum experience, the paper outlines alternative models of care that are inspired by the narratives of resistance and proposes an education-based framework to address gaps in professional understandings.

Our results reveal that between 10% to 30% of Tunisians oppose the president but would not report this opposition on a direct question. We further employed a Bayesian parameterization of the randomized response design to decompose the sensitivity bias and model latent opposition and bias as a function of survey covariates. We find that ideological and policy disagreement with the president strongly predicts latent opposition, but that these same measures are negatively related to sensitivity bias. As a result, we show that respondents who are ideologically closer to the president--that is, the moderate opposition--tend to be more afraid of reporting their resistance to the regime than the more radical opposition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejbns_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ejbns_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "dist": 0.4987, "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "prob": 0.01921851385013118, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.01921851385013118}, {"title": "Financial Stress and Mental Health Among U.S. College Students: Gender Differences and Anxiety as a Mediator of Academic Disruption", "authors": "Tania Akter", "abstract": "This study examines gender differences in financial stress and anxiety among U.S. college students and evaluates whether financial stress predicts anxiety, and whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Data from the 2023\u20132024 Healthy Minds Study, a nationally representative survey of undergraduate, graduate, and professional students in the United States, were analyzed. Survey-weighted regression models were used to assess gender differences and the association between financial stress and anxiety. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) tested whether anxiety mediates the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption. Financial stress was modeled as a continuous predictor, anxiety as a continuous mediator, and academic disruption as an ordinal outcome. Female students reported significantly higher levels of financial stress and anxiety than male students, even after adjusting for age and race. Financial stress was positively associated with anxiety for both male and female students. This indicates a broad impact of financial pressure on emotional well-being. Anxiety subsequently predicted academic disruption. Mediation analysis revealed that anxiety significantly mediated the relationship between financial stress and academic disruption, and this explained more than half of the total effect. These findings highlight anxiety as a key psychological pathway through which financial stress affects academic functioning.

Given their extensive reach and attention to ecological topics, there has been growing interest in using commercial video games for conservation outreach. However, there has not yet been a holistic overview of work on this topic. We produced the first systematic map on how commercial video games engage with biodiversity and conservation. This includes 380 papers, covering five languages as well as both empirical (34.7%) and non-empirical (65.3%) literature. Our manuscript is complemented by a freely accessible and fully interactive online database. Users can further explore our findings and interrogate the available evidence according to their own interests. Overall, the field is even more diverse and multidisciplinary than expected: 450 different games have been studied, and a variety of ways to depict or engage with real-world ecology have been scrutinised. Ecocriticism dominates non-empirical work \u2013 often evaluating the extent that game design encourages or condemns exploitation of nature. Empirical papers are overwhelmingly non-experimental (93.7%); research has most often explored how video games represent real-world wildlife, influence players\u2019 ecological perceptions, or inform players\u2019 interactions with virtual nature. Despite the volume of literature, there are glaring omissions. Few studies employed pre/post-test assessments or even control groups, therefore making it difficult to infer the causal effects of video games. Most notably, there is not yet evidence on whether games make players more or less likely to take real-world pro-ecological action. Video games clearly have the potential to represent biodiversity and convey ecological messages \u2013 whether these be helpful or harmful for conservation. However, only by taking more rigorous approaches can we better understand the impact of games for this purpose. Our map highlights several promising areas for future study. As examples, we strongly recommend that researchers consider the role of player differences on the impact of games, observe actual behaviours and how these change after play, and pursue interdisciplinary collaborations with the games industry for more thorough, applicable, and novel findings.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f2qs7_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/f2qs7_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "dist": 0.3507, "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "prob": 0.010496605575033069, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.010496605575033069}, {"title": "Toward an Empirical Comparison of Bourdieu and Latour: Relational Theories in the Sociology of Poverty", "authors": "Floris Noordhoff", "abstract": "This article undertakes a comparative exploration of Pierre Bourdieu\u2019s field theory and Bruno Latour\u2019s actor-network theory (ANT) in the context of poverty research. Drawing on various empirical studies derived from a larger qualitative project\u2014based on 216 in-depth interviews with long-term poor households\u2014it examines how each framework accounts for capital conversion, constrained agency, and the reproduction of structural exclusion. Although both theorists promote relational and anti-essentialist perspectives, they differ markedly in ontological orientation and analytic focus. Bourdieu highlights the structuring effects of fields, habitus, and symbolic violence, while Latour centres on translation, mediation, and the generative power of heterogeneous networks. Through four thematic case studies\u2014debt, welfare bureaucracy, neighbourhood stigma, and the informal economy\u2014the analysis demonstrates that each framework reveals distinct yet complementary dimensions of poverty. Whereas Bourdieu offers powerful tools to explain the institutional reproduction of inequality, Latour draws attention to the situated agency of actors navigating complex material and social assemblages.

Yet, they also introduce complex implementation barriers and governance questions. The transformative claims of DeSci must be gauged against the benchmark of conventional science. Traditional research practice is anchored in methodological rigor through hypothesis-driven design, validated instrumentation, standard operating protocols, and independent peer review. Stable institutional arrangements such as universities, funding councils, and archival journals further buttress reliability by providing clear governance and normative oversight. Nevertheless, the contemporary academic reward economy, in which publication is highly valued, and grant income constitute the currency of promotion, often favors projects with near-certain, publishable outcomes. This frequently suppresses genuine curiosity, leaving potentially transformative inquiries chronically underexplored. The scientific community must therefore embrace decentralized, data-secure alternatives while preserving valuable institutional frameworks. Successful adoption of DeSci-AI hinges on interrelated technical, cultural, regulatory, and resource-related challenges.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP; waves 2017 and 2019), we compare the self-assessed relevance of eight different accumulation channels. Regression models (N=23,857) reveal that dependent employment is widely perceived as relevant for wealth accumulation across the wealth distribution, particularly for men. Individuals in higher wealth quartiles attribute a greater relevance to a broader range of accumulation channels. Women perceive marriage as more important for accumulating wealth, regardless of how wealthy they are. Women in the top wealth quartile perceive financial transfers as contributing more to their wealth than men do.

We distinguish between impact science, which often entails regulatory constraints on industrial activity, and production science, which supports technological and economic development. While prior research has largely centered on the U.S., European data reveal similar ideological patterns: left-leaning individuals exhibit greater trust in science overall, and particularly in impact science, while right-leaning individuals show greater trust in production science. These findings suggest that the politicization of science is domain-specific. We find evidence for both motivated reasoning and partisanship as drivers of science polarization. Education amplifies ideological differences in trust toward impact science, consistent with motivated reasoning, while closeness to a particular political party amplifies ideological differences in trust toward science in general and impact science, highlighting the role of partisanship. Exploratory path analysis indicates that partisanship exerts a greater influence than education.

This study aimed to add clarity by analysing violent crime data in Minneapolis. Methods: Interrupted time series on daily occurrences/counts of homicide, aggravated assault, domestic assault, sex offenses, detected gunfire, and 911 calls from 2019-2021 in Minneapolis. Models included logistic and quasi-Poisson regressions, adjusting for weekend, holidays, and maximum daily temperature. Results: Reported violent events did not increase during the pandemic, while incidence of sex offenses decreased 18% (95%CI: 0.71-0.93) and 911 calls by 3% (95%CI: 0.96-0.98). After Floyd\u2019s murder, homicide increased 137% (95%CI: 1.10-5.11), aggravated assaults by 43% (95%CI: 1.23-1.66), sex offenses by 35% (95%CI: 1.05-1.74), and gunfire by 108% (95%CI: 1.81-2.40), while 911 calls decreased 5% (95%CI: 0.92-0.97). Conclusions: Floyd\u2019s murder better explains the 2020 rise in violence. The immediate rise in gunfire after Floyd\u2019s murder suggests a change in the willingness to use firearms already in possession rather than a sudden influx of them, while the drop in 911 calls aligns with the theory that the causative mechanism was community members disengaging from police to address crime and resolved disputes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z6vy9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/z6vy9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "dist": 0.4405, "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "prob": 0.01625490065024282, "pred": "other_topic", "score": 0.01625490065024282}]
