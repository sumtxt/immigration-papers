[{"title":"Causal Panel Analysis under Parallel Trends: Lessons from a Large Reanalysis Study","authors":"ALBERT CHIU, XINGCHEN LAN, ZIYI LIU, YIQING XU","abstract":"Two-way fixed effects (TWFE) models are widely used in political science to establish causality, but recent methodological discussions highlight their limitations under heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) and violations of the parallel trends (PT) assumption. This growing literature has introduced numerous new estimators and procedures, causing confusion among researchers about the reliability of existing results and best practices. To address these concerns, we replicated and reanalyzed 49 studies from leading journals that employ TWFE models for causal inference using observational panel data with binary treatments. Using six HTE-robust estimators, diagnostic tests, and sensitivity analyses, we find: (i) HTE-robust estimators yield qualitatively similar but highly variable results; (ii) while a few studies show clear signs of PT violations, many lack evidence to support this assumption; and (iii) many studies are underpowered when accounting for HTE and potential PT violations. We emphasize the importance of strong research designs and rigorous validation of key identifying assumptions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425000243","doi":"10.1017/s0003055425000243","journal_full":"American Political Science Review","dist":0.5211,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Beyond Retraumatization: Trauma-Informed Political Science Research","authors":"Amanda Weiss","abstract":"Ethics guides for political science instruct researchers to avoid retraumatization of human subjects (for example, APSA 2022; Fujii 2012).

This paper clarifies what is at stake when we talk about research participant distress and provides recommendations for handling concerns about trauma and retraumatization. It offers a new framework for trauma-informed political science research. This framework reflects the conclusions of the empirical literature on the risk of distress in different research settings as well as critical normative perspectives on consequentialist research ethics. In particular, it identifies two approaches for trauma-informed political science research: one for research in less vulnerable contexts and one for research with contexts that are vulnerable in terms of limited resources, ongoing suffering, and/or geopolitical instability. The framework details best practices for informed consent, debriefing, and more within each approach. The paper also addresses the special challenges of political violence research. While the literature suggests that retraumatization as such is rarely a major risk of research, the paper highlights that a narrowly defined concept of retraumatization can lead us to neglect other trauma-informed concerns.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123424000620","doi":"10.1017/s0007123424000620","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4661,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Social Capital in North Korea: Shadow Economy, Shared Norms and Social Networks","authors":"Taehee Whang, Young Jun Choi, Wooseon Choi, Hyung-min Joo","abstract":"Since the collapse of the command economy in the 1990s, North Korea has experienced profound changes driven by bottom-up marketization. This paper examines the impact of informal marketization on “social capital” (defined as shared norms and social networks) in North Korea. Our study investigates whether and to what extent the shadow economy has influenced social capital in the region. We gathered data through a survey of 1309 defectors, interviews with approximately 100 defectors, and in-depth interviews with 24 former high-ranking North Korean officials. Both quantitative tests and qualitative analyses indicate a significant transformation of social capital in North Korea. The traditional “old” social capital, which was previously centered around official workplaces, has diminished. In its place, a “new” social capital has emerged, primarily revolving around marketplaces in recent years. The shadow economy has been instrumental in fostering this new type of social capital, influencing both the “bonding” (shared norms) and “bridging” (social networks) aspects. Despite the emergence of a new social capital facilitated by bottom-up marketization, its evolution into a civil society remains uncertain due to two critical limitations: a lack of both civic engagement and social autonomy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251349667","doi":"10.1177/00104140251349667","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.4455,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Charity Begins at Home: Domestic Political Economy of Chinese Foreign Aid","authors":"Sibo Liu, Dong Zhang","abstract":"How does an authoritarian donor’s domestic political economy shape its aid practices?

While Gamson’s Law suggests coalition participants receive ministries proportional to their parliamentary seats, both coalition formation theory and ministry allocation theory imply that radicalism weakens bargaining power. Additionally, empirical research links radical parties to prioritisation of policy payoffs. I propose a theoretical model distinguishing between types of radicalism, identifying distinct mechanisms leading to ministry undercompensation. My findings show that radical parties systematically receive fewer ministries, primarily due to reduced bargaining power rather than because of payoff preferences.

Programmatic transformation and delivering inclusive benefits require building infrastructural power and expanding state reach, while opportunistic use of power for exclusive, private gains does not necessitate non-coercive power.

The selectivity and flexibility inherent in FTA liberalization accommodate heterogeneity among firms in trade preferences, incentivizing them to lobby individually for specific FTA design configurations aligned with their particular production organizations. This article theorizes how the interaction between two variables—(1) inter-firm heterogeneity in production organization and (2) asymmetric liberalization through FTA design configurations—determines heterogeneity in FTA utilization among firms, favoring some over others within the trade area. These arguments are examined in the context of the Thai automotive industry and the FTAs signed by Thailand with other Southeast Asian countries, Japan, India, and Australia, drawing on interviews and administrative records. The empirical evidence supports the explanatory power of these variables in accounting for inter-firm heterogeneity in trade preferences, lobbying patterns, and FTA utilization. Automakers lobbied for FTA configurations that selectively liberalize their trade flows relative to competitors within the trade area, primarily using FTAs for hierarchical and captive cross-border input trade with subsidiaries and long-term suppliers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqaf038","doi":"10.1093/isq/sqaf038","journal_full":"International Studies Quarterly","dist":0.4247,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Individual Mobilization by Victims of Human Rights Abuse: Who Files Petitions in the United Nations?","authors":"Rachel J Schoner","abstract":"Who files petitions against repressive regimes in the United Nations?

These reputational costs, in turn, serve as a tying-hands signal that enhances the credibility of peaceful commitments. Nonetheless, empirical research on whether and under what conditions such reputation costs arise remains limited. To address this gap, this study conducts a preregistered survey experiment in the United States, using a hypothetical scenario involving military buildups by China and Japan. The results indicate that violating commitments to peace undermines the credibility of future commitments, particularly when the violator is a rival country.

The number of wars increased from nine to 11, the highest count since 2016. The UCDP recorded marginal declines in both state-based fatalities and organized violence as a whole. In contrast, one-sided violence saw a sharp increase, driven primarily by escalating attacks by Islamic State in Africa and widespread killings by non-state actors in Haiti. Non-state conflict declined, both in the number of active conflicts and in total fatalities. In total, the UCDP recorded almost 160,000 deaths in organized violence in 2024. The article also addresses challenges in the classification of casualties, highlighting how limitations in data quality and information access contribute to uncertainty around the civilian-to-combatant fatality ratio.

Relatedly, after wars, patriarchal backlash can close the space for women, limiting their newfound political access. This paper argues that despite the incentives to leave women behind, the political parties evolving out of rebel groups (‘rebel parties’) continue practices of women’s inclusion to capture the continued benefits of their representation after war. I argue that the legacies of women’s roles will have symbolic effects on the rebel party’s recruitment of women, women’s candidate emergence, and voter support for women. I present novel data on women’s representation in rebel parties from 1970 to 2020 and find that rebel parties run and elect more women post-conflict when rebels had women wartime participants. I show that these results are consistent across the types of roles that women held during conflict and over time.

On the face of it, one troubling consequence of this approach is that a community’s assessment of its own vital interests cannot be decisive. Yet as we explain, the critical issue is not who should be the arbiter of an interest but the need to be fair to the interests of all concerned. To illustrate how a public reason approach of this sort might be rendered sufficiently specific to be of practical use, we take human rights law as our example. Having considered a number of potential difficulties that this example throws up, we conclude by noting how a justificatory test can help to deliver not just greater political stability but a more democratically progressive form of politics.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725000647","doi":"10.1017/s1537592725000647","journal_full":"Perspectives on Politics","dist":0.4098,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Risky Business: Organizational Challenges in International Support for Civilian Self-Protection","authors":"Jennifer M. Welsh, Emily Paddon Rhoads, Juan Masullo","abstract":"Over the last decade, a range of international actors has moved away from direct forms of intervention to protect civilian populations in favor of “bottom-up” approaches that emphasize external support for civilian self-protection (CSP). While this indirect action is often perceived to be less costly, more legitimate, and potentially more effective, we argue that external support for CSP is a “risky business” that presents a significant dilemma for international governmental and nongovernmental organizations. Drawing on literature from sociology, economics, and civil war studies, we conceptualize and categorize the risks of unintended consequences that could accompany external support for CSP and suggest why they are likely to arise in this context. We then empirically explore whether and how these risks manifest with an in-depth study of four purposively selected organizations supporting CSP in their programming. We also assess whether and how organizational type matters for the prevalence of these consequences and how the risk of their occurrence is managed. Our analysis shows that, across a range of conflict settings, all four organizations encountered unintended consequences of three main kinds: increased vulnerability and insecurity for local communities, challenges to organizational mandates and values, and strained relations with key protection stakeholders. International actors supporting CSP thus confront the dilemma of seeking to enhance their effectiveness and legitimacy by “localizing” protection, but potentially create new challenges and perverse effects and/or compromise their organizational identity in the process. While this dilemma is inherent in all external protection assistance, our study highlights the importance of actor embeddedness: organizations that are more proximate to the communities they work with are in a better position to minimize these unintended consequences and manage the risks associated with supporting CSP. These findings contribute to ongoing debates about civilian protection in comparative politics, international relations, and humanitarian studies, but also offer concrete insights for practitioners engaged in support for CSP. More broadly, our study could have implications for other policy areas where the legitimacy of so-called top down approaches is being questioned and where these approaches are giving way to the empowerment of local actors and processes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725000519","doi":"10.1017/s1537592725000519","journal_full":"Perspectives on Politics","dist":0.4907,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Framing Labor Action: Experimental Evidence from Teachers in Mexico","authors":"Christopher Chambers-Ju, Mart Trasberg","abstract":"Labor organizations increasingly rely on political communication campaigns to win broader support from bystanders.

This sense of confidence, often referred to as political efficacy, is important since it boosts citizens’ engagement with political democracy. The literature on political efficacy shows sharp sociodemographic inequalities in how self-efficacious citizens feel regarding political processes. These differences are already manifesting before adolescents formally take part in political democracy. Yet, there is limited understanding of how these inequalities develop over time and what accounts for these inequalities. In this paper, we analyze panel data among Dutch adolescents during their formative years (ages 12 to 16). The results demonstrate that internal and external political efficacy develop differently during adolescence; while internal political efficacy constantly rises, external political efficacy fluctuates more. In addition, while stark inequalities in internal political efficacy are already visible at age 12, these inequalities are less prominent in external political efficacy. The existing inequalities in internal and external efficacy, however, are substantially diminished by the time adolescents are 16 years old. Furthermore, political conversations with parents and peers correspond with growth in internal political efficacy but do not play a role in external political efficacy. Finally, contrary to our expectations, discussions with teachers play no role in the development of both political efficacy types.

The Limitations of American Identity in Reducing Racial Conflict","authors":"Peter Luca Versteegen, Stylianos Syropoulos","abstract":"When diversification becomes salient, a sizable share of white Americans experiences status threat and reacts with backlash. In this paper, we argue that status threat arises because white Americans tend to perceive racial minorities as competing outgroups, not as fellow Americans. Building on recent research suggesting that shared American identity primes can reduce partisan conflict, we test whether reminders of a shared American identity may reduce status threat and thus mitigate subsequent backlash. Across four experiments (total N = 4,062), we replicate status threat as the key mechanism between diversification salience and backlash. Despite various American identity primes and accounting for confounding variables, however, we find little indication that a shared American identity could reduce racial (and, in exploratory analyses, partisan) conflict in America. We discuss the implications for future research and the practical use of a shared American identity when little remains that is shared.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10050-6","doi":"10.1007/s11109-025-10050-6","journal_full":"Political Behavior","dist":0.6271,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Effects of race and political identity on interpersonal cooperation: A secondary analysis and replication","authors":"Kevin J.

The overlap between political and racial identities in particular has been given much attention. The current report compares results from two cross‐categorization studies designed to (a) examine the relative weight of race and political identity in cooperative decision‐making and (b) to explore individual differences in pattern of response as a function of participant's own race and political ideology. Study 1 was a re‐analysis of data reported in an earlier research article by Ugular and colleagues (2023, Experiment 2) and Study 2 was a conceptual replication with some modifications. Results from both studies revealed significant interactions between participant identities and partner characteristics such that the relative effects of partner race and partner political ideology on cooperative behavior differed as a function of the combined racial (Black or White) and political (liberal or conservative) identity of the respondent. Similarities and differences in the pattern of results between the two studies are discussed in terms of their implications for our understanding of political polarization.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70047","doi":"10.1111/pops.70047","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.5813,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Measuring Gender in Comparative Survey Research","authors":"Oscar Castorena, Eli G.

First, we used regression analysis to decompose election results into the voting preferences of two voter groups: those who voted irrespective of any turnout shock and those who voted because they were affected by the shock. Second, we obtained an estimate of a fully representative counterfactual election result using the results of a survey.

We build on previous research that posits an inverted U-shaped relationship: Rising inequality initially boosts turnout but ultimately discourages participation. We extend this framework by examining how location influences this association. In low-inequality contexts, the combination of institutional support for mobilization and increased awareness of inequality’s effects in large cities may lead to a steeper rise in turnout compared to small towns. Conversely, small towns may experience a sharper decline in turnout at high inequality levels due to heightened feelings of marginalization and disenfranchisement. Employing a panel data set of Spanish municipalities and an interaction-based regression model, our findings support the inverted U-shaped relationship and the moderating effect of location. Urban areas exhibit a stronger initial positive association between inequality and turnout, while rural areas and smaller cities see a steeper decline at high inequality levels. These results underscore the importance of social and geographical context in understanding the link between inequality and political participation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01287-0","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01287-0","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.5317,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The mixed local-proportional electoral system: balancing political interests and common good","authors":"Jarosław Flis, Marek M.

Indeed, many states enacted “trigger” laws that would only carry the force of law if Roe were overturned. The Supreme Court in Dobbs vs. Jackson (2022) removed the constitutional right to abortion, ending a situation in which this type of position taking lacked policy consequences and creating an environment in Republican-led states where many policies seemingly contrast with public opinion. To investigate potential sources of support for a variety of types of restrictions, we analyze an original survey of over 7,500 verified donors, 1,500 affluent individuals, and 1,000 members of the general public conducted in 2019–2020. The most extreme restrictions, such as bans with no rape exception, are not popular with Republicans in the aggregate from any of the three groups—Republican donors, affluent individuals, or voters—but they are supported by the small and potentially influential group of highly religious Republicans who report that abortion is one of their most important issues.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf012","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf012","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4072,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Large-Scale Agricultural Investments, Employment Opportunities, and Communal Conflict","authors":"Alexander De Juan, Lisa Hoffmann, Jann Lay","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/732946","doi":"10.1086/732946","journal_full":"The Journal of Politics","dist":0.3875,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do Domestic Climate Rulings Make Climate Commitments More Credible?

The article argues that the digital engagement of Chinese women on Instagram plays a critical role in offsetting the limitations found in domestic social media platforms. This is vital for preserving certain vanished recollections, disseminating feminist narratives, and building gendered collective memory that challenges and reframes the often-distorted and stereotypical perceptions of Chinese women in public consciousness within China’s domestic media landscape.

Removal also causes an increase in hospitalizations for mental illness and non-narcotic crimes. There is little evidence of adverse health effects for birth parents.

A firm with imperfect access to equity financing covers financing needs through costly sources: an intermediary and retained cash. The firm’s financing capacity is endogenously determined by either the liquidation value of assets (asset-based) or the intermediary’s going-concern valuation of the firm’s cash flows (cash flow-based). The optimal contract is implemented with defaultable debt—specifically unsecured credit lines and senior-secured debt—and features risk-sharing via bankruptcy. When the firm does well, it repays its debt in full. When it does poorly, distress resolution mirrors U.S. bankruptcy procedures (Chapters 7 and 11). Secured and unsecured debt are complements because risk-sharing via unsecured debt increases secured debt capacity.

In June 2024, there were 7.7 million Venezuelan migrants and refugees worldwide, of which 1.5 million have settled in Peru. Lima, the city hosting the majority of Venezuelans in Peru (R4V 2022), seems to be the final destination on their migration trajectory. Despite challenges and barriers related to the complex legal status landscape, the city fulfils aspirations and needs that drove Venezuelans to leave their country. Most importantly, Lima allows them to fulfil economic needs that are sufficient to survive and support those left behind. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the principal challenges confronted by forced migrants from Venezuela on the labor market of Lima (Peru), the adaptation and coping strategies they employ to overcome them and how this situation influences their decisions on further (im)mobility. The results are based on a mixed-method approach with the use of quantitative and qualitative research methods.

An outstanding example of this is Hungary, a destination for both retirement migrants from Western Europe and older people, mainly ethnic Hungarian migrants from neighbouring regions. While an increasing body of literature deals with the spatiality of international retirement migration, only a few studies have analysed the settlement choices of older immigrants in receiving countries. To fill this gap, our paper presents a multi-level analysis of the spatial characteristics of the older adults who are settling in Hungary. We examine two different groups of older people arriving in Hungary to identify the factors that may influence their choice of place of residence and explain the possible reasons for their mobility. The empirical data pertain to German and Ukrainian individuals aged over 60, whose migration choices, because their places of residence are characterised by remarkably different geographical patterns, can be considered distinct. Based on a multivariate statistical analysis of the size and distribution of German and Ukrainian migrants aged 60 and over, we found that only some of the German older adults arrive in Hungary as ‘classic’ lifestyle migrants. However, many of them live in urban areas or disadvantaged regions. In contrast, older persons from Ukraine, primarily ethnic Hungarians, are concentrated along the Ukrainian border or choose to reside in urban municipalities located farther from the border. Data suggest that retired people arriving in Hungary are driven mainly by economic strategies, which, in our view, can be identified as different forms of geoarbitrage, namely, higher pension-seeking among Ukrainians and escaping relative deprivation among Germans. The increasing number of older migrants entails new challenges at the local level, requiring municipalities to expand social services, underscoring the political relevance of our findings.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00455-x","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00455-x","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5293,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Crisisology no more?

The few existing studies show conflicting results: poor and deteriorating health can be associated with both higher and lower propensity to return‐migrate, depending on the context.

First, we use quantitative survey data to explore the relationship between health and return intentions of older immigrants from both high‐migration‐pressure countries and Western European countries. Second, in order to dig deeper into the complexity of return‐migration decision‐making, we draw on interviews with three groups of older migrants in Italy: retired labour migrants from Morocco; the ‘zero‐generation’ Albanian parents of labour migrants who have joined their children in Italy; and British international retirement migrants. Results differ for each group and type of analysis, but the role of health and the location of children stand out as key factors in the stay‐return dilemma.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70042","doi":"10.1111/imig.70042","journal_full":"International Migration","dist":0.5873,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Caring Across Time and Borders: Ukrainian Returnees' Journeys Towards Ageing and Belonging","authors":"Alina Penkala, Ilse Derluyn, Ine Lietaert","abstract":"The migration of Ukrainian women to Italy over the last three decades has been portrayed in diverse ways, with many narratives emphasising their vital economic and social contributions both in Italy and back home, whilst others cast these women, many of them mothers, as threats to Ukrainian families and the nation.

Through three autobiographical interviews, our study explores how these women have mothered across borders, navigated care responsibilities and dealt with disenfranchised grief.

Strong bonds formed with Italian families—and maintained across borders—now influence feelings of belonging back in the home country.

Recent research also highlights how policy toward a single refugee group can shift drastically over time. What does this fragmentation and ad hocism mean for the everyday life of refugee and asylum-seeking communities? How does it affect the lived experience of refuge and protection in India? This article tackles these questions by examining the case of the Rohingya refugees in India—once granted official Long Term Visas as asylum seekers in 2012, now marked for detention and deportation as illegal immigrants in 2025. Drawing from fieldwork conducted with refugees, community leaders, and NGOs working across the country, this article examines how the combination of fragmented (forced) migration governance and divergent settlement patterns of the Rohingya in India has resulted in a form of fragmented protection, marked by different degrees of negotiated access to services such as health and education. At the same time, the precarity of the Rohingyas’ legal status in India (as UNHCR card-holders who are simultaneously deemed illegal by the Indian government) profoundly influences the operational space and potential impact of this fragmented protection. I show how fragmented protection is increasingly shaped by structural shocks including the political (negative government stance on refugees), the discursive (growing negative public perception of the Rohingya), and the administrative (drives toward all-encompassing digital identification schemes inhibiting the space for policy discretion).","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251337057","doi":"10.1177/01979183251337057","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5507,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Public Belief in the “Great Replacement Theory”","authors":"James Dennison, Alexander Kustov","abstract":"The “Great Replacement Theory” (GRT) is an extremist narrative that has gained increased prominence within anti-immigration and conspiratorial discourses in Western societies, yet remains understudied.

While recent migration studies have increasingly recognized the importance of immobility in understanding migration, research on refugee experiences remains predominantly focused on mobility from displacement through transit to settlement. This mobility-centric perspective overlooks the immobilities embedded within the broader mobility, which generate distinct temporalities that impact refugee experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce experiential time as an analytical framework designed to capture the subjective, fluid, and multifaceted temporalities that refugees navigate. We view displacement as a dynamic process with distinct phases, emphasizing the interplay of two temporal properties: speed and duration. Through this lens, we identify four categories of experiential time: sluggish, stuck, racing, and shock each reflecting unique emotional and psychological responses to temporal experiences. This framework offers a fresh perspective on how refugees simultaneously experience and navigate the intersections of mobility and immobility, yet in distinctive ways.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf031","doi":"10.1093/jrs/feaf031","journal_full":"Journal of Refugee Studies","dist":0.5351,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"“In the hands of the UN”: remembering Gatumba and resisting encampment in Kenya","authors":"Sophia Balakian","abstract":"In 2014, the Banyamulenge Congolese community in Nairobi commemorated the tenth anniversary of a massacre in Burundi’s Gatumba refugee camp. The anniversary coincided with a Kenyan government directive to deport refugees from the capital city to UN-run camps. In this context, the community invited UNHCR and NGO staff to the memorial, where they connected the violence they experienced in Gatumba to their resistance to future encampment. By hosting humanitarian workers, the community inverted the roles of host and guest, speaking in a collective voice that was impossible in individual bureaucratic interviews. An ethnographic account of the Gatumba memorial broadens boundaries for understanding refugees’ resistance to hegemonic regimes.

This study investigates the changes in socio‐demographic characteristics of people moving in and out of one of the most dynamic inner‐city neighbourhoods in Prague – Karlín. The main objective of the paper is to understand and explain the impact of migration and quantify the characteristics of gentrification migration streams in this neighbourhood within the period 2010–2020. The migration data contains information regarding gender, age, marital status, state citizenship, and place of in‐ and out‐migration. We demonstrate migration behaviour within the transforming housing estate from the 1960s, the new‐built gentrification in New Karlín, and the classical gentrification in Old Karlín. The main outcomes of the analyses confirm that Karlín is going through an intense wave of classical gentrification, which is primarily driven by the influx of foreign migration and the displacement of the domestic population to other parts of the city. We argue that Karlín is a precursor of inner‐city development in Prague and other Central and Eastern European cities, and gentrification has become the most important urban transformation process in contemporary Central and Eastern European cities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70056","doi":"10.1002/psp.70056","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.514,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Who Emigrates From a Wealthy, Peaceful Country?

Exploring the Link Between Migrant Integration Policies and Pro‐Immigrant Sentiment","authors":"Riccardo Borgoni, Andrea Gilardi, Alessandra Michelangeli, Kateryna Tkach","abstract":"The increasing inflow of migrants from outside Europe has intensified efforts to promote social and economic inclusion while reinforcing social cohesion. These efforts are essential for fostering a fair society, which, in turn, supports a dynamic economy that benefits everyone. In this paper, we examine the relationship between integration policies and pro‐immigrant sentiment, which is regarded as a key‐factor in facilitating migrant integration. Our analysis draws on data from the European Social Survey (Round 10), which provides insights into natives' attitudes towards immigrants across a wide range of European countries during the period from September 2020 to August 2022. The empirical design is based on an extended version of the proportional‐odds cumulative logit model to estimate potential nonlinear effects of explanatory variables in determining pro‐immigrant sentiment. Additionally, we account for potential endogeneity between pro‐immigrant attitudes and immigrant inflows. Our findings reveal a bell‐shaped relationship between migrant integration policies and pro‐immigrant sentiment. This suggests that countries transitioning toward more inclusive policies tend to experience a rise in positive attitudes toward immigrants. In contrast, in countries where integration policies are already highly inclusive, further expansion may be associated with a decline in support. This bell‐shaped pattern also emerges when examining public perceptions of grants' contributions to the economy of host countries. The relationship becomes convex when focusing on views regarding the cultural impact of migrants. These distinct patterns carry important and differentiated policy implications, highlighting the need for context‐specific strategies in advancing integration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70053","doi":"10.1002/psp.70053","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.7301,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Negotiation of Socio‐Spatial Background Among Elite Chinese University Graduates","authors":"Benjamin Mulvey, Boya Li","abstract":"An increasingly rich body of literature focuses on the relationship between socio‐spatial background, emotional attachment to place, and aspirations surrounding higher education.

Drawing on interviews with 40 final‐year master's degree students at an elite Chinese university, from three social class factions, we explore how socio‐spatial inequality is embodied and reflected in the future aspirations of students, particularly in the form of attachments to (or lack thereof) particular places, and the internalisation of cultural logics that stigmatise rurality and associate it with ‘low quality’. These processes represent under‐recognised means through which social stratification is embodied and reproduced in the Chinese context, creating additional barriers for non‐affluent students from rural backgrounds in ‘keeping up’ with urban peers after graduation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70055","doi":"10.1002/psp.70055","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5042,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Rapid emergence of a maths gender gap in first grade","authors":"P.

Basic oculomotor biases towards the image centre and along the horizontal meridian develop until adolescence, matching developmental changes in visual sensitivity and cortex. Finally, while the tendency for visual exploration continuously increases, fixation patterns become less idiosyncratic and more canonical throughout adolescence.

Statistical modelling, which accounts for network dependence in cross-sectional data, finds signals of ‘contagion’ within chatting, respect and money-borrowing networks. This indicates that social influence contributes to FGMC maintenance.

More recently, it has been argued, from an evolutionary standpoint, that equality may paradoxically increase gender differences, because it provides more freedom for men and women to pursue innate preferences. However, this paradox has primarily been examined with this cross-country methodology, opening up for other cultural differences to drive the results. For instance, measures developed in Protestant and Germanic-speaking countries, may not work the same in other cultural clusters of countries, and may not have the same statistical qualities there (e.g., in terms of reliability). Here, we reanalyze the results from multiple studies on the gender-equality paradox with country-level data available. We find that gender differences covary more strongly with cultural regions and data quality than gender equality, and that any variable higher in the West appears to achieve similar correlations as gender equality. Also, controlling for cultural regions consistently and strongly attenuates the association with gender equality, including to become statistically nonsignificant, or to switch direction. In other words, the baseline associations differ between and within cultural clusters (a Simpson’s paradox), suggesting there is no simple causal relation between gender equality and expressed gender differences. Similarly, controlling for data quality indicators strongly attenuates the paradox. Finally, we show that, with and without controls, there is no consistent paradoxical association across many of the largest cross-cultural studies on gender differences, including newly analyzed data. The same is true for other country development variables considered in the gender-equality paradox literature.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2422247122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2422247122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4958,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Reinforcement generates systematic differences without heterogeneity","authors":"Alexandros Gelastopoulos, Lucas Sage, Arnout van de Rijt","abstract":"Inequality in outcomes may emerge through a reinforcement process in which stochastic variation in values is determined by prior values but may also originate in preexisting differences in unobserved factors.

Since the local impacts are neither well quantified nor widely recognized, we lack policies and common practices to mitigate the potential associated welfare loss in affected communities. Based on a nationwide dataset combining property transactions and large-scale solar photovoltaic (LSSPV) sites, we analyze the heterogeneous effects of LSSPV on property prices and the associated causal pathways. Difference-in-differences estimates show that LSSPV significantly increases agricultural or vacant land value by about 19.4% within a 2-mile radius, while simultaneously reducing residential property values within 3 miles by about 4.8%. The estimated average negative impact on home values is primarily driven by site proximity and diminishes with both distance and time. Effect estimates are more robust to alternative specifications when proximity pairs with visibility rather than invisibility, but no evidence suggests visibility significantly amplifies the proximity effect. Heterogeneous effect estimates indicate that high solar lease potential, being in heavily Democratic-leaning counties, and brownfield redevelopment largely mitigate the negative residential value impact. The analysis reveals no significant heterogeneity across a few factors, including varying site visibility, directional orientation of properties relative to the LSSPV site, and different tracking systems. Evidence indicates that the negative impact on residential values might mainly stem from negative perceptions, but channels through physical conditions cannot be entirely dismissed. Our assessment provides benchmark information for local externality mitigation plans, potentially reducing community opposition and expediting the renewable energy transition.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2418414122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2418414122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4906,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Dismantling EPA’s research office jeopardizes environmental safety, public health, and US competitiveness","authors":"Scott Glaberman, H.

Using wearable electrocardiographic (ECG) sensors to monitor heart rate patterns, we apply multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis to track group synchrony over time. We find that the Rua de Fogo, driven by its sensory-rich and ritualized interactions, elicited the highest levels of emotional synchrony, surpassing even key moments of the game. This synchrony was sustained across participants, including the driver of the team delegation bus, who was not physically engaged in the ritual.

In this fMRI study, we investigated how belief modulates narrative processing through belief context—the initial information indicating the speaker’s credibility—and actual belief—the truth value ultimately assigned by the listener. Across two experiments, participants listened to narratives preceded by contexts explicitly stating whether the speaker was lying or telling the truth. Then, after listening to the narratives, they were asked to rate their actual belief. To investigate the effects of (dis)belief on narrative processing, we analyzed neural synchronization using inter-subject-correlation analysis and inter-subject representational similarity analysis. In both experiments, we successfully differentiated (dis)belief contexts by modeling neural synchronization patterns, despite an actual “belief-bias” at the behavioral level. This indicates a unique neural pattern related to each belief context. Furthermore, our results revealed a dissociation between belief and disbelief in both contextual and actual (dis)belief. Per each narrative, belief and disbelief were associated with increased synchrony within the default mode network, but in distinguishable parcels. These findings highlight the influence of (dis)belief on narrative processing at both behavioral and neural levels. Behaviorally, the observed belief-bias supports the notion of belief as a cognitive default. Neurally, we suggest that belief and disbelief can be understood as fostering qualitatively distinct processing or interpretation of the same narrative, which are then reflected in shared neural responses among individuals who hold similar belief states.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2422396122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2422396122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4516,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Measuring premature and cumulative family member bereavement: Racial disparities and later mortality risk","authors":"Michelle Chang, Theodore F.

Using a longitudinal US sample of 27,985 participants from the Health and Retirement Study (1992 to 2020) who experienced at least one lifetime loss, hierarchical linear models accounting for participants nested within households showed that Black participants and Native American participants had higher premature and cumulative burden of family member loss over the lifetime than all other racial groups across all three indices. These effects remained for Black participants after controlling for covariates such as parental education, household size, and years in the study. Second, we found that loss burden at study enrollment prospectively related to all-cause mortality. Depending on prematurity, each additional loss related to higher odds of dying during the study period after controlling for covariates such as chronic health conditions. Together, our work leverages prospective, longitudinal methodologies to identify racial disparities in exposure to earlier and repeated death and its impact on mortality among the bereaved. The proposed measurement approach has future applications for understanding how loss exposure—both “too soon” and “too much”—predicts poor health and earlier mortality.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2313600122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2313600122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4332,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Global health and climate benefits from walking and cycling infrastructure","authors":"Adam Millard-Ball, Monisha Reginald, Yasmina Yusuf, Christopher Bian","abstract":"We use a globally consistent dataset—Google Environmental Insights Explorer—to quantify how urban form and transport infrastructure affect walking and cycling rates in 11,587 cities from 121 countries across six continents.

Density has the strongest effects in wealthier countries where travelers often have more travel choices, while in lower-income places, walking and cycling may be primarily driven by financial constraints. We also find positive effects of bicycle lanes (proxying for a wider array of street design practices) on both walking and cycling. In the median city, each new km of bicycle lanes is associated with ~13,400 additional km yr -1 of bicycle travel.

Y. Cyrus Chu, Chang-Ching Lin, Shih-Ting Lu, Ching-Yuan Kao","abstract":"In vitro fertilization (IVF) affects human fertility by 1) increasing the probability of multiple births through the transfer of multiple embryos, 2) raising the proportion of dizygotic twins, which leads to a higher occurrence of one-boy-one-girl twins, and 3) enabling gender selection through preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) when parents have specific gender preferences. While the above-mentioned increase in multiple births is well documented, the impact on the twins’ gender composition remains under-explored, partly because 2) and 3) are intertwined. This study uses millions of administrative observations from Taiwan to disentangle the effects of IVF on twin birth rates, gender composition, and parental preferences. Families are grouped by maternal age and family wealth across different periods, enabling a comparative analysis of socioeconomic and temporal factors. By examining the gender composition of first-born twins within these age-wealth-time groups, we can identify and test whether parents have gender preferences for one-boy-one-girl twins. Our empirical evidence reveals a significant increase in IVF adoption, particularly among older and wealthier mothers. The proportion of one-boy-one-girl twins among first-birth twins has risen from 20.42 to 41.86% over the past 30 y, and this proportion increases with wealth ranking, significantly exceeding expected ratios in the absence of gender preference. Parental gender preference contributed to approximately 10.95% of one-boy-one-girl twins among the wealthiest group, revealing a significant impact of parental preference on twin gender composition. These trends raise ethical and social concerns regarding reproductive technologies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2426838122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2426838122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4319,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Public health suffers when those in power dismiss knowledge","authors":"Stephan Lewandowsky","abstract":"“Knowledge is power”—or at least it was when Sir Francis Bacon coined this phrase in the 16th century.

Using a choice experiment among Swiss adolescents who are in the process of choosing their vocational training occupation, this article demonstrates that women and men have surprisingly similar preferences for workplace characteristics. In contrast, skill requirements are better predictors of gender differences in occupational preferences. We find that technical skills are critical in explaining gendered occupational preferences, with occupations that rely more heavily on new technologies attracting fewer women. At the same time, both genders prefer occupations that emphasize social interactions, suggesting that the prominent ‘people’ versus ‘things’ distinction does not adequately capture gendered occupational preferences.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf034","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf034","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.5512,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Moral authority over risk classifications: how data professionals shape the uneven algorithmization of life insurance","authors":"Alexander Gamerdinger","abstract":"How do data professionals claim moral authority over market classifications?

In the publicly sensitive context of pricing, actuarial fairness guides the classification of risk into groups through transparent models, creating barriers to ML adoption. In the insulated context of claims prevention, data scientists’ moral frameworks and technical fairness metrics justify individual risk classifications that deliver equal opportunities for customers in need.

Differing from neoliberal principles, Chinese finance is characterized by longer time horizons, less conditionality, and more state capital. Consequently, a consensus has emerged that China is gradually reshaping the global financial architecture toward a post-neoliberal order. Through a mixed-methods analysis, I draw from three statistical databases and 132 interviews to show that since peaking in 2017, Chinese financing has fallen drastically by end of 2023 across both debt (96 per cent) and equity (68 per cent). I find that Chinese financing is no longer perceived in China, the West, or host countries as providing a scalable alternative to Western sources. Challenging the current consensus, I argue that we need to adjust expectations to recognize a diminished impact. Instead, China’s evolving role includes promoting a variety of both neoliberal and post-neoliberal principles in the adjacent fields of debt renegotiations, development finance norms, and project finance practices.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf030","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf030","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.3893,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Consumer Authorities in Europe: Policing Markets or Empowering Consumers?","authors":"Jacint Jordana, Joaquín Rozas‐Bugueño, Juan Carlos Triviño‐Salazar","abstract":"Consumer protection authorities are vital for domestic markets and the smooth functioning of the EU common market. Established several decades ago, these authorities have different institutional designs in different European countries. This paper aims to identify them and assess their main variations. Based on the literature at the intersection of consumer protection regimes and regulatory governance, we propose a theoretical distinction between enforcement‐focused authorities and service delivery‐oriented authorities. Specifically, we suggest these principles lead to either a supervisory model, which disciplines market actors, or an empowering model, which gives citizens the keys to prevent market abuses. To empirically test whether these two models capture the variety of institutional designs and practices consumer authorities may adopt, we have identified four different dimensions that characterize their connections to politics, business, and citizens: political autonomy, social accountability, administrative enforcement, and consumer awareness. We begin by discussing which dimensions are associated with which model and then examine the presence of the two models across Europe. Our analysis is based on Bayesian factorial analysis and a Ward.D cluster construction grounded in an original dataset of institutional characteristics from general consumer authorities in 27 EU countries, the UK, and Norway, offering empirical evidence to support our argument. The results suggest that EU efforts to build institutional harmonization have had limited success. Likewise, traditional administrative models across Europe may no longer hold the same relevance as previously indicated in research. Our findings show instead that consumer authorities in Europe can generally be distinguished from each other based on these two principles, though many operate with a hybrid approach.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.70033","doi":"10.1111/gove.70033","journal_full":"Governance","dist":0.4485,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Legislative Hearings and Presidential Cabinet Management","authors":"Don S.

Using a quasi‐experimental identification strategy, we analyze original data on the careers of over 560 ministers from South Korea appointed pre‐ and post‐hearings. We find that competence types are more likely to be retained than loyalty types after legislative hearings. However, loyalty types are more likely to receive promotion—that is, transfer from their initial cabinet appointment to a higher‐prestige post—than competence types after legislative hearings. Additionally, we find that agency performance is better under competence types than under loyalty types.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.70032","doi":"10.1111/gove.70032","journal_full":"Governance","dist":0.3418,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"European integration and state capture: insights from the EU’s earlier Eastern enlargement","authors":"Visnja Vukov","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2025.2513652","doi":"10.1080/13501763.2025.2513652","journal_full":"Journal of European Public Policy","dist":0.4576,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The politics of production and social reproduction","authors":"Dorothee Bohle, Visnja Vukov","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2025.2513655","doi":"10.1080/13501763.2025.2513655","journal_full":"Journal of European Public Policy","dist":0.4239,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Robodebt and the limits of learning: exploring meaning-making after a crisis","authors":"Daniel Casey, Maria Maley","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2025.2513651","doi":"10.1080/13501763.2025.2513651","journal_full":"Journal of European Public Policy","dist":0.3353,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The asymmetry of EU socio-economic governance: theoretical fault lines and constructivist avenues for future research","authors":"Amandine Crespy","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/13501763.2025.2516120","doi":"10.1080/13501763.2025.2516120","journal_full":"Journal of European Public Policy","dist":0.4811,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Policy performance in crisis: evaluating federalism and multi-party governance","authors":"Saahir Shafi, Daniel J.

There is no set definition of what an EHU is, but in this paper, we explore the popular support for different designs of an EHU, including a pillar in which healthcare policy competences are shared between the EU and national governments, a risk‐sharing, and a redistributive pillar among countries. The analysis draws on two conjoint experiments in which respondents are presented with policy packages, as well as on a follow‐up survey on political attitudes. One of the experiments focuses on a central fiscal capacity that provides financial help to countries hit by adverse shocks, including financing of national healthcare spending, while the second focuses on joint procurement of medical countermeasures. The surveys were fielded in five EU countries at the end of March/beginning of April 2020, in July 2020, and in November 2022. Our findings are the following: there is support for all three pillars of an EHU, which moreover rises with trust in the EU; respondents tend to prefer a health‐related fiscal capacity to other forms of EU fiscal capacity; direct experience with serious Covid‐19 infection raises both trust in the EU and support for the EU sharing in social policy competences; and more trust has a larger positive effect on support for an EHU for those without serious Covid‐19 experience than for those with.

We consolidate these into five underlying concepts (CHAIN): Closeness; Homogeneity; Avoidance; Identities; and Networks. We introduce a parsimonious definition of cultural capture: social and psychological processes that bias regulators' beliefs and behaviors, aligning them with those of the regulatees and marginalizing alternative viewpoints. A key contribution of this article is developing a set of 33 novel behavioral indicators to examine these five concepts empirically and clarify their relationship to regulatory capture.

Despite this legal entitlement, we argue that local political and economic factors (continue to) matter for childcare expansion and regional variation in coverage. We expect left‐wing local political majorities to be associated with higher expansion and coverage rates. At the same time, tight local fiscal constraints should limit partisan room for maneuver and should slow down expansion. Analyzing local‐level data on childcare coverage rates, socioeconomic context factors, and government partisanship, we find evidence of conditional effects between fiscal and partisan variables.

It explores how collective defenses can take on a variety of empirical forms, whether as interaction-order dynamics, cultural discourses and narratives, or institutionalized rules and arrangements. And it shows how this understanding of collective defenses can be incorporated into still larger frameworks of inquiry into power and inequality in social life. It also suggests ways in which methodological innovations can help the study of these shared defenses become more transparent, nonarbitrary, and rigorous, allaying concerns sociologists long have had about investigating unconscious processes. By highlighting the formation, deployment, and potential undoing of collective defense mechanisms, this article illuminates an exciting new terrain for sociologists to explore and opens up new possibilities for more constructive and non-defensive real-world problem solving.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251341575","doi":"10.1177/00031224251341575","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.4096,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Abortion Policies in a Polarizing World Society, 1970 to 2020","authors":"Wade M. Cole","abstract":"This article examines how global contention over reproductive rights influenced national abortion polices over the past half-century. I glean four models of normative contestation in world society and its consequences for diffusion and institutionalization, arguing that a theory of polarization best accounts for developments in norms and policies on abortion. Fixed-effects regression analyses of up to 160 countries between 1970 and 2020 test the empirical implications of this argument. Several noteworthy findings emerge. First, country linkages to international nongovernmental organization (INGOs) predict abortion liberalization, but memberships in “illiberal” international organizations and alliances are associated with more restrictive abortion policies. Second, these relationships are conditioned by a shifting global context: in recent years, the association between illiberal affiliations and policy restrictions strengthened, while the liberalizing effect of INGOs weakened. And third, illiberal affiliations disrupt or “spoil” the effect of INGO linkages on policy expansions, illustrating the consequences of mutual engagement between rival transnational networks. Similar patterns characterize the effects of women’s and pro-family INGOs on abortion policies in the post–Cold War period. These findings point to growing polarization between liberal and illiberal forces in world society and suggest the incipient institutionalization of rival norms on abortion.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251335964","doi":"10.1177/00031224251335964","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.5404,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Contesting the State: Embodied Threat and the Emergence of Prisoner Mobilization","authors":"David Jonathan Knight","abstract":"Prior studies cast U.S. imprisonment as politically demobilizing. This article complicates that proposition by exploring when, and how, threat under penal confinement leads people to mobilize. Using interviews with currently incarcerated and recently released men across three states, I show that although imprisonment generally fosters political inaction, collective mobilization does arise under certain conditions. First, people in prison mobilize in response to embodied threats —fundamental threats eliciting visceral reactions that signal future harm (i.e., premature death or permanent incapacitation). Second, to collectively mobilize, a subpopulation of similarly threatened prisoners must be present and see the threats as a shared problem. Collective prisoner mobilization is more likely when both conditions are present; mobilization is unlikely when neither condition is present; and individual political contention is more likely when conditions are partially present. This range of political responses among incarcerated people is more dynamic than previously reported. Imprisonment has selective political effects, mobilizing the most repressed individuals within prison to devise new strategies to contest their repression.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251340401","doi":"10.1177/00031224251340401","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.4983,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Intergenerational mobility into doctoral education across Europe","authors":"Jouni Helin, Kristian Koerselman, Terhi Nokkala, Eija Räikkönen","abstract":"Despite increasing concerns over socioeconomic barriers in access to doctoral education, relatively little is known about the degree to which PhDs are selected in terms of their social background.

At the same time, the efficiency of anti-discrimination policies relies on the support for and knowledge of these policies. We examined to what extent landlords have knowledge of the anti-discrimination legislation in Belgium and whether their level of knowledge is related to their support for anti-discrimination policy measures. For these purposes, we performed a survey including vignettes of 223 private landlords. We find that landlords successfully recognize discriminatory behaviour based on income and ethnic origin. Besides, private landlords’ support for anti-discrimination measures is relatively high, and more so for compliance as opposed to deterrence measures. Importantly, both knowledge and support are found to be strongly related, with more knowledge relating to more support for general, targeted and compliance measures. The exception, however, is the link with support for deterrence measures (e.g., correspondence testing with sanctions or compulsory training sessions).","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso_a_00017","doi":"10.1162/euso_a_00017","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.4817,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Union dissolution and children’s educational achievement: separating effects of school and non-school environments","authors":"Peter Fallesen, Giampiero Passaretta, Simon Skovgaard Jensen","abstract":"We study whether the educational disadvantage of children from households where parents have dissolved their union is due to selection or deteriorating non-school environments and whether exposure to school environments compensates or exacerbates such disadvantage. We apply a differential exposure approach (DEA) to Danish population data collecting public-school reading comprehension tests. The approach exploits variation in children’s birth dates and test administration dates to decompose children’s learning as the product of joint exposure to school and non-school environments. We find that children experiencing parental separation have 5–7 per cent lower test scores, with lower learning returns to non-school environments, and diminishing learning outcomes proportional to time spent in separated households. Critically, school appears to neither mitigate nor exacerbate these achievement gaps, suggesting that degrading of non-school environment post-separation primarily impacts children’s learning.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf026","doi":"10.1093/esr/jcaf026","journal_full":"European Sociological Review","dist":0.493,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"When a door closes, who can access the window? Second chance alternatives for higher education as an institutionalized ‘compensatory advantage’ mechanism","authors":"Carmel Blank, Eyal Bar-Haim","abstract":"In Israel, a high school matriculation diploma is a prerequisite for academic studies. ‘Second chance’ alternatives can bypass this requirement. Although originally designed to offer disadvantaged groups greater access to higher education, the alternatives may also serve as a ‘compensatory advantage’ mechanism for students from affluent backgrounds. This study examines both possibilities. Based on administrative data of children born in Israel from 1978-1983, a logistic regression analysis was performed that predicts the odds of being accepted to higher education studies. Interactions are between students’ background characteristics – parental education, their class and ethnicity – and high school matriculation. Additional analysis predicts future income of high-road and second-chance users from different backgrounds. The findings consistently show that students from advantaged backgrounds utilize second chance mechanisms more often than disadvantaged students do. It appears that second chance alternatives represent an example of an institutionalized system of ‘compensatory advantages’ that benefits students from affluent backgrounds.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf025","doi":"10.1093/esr/jcaf025","journal_full":"European Sociological Review","dist":0.5257,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Social origins and socioeconomic outcomes: a combined twin and adoption study","authors":"Arno Van Hootegem, Adrian Farner Rogne, Caroline Tveter Cros, Ole Røgeberg, Torkild Hovde Lyngstad","abstract":"Parents and children tend to have similar socioeconomic status (SES). Sociological theory has often emphasized the role of social mechanisms in intergenerational transmission, including the influence of the broader rearing environment as well as parental investments and aid, but often not allotted an important role to genetics. Accumulating evidence suggests that genetics play an important role in the transmission of SES from parents to children. Yet, estimates differ substantially across data sets, measures and methods. Using two research designs that account for potential genetic confounding, and high-quality data from Norway, we estimate the strength of the intergenerational social transmission of a range of SES indicators. By triangulating data and designs, we obtain estimates that are more robust to idiosyncratic modelling assumptions.

In this study, we propose that the relationship between diversity and state-making depends on the degree of intergroup contact between different ethnoreligious groups, which varies with locally fractionalized and regionally segregated societies. We hypothesize that high intergroup contact in fractionalized localities contributes to intergroup noncooperation that increases demands for a wide range of state services. Low intergroup contact in regionally segregated societies, by contrast, magnifies fears of intergroup conflict, thus heightening specific demands for state protection. We test these conjectures using original large-N survey data from the tribal areas in Pakistan collected at the time of the region’s incorporation into Pakistani state in 2018. We find that local fractionalization correlates with higher support for state’s comprehensive provision of public goods, except for law enforcement. By contrast, regional segregation correlates with greater support for state law enforcement, but lower support for other state services. Tentative evidence supports the intergroup contact logic and its downstream effects on intergroup noncooperation and the threat of conflict. Overall, our findings suggest that fractionalization can foster comprehensive state-building, while segregation leads to the development of security-oriented states.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf030","doi":"10.1093/esr/jcaf030","journal_full":"European Sociological Review","dist":0.5768,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Ethnic preferences, opportunity structures, and the school segregation process","authors":"Selcan Mutgan, Peter Hedström, Martin Arvidsson","abstract":"Previous research has shown that parents often have strong ethnicity-related school preferences, and it has been suggested that these preferences are consequential for the ethnic segregation of schools.

Using a combination of statistical analyses of school choices and large-scale, empirically calibrated simulations, we investigate how preferences and opportunities jointly influence the students’ mobility between schools and the school segregation that their mobility or lack thereof gave rise to.

Drawing upon twenty in-depth interviews alongside secondary data, the research reveals that despite residing in a host country with greater democratic freedoms and possessing biographical characteristics often associated with political activism, relokanti deliberately refrain from engaging in political expression, even within the private sphere of family interactions. I conceptualize this strategic withdrawal from all transnational political action as silence after exit—a form of political non-engagement shaped by the indirect yet pervasive effects of the extraterritorial spillover of authoritarianism.

Police exert social control on behalf of the state and have been implicated in the maintenance of inequalities, yet are also tasked with managing protests, even protests of the police. So, how do citizens feel about possible restrictions to their right to protest, a critical feature of a functional democracy? While the Black Lives Matter protests of 2020 were largely peaceful, some Americans supported the use of repressive “law and order” responses. Amid simultaneous movements for racial equality (Black Lives Matter) and gendered equality (#MeToo), an intersectional threat perspective encourages us to consider the potentially unique reactions of people who perceive simultaneous threats to multiple privileged identities. We theorize that support for aggressive policing approaches to racial justice protests acts as a synchronized performance of race and gender, enforcing the symbolic boundaries that undergird structural inequalities. Specifically, we suspect that perceived threats to male privilege will also be relevant to these views, at least among those who also perceived threats to white privilege. Using data from the 2020 American National Election Study survey—shortly after the mass protests of the spring and summer of that year—we find a conditional relationship for perceived gender threat, which appears relevant to views of policing the Black Lives Matter protests only among those who also perceive threats to white privilege. We discuss implications for understanding public comprehension of other social phenomena, particularly during multiple overlapping civil rights movements.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf078","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf078","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.4927,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Another elephant in the room? how energy-intensive lifestyles may undermine the fight against climate change","authors":"Lazarus Adua, Brett Clark","abstract":"Climate change represents a major threat to the world, yet policy responses to it have been tepid and ineffective. Recent dire warnings and more frequent climate-related extreme weather events have stirred greater interest in more assertive responses, mostly around two beloved “solutions or policy areas”—transitioning to renewable energy and energy efficiency improvement. This study investigates whether these solutions lessen carbon emissions. More crucially, it scrutinizes whether they are resilient against consumptive lifestyles, an elephant in the room often ignored by governmental decision-makers. Dynamic fixed effects modeling of cross-national longitudinal data shows renewable energies offer opportunities for reducing carbon emissions, but energy intensity prevents us from realizing their full environmental benefits. We find evidence in our analysis that energy intensity as well as other socioeconomic factors are suppressing the influence of renewable energies on carbon emissions. The analysis also shows that the relationship between national energy-intensity, which taps inefficiency, and carbon emissions is moderated by energy-intensive lifestyles (energy use per capita). This finding suggests reducing energy intensity may offer some reductions in carbon emissions, but such efforts must be paired with reductions in energy consumption per capita.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf074","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf074","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.4229,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"“Paper, practice, ancestry, culture”: Racial frames and contested racial/ethnic census categories","authors":"Marissa E Thompson","abstract":"How do individuals and groups frame their appeals to change official racial/ethnic categories and explain their perceptions of the underlying boundaries that such categories reflect?

Using an integrated computational text analysis and qualitative approach, I find that three sets of strategies characterize the general deployment of racial frames across comments. The first describes the broader characteristics that are perceived to define a given category; the second grapples with the historical and contemporary nature of racial/ethnic boundaries; and the third situates the placement of a given group in the existing racial order. I then examine the use of these strategies in reference to the proposed Middle Eastern and North African category and to the existing Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino categories.

The analysis reveals a structural shift in public sentiment beginning in October 2023. Prior to that, opinion was largely reactive to isolated extreme events. Afterward, discourse was driven by polarized narratives: (far)-left slogans such as “Free Palestine” and “From the River to the Sea,” and far-right apocalyptic themes, proxied by interest in Jesus’ Second Coming. Moderate positions—such as “Gaza Genocide” and “Stand with Israel”—are generally marginal. These findings suggest a potential trajectory toward radical U.S. policy on the Israel–Palestine conflict.

This paper explores why and how Jean-Claude Juncker’s European Commission proposed a directive featuring robust regulatory elements despite initial promises of copyright deregulation within the Digital Single Market. Combining insights from political economy and political sociology, I examine the concept of ‘political work’ as the practice of promoting, defending, and implementing a choice of public action.

Utilising a qualitative methodology involving twelve in-depth interviews with Commission officials conducted between 2018 and 2021, alongside document analysis, I demonstrate how Jean-Claude Juncker and his cabinet’s managerial political work, encompassing organisational reforms within the Commission, played a pivotal role in steering the proposed policy towards regulation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v7qe_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/3v7qe_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4284,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Paradigms and Practice","authors":"Nicolas Jabko, Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"Thomas Kuhn’s concept of paradigm has long been a part of ordinary parlance in political science.

We argue that this stance overstates the ideational coherence of policymaking and runs a risk of reification. We re-evaluate the paradigm concept by drawing a link to the recent literature on norm change that emphasizes the importance of practice and process. This analysis highlights theoretical difficulties in using the paradigm concept, as the relation of ideas to practical logics elides the distinctness of paradigmatic frameworks. Without clear boundaries, paradigms lose much of their analytical purchase.

Beginning in the late 1960s, phrases like “Westphalian system” came to convey a package of ideas about international politics limited to the supremacy of state sovereignty, territoriality, and nonintervention, to the exclusion of other meanings. This conceptualization serves as a popular and convenient contrast to a more globalized order, but there are problems with its use: first, because the Westphalian system is an ideal-type that might never have actually existed, the impact of globalization may be exaggerated by scholars who employ it. Second, its use implies a linear progression from some Westphalian configuration toward some “post-Westphalian” state of affairs, whereas actual system change is likely to be more complex.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7ythd_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/7ythd_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.441,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Concept of Power and Its Formation","authors":"张成军","abstract":"Description:‌ This article is a translation of the first two chapters of my Chinese book Power Analysis（权力分析） = Research on Power (ISBN 978-988-76814-1-0), published in 2023.

Our findings suggest that when street-level bureaucrats use AI, citizens will sometimes want bureaucrats that are more similar to themselves, and also tend to consider bureaucrats' technical expertise as less important. This suggests that as AI takes on more of the technical judgments that is part of bureaucratic decision-making, citizens place greater importance on the human elements of bureaucracy, such as shared experiences and empathy.

We focus on how electoral incentives induce politicians to exert effort (electoral control) and how voters remove incompetent politicians (electoral screening). We show that taking voters’ reciprocity concerns into account has important normative implications and can overturn results from standard models that neglect them: increasing transparency about the incumbent’s effort improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently strong reciprocity concerns; increasing benefits from office improves electoral control if and only if voters have sufficiently low reciprocity concerns. Moreover, we show that reciprocity concerns can affect electoral screening, by affecting the competence threshold incumbents must clear to ensure reelection, generating incumbency advantages or disadvantages.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9mv2e_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9mv2e_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4717,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Penalties for Particularism and Partisanship?

This study examines two key features of commonplace clientelism that may govern whether and to what extent citizens deem it punishable by the law. We posit a “particularism penalty,” by which citizens desire greater punishment for actions targeting narrower social groups, and an “outgroup actor penalty”, by which preferred punishment is greater for ethnic-political opponents. A survey experiment with Kikuyu and Luo respondents in Kenya reveals that respondents prefer more punishment for explicitly targeting supporters — coethnics or copartisans — versus general people, with little difference between coethnics and copartisans, regardless of the perpetrator’s partisanship. At the same time, they systematically prefer more punishment for partisan outgroup actors. These findings underscore that public opinion would support a legal evolution away from clientelism towards supporters, even as citizens remain more lenient towards ingroup members.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avtqh_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/avtqh_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4937,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Chinese Cinematic Visions: Popular Film, Strategic Ontology, and Prospects for Conflict","authors":"Jarrod Hayes, Adam B Lerner","abstract":"The People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) re-emergence as a major world power has prompted substantial questions regarding its aims and the potential for future global conflict. While many studies have approached these questions through the traditional lenses of foreign and security policy analysis, this study undertakes an analysis of contemporary Chinese popular cinema. The core premise is that popular media like cinema are important components of social systems of meaning making, informing everyday strategic ontologies of the international system. Film offers insight into how societies understand themselves as political actors in relation to others on the world stage, both reflecting and reinforcing dominant strategic ontologies. Our discourse analysis of 20 recent box office hits in the PRC thus provides clues into potential future policymaking logics. Within the article, we place particular emphasis on how representations of self and other enable and bound PRC agency on the world stage. Among multiple findings, we argue that the films reveal that the PRC understands itself as, above all, a status quo power with great respect for both international law and other actors’ sovereignty—a positive sign for those hoping to avoid military conflict. Nevertheless, the films also highlight deep and longstanding grievances over foreign interference in the PRC’s regional sphere of influence that have the potential to stoke conflict if aggravated in the future.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cwnjx_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/cwnjx_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4038,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Long Twilight of Gold: How a Pivotal Practice Persisted in the Assemblage of Money","authors":"Nicolas Jabko, Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"Why has gold persisted as a significant reserve asset despite momentous changes in international monetary relations since the collapse of the classical gold standard? IPE theories have little to say about this question. Conventional accounts of international monetary relations depict a succession of discrete monetary regimes characterized by specific power structures or dominant ideas. To explain the continuous importance of gold, we draw on insights from social psychology and new materialist theories. We argue that international monetary relations should be understood as a complex assemblage of material artifacts, institutions, ideas, and practices. For much of its history, this assemblage revolved around the pivotal practice of referencing money to gold. The centrality of gold as experienced by policymakers had important effects. Using archival and other evidence, we document these effects from the 1944 Bretton Woods conference through the transition to floating exchange rates in the mid 1970s – a period during which most IPE scholars underestimate the role of gold. Power relations and economic ideas were obviously important but contributed little to a fundamental development: the long process of reluctantly coming to terms with the limitations of specie-backed currency, and the progressive and still ongoing de-centering of gold in international monetary relations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ds6bk_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ds6bk_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4344,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Boots on the Ground: Means, Ends, and the American Military Commitment to Europe","authors":"Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the security commitment it entails are cornerstones of the current international order. Despite this centrality, international relations scholarship is ill equipped to explain the origin of the American commitment to Europe in the form of a long-term, peacetime military presence. At the time, this disposition of military forces represented a historically novel practice. The rational and norm-oriented logics of action that characterize much international relations theory explain cooperation as proceeding from a foundation of given interests. This perspective constrains the ability of analysts to make sense of the dynamic nature and potential creativity of cooperative endeavors. Building on a pragmatist understanding of action, this paper conceptualizes cooperation as a contingent process, characterized by the reciprocal relationship of means and ends, through which actors’ initially ambiguous interests become more concrete. The ends of cooperation emerge endogenously, and the potential for creativity is inherent in the process. This dynamic resulted in the specific form of the American commitment to Europe. A pragmatist account foregrounds agency and in doing so draws attention to important developments that traditional analyses may overlook or assume in the effort to reconstruct a pre-existing structure of interests as the basis for cooperation. By underlining the processual cast of action, this paper also helps recontextualize institutionalization as one step within a broader cooperative dynamic.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eg2q3_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/eg2q3_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4426,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Foreign Military Presence and the Changing Practice of Sovereignty: A Pragmatist Explanation of Norm Change","authors":"Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"Recent years have seen an increasing interest among international relations scholars in applications of pragmatist thought. Few works, however, have gone beyond discussing the epistemological and methodological implications of pragmatism. This article draws on a pragmatist understanding of human action to develop a novel explanation of norm change in contexts not amenable to more common analytical approaches. Specifically, concepts derived from pragmatism help explain how the creative recombination of practices by actors in response to changes in the material and social context of action can transform largely tacit notions of appropriate behavior. The article demonstrates the value of the approach by explaining the origin of a common contemporary security practice unknown prior to the Second World War and incompatible with the then-prevailing norms of sovereignty: the long-term, peacetime presence of one state’s military on the territory of another equally sovereign state.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fbgm2_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/fbgm2_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4223,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Toward a Biomethane Strategy for Türkiye: A Comparative Policy Perspective with Italy","authors":"Ibrahim Arinc","abstract":"This study presents the first academically grounded framework for developing a national biomethane strategy in Türkiye, addressing a critical gap in renewable gas governance. Using Italy as a comparative reference within a Most Similar Systems Design (MSSD) framework, the paper applies a structured policy transfer approach supported by multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), a policy comparability matrix, cosine similarity scoring (0.964), SWOT analysis, and the OECD’s Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD) principles. The framework integrates qualitative and quantitative tools to assess alignment in agricultural potential, infrastructure capacity, market regulation, and institutional governance. Key transferable elements from Italy include green certificate schemes, incentive structures for production with grid injection, and stakeholder mechanisms enabling biomethane scale-up. Türkiye’s strengths (e.g., biomass availability), weaknesses (e.g., institutional fragmentation), and opportunities (e.g., EU-aligned reforms) are examined alongside key threats, particularly the intrinsic complexities of its natural gas market and coordination gaps. Italy’s experience further informs broader strategic insights: prioritizing biomethane over biomass-based electricity generation, leveraging models like Biogasdoneright to integrate agriculture and energy, and positioning biomethane as a decarbonization tool for transport and industry—especially under the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). This transition logic emphasizes biomethane in hard-to-electrify sectors, where it adds more systemic value than traditional biomass-to-electricity uses increasingly served by solar and wind. The paper contributes to comparative energy governance literature by offering a replicable framework for institutional lesson-drawing. It provides actionable insights for emerging economies aiming to align bioenergy policy with long-term energy security, circular economy integration, and sustainability transitions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k46wj_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/k46wj_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4022,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Imperial Relations? Hierarchy and Contemporary Base Politics","authors":"Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"The prevailing assumption in discussions of foreign military basing is that such presences are hierarchical in nature. While this was unavoidably the case prior to the Second World War, changes in the normative framework of international politics mean that the relationship of such presences to hierarchy have become an empirical question. Specifically, changes in sovereignty norms and the emergence of territorial and jurisdictional integrity render the linkage between foreign military basing and hierarchy contingent. As a result, the dynamics of some basing arrangements now closely resemble those of other interstate agreements. This analysis regrounds hierarchy in the specific normative context of action and in doing so highlights the implicit reification of the state in contemporary security studies. In practical terms, it shows how assuming hierarchy both overestimates the fragility of the US basing network and, by exaggerating authority relations, obscures the potential for greater fluidity in the basing space.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5zex_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/k5zex_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3935,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Taken at Face Value: How Emotion Expression Does and Does Not Affect Protest Dynamics","authors":"Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld, Ishaan Prasad","abstract":"Understanding the role of emotions in protest is a growing field of research, but existing research does not address the role of emotions once protests start. By applying computer vision models to the expressed emotions of the 37,558 faces in 7,824 geolocated protest images across twelve protest waves in ten countries, this article makes five contributions to the study of emotions and protest. Most importantly, it measures emotions within protest waves, not before them. It also investigates emotions' temporal effects, multiple emotions simultaneously, connects them directly to actual protests, and does so across multiple countries. The results suggest that anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise occur simultaneously throughout a protest, though happiness peaks on the first day. Emotions sometimes correlate with protest size in unexpected directions, and the coefficient signs differ by country. The most consistent finding is that models without lagged terms outperform those with lags, suggesting emotions and protests covary more than the former causes changes in the latter.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q5kd8_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/q5kd8_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5147,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Making sense of gold and governance: the importance of practices and repertoires","authors":"Nicolas Jabko, Sebastian Schmidt","abstract":"Scholars regularly mobilise the concept of policy paradigm to characterise successive periods in which certain ideas appear to structure policymaking.

This article introduces and empirically illustrates two conceptual alternatives. First, it looks at international monetary relations from 1944 through the early 1970s. Instead of simply labelling this period as ‘Keynesian,’ it shows that the enduring centrality of gold was a pivotal practice among policy makers. Second, it considers the governance of the Eurozone in the run-up to the crisis of the 2010s. Rather than viewing this period as ‘neoliberal,’ it highlights a new discursive repertoire of governance that produced both austerity and unconventional policies.

Drawing on data from the Digital Society Project (DSP) and cross-national time-series analysis on the Digital Repression Index (DRI), this study reveals significant differences in the digital authoritarian toolkit across regime types. Closed regimes predominantly utilize tactics such as surveillance, social manipulation, and internet shutdowns, whereas democracies, despite possessing greater digital repression capacities, generally exercise restraint. However, when governed by illiberal leaders, democracies exhibit patterns of digital repression similar to their autocratic counterparts, challenging assumptions about the normative divide between regime types.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rvmj2_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rvmj2_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4392,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Relational Governance and Trust Cultures: Preliminary Insights on Tiwala and Pagsunod in Pasig City, Philippines","authors":"Karl Patrick R.

This perspective challenges dominant Western-centric models that treat trust as a rational, pre-political disposition stabilizing democratic order. Building on an emerging trust cultures framework, the note shows how tiwala and pagsunod reveal trust as continuously contested and reshaped in everyday negotiations of care, legitimacy, and relational presence. These preliminary insights highlight how residents’ moral evaluations of leaders go beyond personalistic charisma to assess governance systems’ responsiveness and moral credibility. They also point to how hybrid governance environments—digital and face-to-face—shape trust cultures in transitional democracies.

How does this tension play in the digital age? To tackle this question, this chapter look at the salient parliamentary debates on the 2019 “copyright in the digital single market” directive, framed as a victory of culture against the market. We contrast this perspective by highlighting that, following the digitalisation of the economy, a new set of values entered the actors’ repertoire: open-access values. Thus, three competing sets of values framed MEPs’ interventions: culture, market, and open access. We argue that in the digital age, the conflict between market and culture that structures copyright policies is rebalanced to fit in a classical market regulation dilemma. Culture values, supporting market regulation to fight GAFA’s monopolies, are opposed to open-access values, supporting a free market to encourage digital innovation. Thus, both sets of values, whereas historically and socially developed in opposition to economic incentives, are mobilised to defend different market approaches (more vs. fewer barriers to entry).","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yef2v_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/yef2v_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3954,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"When Offshoring Threatens Jobs: Lifelong Education and Occupation Choice","authors":"Daisuke Adachi, Lars Skipper","abstract":"The offshoring of manufacturing jobs has replaced low-skilled workers who often lack the relevant skills to transition to new occupations.

Despite low participation rates in training programs, we show that manufacturing workers trained in business services (BS) programs have a 0.9-3.1 percentage point higher probability of transitioning to BS occupations using dynamic difference-in-difference analysis. We then propose and estimate a life-cycle model of occupation and program choice that yields a nested logit conditional choice probability. The program take-up elasticity is lower than the occupation choice elasticity, suggesting that individuals are insensitive to the monetary value of the programs. A counterfactual wage subsidy policy tied to participation in BS-related programs supports transitions from manufacturing to BS occupations and reduces the share of low-skilled individuals leaving the labor force, especially at older ages, demonstrating the potential for a resilient labor market.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7dktj_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/7dktj_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.485,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Predicting Individual Life Trajectories: Addressing Uncertainty in Social Employment Transitions","authors":"Linda Vecgaile, Alessandro Spata, Luiz Felipe Vecchietti, Emilio Zagheni","abstract":"Life course sequences are complex trajectories of interconnected events that shape the future of individuals in multifaceted ways.

Our model forecasts these sequences from which we provide probabilistic assessments of alternative pathways. Through our analysis, we identify seven distinct late-career clusters, ranging from stable full-time employment, which exhibit high predictability and certainty, to persistent unemployment and marginal employment, which demonstrate greater volatility and uncertainty. Alternative pathways predicted by the model suggest that individuals in volatile career trajectories might have transitioned into stable employment under different opportunity structures.

Our identification strategy exploits the conditional in- dependence of closure assignment given observed covariates, with closures primarily driven by external staﬃng constraints rather than family charac- teristics. Using survey data from 14,867 mothers in Germany, we examine both maternal self-reported well-being (WHO-5) and mother-assessed child well-being (KINDL scales). Our causal forest analysis reveals significant dose-response relationships: short closures reduce maternal well-being by -0.097 standard deviations (SD) (95% CI: [-0.136, -0.058]), while longer clo- sures show stronger eﬀects -0.192 SD (95% CI: [-0.261, -0.123]). Children’s outcomes follow similar patterns, with daycare-specific well-being showing large eﬀects (-0.178 SD for longer closures). Mediation analysis reveals that closure eﬀects operate primarily through perceived process quality rather than structural disruptions. For maternal well-being, approximately 53% of the eﬀect is mediated through process quality perceptions, while for child outcomes this proportion reaches up to 100%. Our heterogeneity analysis using decision trees identifies vulnerable subgroups: families without alterna- tive childcare arrangements and those with inflexible work schedules experi- ence disproportionately worse outcomes.

Drawing on Rancière’s theoretical framework of politics, police, and the distribution of the sensible, the research explores how feminist discourse, initially disruptive in digital spaces, is systematically neutralized through ideological reframing, emotional labor, and platform-mediated containment. Based on qualitative interviews with 35 Chinese individuals engaged in feminist and anti-feminist discourse across social media platforms, the study identifies a two-tier process of depoliticization. First, feminist discourse is politicized in the public sphere through nationalist and anti-feminist rhetoric that frames feminism as a foreign, morally suspect ideology, and embeds it into the existing, inherently unequal political discourse framework, as to subsequently deprive it of the legitimacy of mobilization. After that, as the feminist challenge of inequality moves into the private sphere, it is individualized, reframed as a personal relationship issue rather than a structural critique, and absorbed into everyday emotional negotiations, thereby sustaining existing gender norms. The study also demonstrates how digital platforms facilitate this process through algorithmic segregation, commodification of feminist discourse, and the ephemeral nature of viral debates. Ultimately, the research reveals how modern authoritarian systems manage ideological dissent not through outright suppression, but through strategic containment and absorption, ensuring that feminism remains visible yet politically inert. This study contributes to feminist media studies, digital platform research, and contemporary discussions on ideological control by illustrating how depoliticization operates at the nexus of digital culture, nationalist discourse, and intimate relationships in contemporary China.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dkv8r_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/dkv8r_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4716,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Congregations and Communities: The Evolving Social Role of Congregations and Their Involvement in Social Service Provision","authors":"Brad R.

The analysis explores how congregations function as community institutions, their evolving relationships with surrounding neighborhoods, and factors influencing their social service involvement. Key findings reveal that congregations vary significantly in their community engagement, influenced by financial resources, leadership education levels, and ideological orientation. Middle-class congregations in lower-income neighborhoods show the highest levels of social service activity. Most congregations offer short-term assistance through food, shelter, and clothing programs, typically collaborating with secular agencies rather than operating independent programs. The collective contribution represents a substantial supplement to public social services.

Among men, only low-skilled fathers were more likely to be called back than childless men before and after the lockdowns, with a significant decrease in their hiring advantage during the pandemic. These results firstly indicate that employers rely more on assumptions about group productivity when male applicants lack objective measures of productivity. The drop in callbacks during lockdowns further suggests low-skilled fathers’ dramatic increase in caregiving and housework negatively affected employers’ perceptions of their greater productivity.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rcaj8_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rcaj8_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5156,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Narrative Engagement in Story Listening: The Challenge of Age and Vision Loss","authors":"Signe Lund Mathiesen, Amanda Grenier, Walter Wittich, Mahadeo Sukhai, Bjorn Herrmann","abstract":"Narrative engagement offers substantial psychosocial benefits, including cognitive health, emotional and social well-being, and longevity. However, vision loss in older adults can pose challenges in accessing printed narratives. As individuals may shift from print to auditory narratives due to age-related vision loss, understanding how this transition affects narrative engagement becomes crucial. The current work provides a synthesis of the intersection of aging, vision loss, and narrative engagement, focusing on cognitive, emotional, and sensory changes. We discuss how age and vision loss may modify critical components of story engagement, potentially altering narrative consumption and experience. Our research highlights the need to adapt research methodologies and measurement scales to suit older adults and auditory narratives, ensuring they capture unique aspects of auditory engagement and account for sensory impairments. We propose novel directions for studying narrative engagement and offer insights for future research to provide inclusive and accessible narrative forms that support the cognitive and emotional well-being of older adults.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgm5w_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rgm5w_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4386,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Phenomenon of Negation: Anton Chigurh and the Perversion of Merleau-Ponty's \"Phenomenology of Perception\"","authors":"Wafid Kholishatul","abstract":"Anton Chigurh is a character from the novel No Country for Old Men by Cormac McCarthy, which was later made into a movie by directors Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. This article is written to discuss the character of Anton Chigurh through the philosophical framework of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's Phenomenology of Perception. Chigurh represents an extreme or antithetical form of authentic subjectivity in Merleau-Ponty's view. The analysis explores key Merleau-Pontian concepts, including the distinction between the lived body (Leib) and the objective body (Körper), the active nature of perception in constituting reality, the embodied and reciprocal nature of intersubjectivity, and the concept of freedom as situated through the character of Anton Chigurh. Chigurh's interactions with others are analyzed as a form of systematic destruction of intersubjectivity, characterized by the objectification of others and the failure to establish reciprocal engagement. His adherence to uncompromising principles and deterministic view of fate is contrasted with Merleau-Ponty's more nuanced understanding of situated freedom that emphasizes continuous and open engagement with the world. Chigurh functions as a phenomenological anti-subject, embodying a pathological form of being-in-the-world. His character becomes a literary exploration of the denial of the most fundamental mode of human existence, as described by Merleau-Ponty highlighting the unsettling consequences of disengagement from embodied empathy, mutual intersubjectivity, and the ambiguous openness of existence.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgsm8_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rgsm8_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3039,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Unlucky 13: A Narrative Inquiry into the Origins of Numeric Taboo Across Civilisations","authors":"Dinesh Deckker, Subhashini Sumanasekara","abstract":"The number 13 is widely regarded as unlucky in many Western societies, yet its symbolic meaning varies significantly across global cultures. This superstition, known as triskaidekaphobia, raises questions about the interplay between myth, cognition, and cultural transmission. This study aimed to investigate the origins, evolution, and cross-cultural symbolism of the number 13, exploring how it has been constructed as a taboo or sacred number across different civilisations and religious systems. Adopting a qualitative narrative inquiry and comparative analysis approach, the study synthesised data from religious texts, mythologies, historical documents, scholarly literature, and architectural practices. Theoretical frameworks from symbolic anthropology, cognitive psychology, and sociology guided the interpretation of the data. Findings reveal that the fear of 13 is not universal but culturally contingent. In Christian and Norse traditions, it is associated with betrayal and cosmic disruption; in Ancient Egyptian, Hindu, and Maya cultures, it symbolises spiritual transformation and cosmic order. The modern institutionalisation of the taboo in Western architecture and media reflects the power of narrative and collective belief over objective reasoning. The number 13 functions as a symbolic threshold—its meaning derived from narrative structure, cultural boundaries, and cognitive heuristics. This study underscores the importance of viewing numeric taboos as culturally produced phenomena rather than inherent superstitions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s3drq_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/s3drq_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4097,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Gender Representation in Indonesian YouTube Ads 2024: Analysis of Commercial Ad Content","authors":"Abraham Unais","abstract":"This study examines how gender representation is portrayed in several Indonesian commercial advertisements aired on YouTube throughout 2024. Using a qualitative content analysis approach, this study examines how gender roles are constructed and conveyed through visual and narrative elements in digital advertisements. The main objective of this research is to understand the extent to which gender stereotypes still appear and are reproduced in new media, as well as to identify any changes or consistency in these representation patterns within the Indonesian cultural context. The analysis results indicate that women are still frequently depicted in roles related to the domestic sphere, emotions, and aesthetics. Meanwhile, men are more often portrayed as rational, dominant, and masculine figures. These patterns indicate that traditional representations of gender roles persist, even in digital media platforms often perceived as modern and progressive, such as YouTube. In other words, despite changes in the platform, the social messages conveyed tend to uphold traditional norms. These findings contribute significantly to media sociology and gender studies in Indonesia, while also serving as a reminder of the need for critical evaluation of the digital content consumed by society. This research also underscores the urgency for the advertising industry to adopt more equitable, inclusive communication strategies that reflect the diversity of gender roles in contemporary society.

The Philippine context reveals a gap in recent research delving into how demographic elements impact consumer attitudes and actions associated with nutrition labeling, thus emphasizing the necessity for a localized exploration of this topic. This study explored consumers' buying behavior towards nutritional labels and health claims. It aimed to determine the relationship between consumers' demographic characteristics and their understanding and utilization of nutritional facts when making food purchases. A descriptive-correlational design was utilized. A structured questionnaire was administered to 184 respondents from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds. The instrument collected data on age, sex, educational attainment, monthly income, perceptions of nutrition labels, and label usage behavior. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to analyze the data. Research revealed that health-conscious and budget-conscious consumers were inclined to scrutinize nutrition labels and health claims when selecting food items. Their priorities leaned towards nutritional value and affordability. Conversely, trend followers and convenience seekers paid less attention to nutritional information, tending to make decisions based on taste, brand familiarity, or convenience. The study shows a positive correlation between higher levels of education, increased monthly income, and favorable perceptions and frequent use of nutrition labels. These findings emphasize the significance of embracing consumer diversity in shaping effective nutrition communication strategies. By grasping the intricate behaviors unique to each consumer group, stakeholders can devise tailored interventions, empowering the population with enhanced nutritional knowledge and more conscious dietary decisions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z5w6p_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/z5w6p_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3806,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Capital Conversion and the Formal–Informal Divide: Structural Poverty in Dutch Cities","authors":"Floris Noordhoff","abstract":"This article investigates how structurally poor urban residents in the Netherlands endeavour to convert limited economic, social and cultural capital into labour-market positions, and why formal routes fail while informal ones partially succeed. Drawing on Bourdieu’s concepts of capital, field, conversion and symbolic violence, we analyse 216 qualitative interviews from Amsterdam-Noord, Rotterdam-Delfshaven and Amsterdam-Bijlmermeer (1997–1999). An abductive thematic coding reveals that, in the formal field, participants encounter multiple barriers: insufficient finances preclude investment in education; welfare regulations penalise training; and low-paid “subsidised” jobs carry heavy stigma and minimal financial gain. In contrast, the informal economy permits partial “conversion” of under-utilised capital via trust-based networks and norms of reciprocity. Acquaintance ties enable odd jobs and self-provisioning, yielding predictable (unreported) incomes while preserving benefits. Yet informal work is illegal, precarious—subject to sanctions and irregular hours—and morally contested by some respondents. Crucially, even precarious informal work sustains dignity and self-worth, whereas formal options are either inaccessible or perceived as demeaning. We theorise these dynamics through Bourdieu’s notion of conversion capacity—the field-specific ability to transform one form of capital into another—and demonstrate that structural inequalities operate through symbolic misrecognition and field-specific logics. Formal fields impose conversion barriers and symbolic violence, devaluing the poor, while informal fields allow limited capital exchange on moral terms. Policy implications include the need to reconceive conversion capacity as relational and field-specific, shifting attention from individual deficits to structural constraints.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5jcrz_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/5jcrz_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5183,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Social Capital and Upward Mobility: Insights from Spatial Analysis of Economic Opportunity in the U.S.","authors":"Alejandra Rodríguez-Sánchez","abstract":"Chetty et al.

Building on their work, this study reexamines that assumption by applying geographically weighted regression (GWR) to the same datasets. GWR enables coefficients to vary by location, uncovering spatial heterogeneity in the association between economic connectedness and mobility. Our findings reveal considerable regional variation: while strong positive associations are evident in areas like the Northern Plains, weaker or even slightly negative relationships emerge in the South and along the East and West coasts.

We find that compliance is frequently experienced as humiliation, leading claimants to withdraw, self-exclude, and suffer relational disempowerment. Bureaucratic practices—through street-level discretion, compliance regimes, and exclusion—impose a demeaning “undeserving” identity on clients. This symbolic violence undermines claimants’ self-worth, discourages benefit take-up, and strains their relationship with the state. The article advances social policy theory by linking welfare compliance struggles to Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic violence and highlights the need for policy reforms to mitigate stigma and empower welfare recipients.

Intervention-induced changes in the social networks of people living with dementia","authors":"Doris Gebhard, Jan Ellinger","abstract":"This is a preprint that has not yet been peer-reviewed. For most people living with dementia, their social network shrinks as the disease progresses, especially when they move into a care home. Many experience major barriers to build social relationships in the new living environment and additionally there is a lack of effective interventions to promote social contacts between residents. Considering this, the aim of the present study is twofold: (1) to investigate the effect of two interventions (physical activity [PA] vs. PA plus social component [PAS]) on the social networks of people living with dementia in long-term care facilities using an ordinal mixed-effects model, and (2) to identify the participants who benefit most from these interventions through descriptive profile analysis. Sociocentric networks of the intervention groups were assessed before and after the respective 12-week interventions. Photographs served as a facilitative tool, enabling participants to identify their social contacts and evaluate the quality of these relationships, categorizing them as positive regard, casual friend, or true friend. Loneliness, the importance of friendships within the facility and the attitude towards peer residents were assessed in interviews. 46 people living with dementia (87.1±7.3 years, 82.6% female) from six care homes participated in the interventions. In five out of six social networks, both graph density and weighted graph density increased. The average graph density across the PA groups increased by 14.8% and by 153.3% in the PAS groups. The results of the ordinal regression analysis confirm a significant positive time effect across both intervention types (β = 2.29, 95% CI = [1.36; 3.86]) as well as for each intervention type separately. Evident interaction effects (β = 5.76, 95% CI = [2.87; 11.57]) indicate that the time effect in the PAS groups (β = 10.68, 95% CI = [6.11; 18.69]) was significantly higher than in the PA groups (β = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.47; 4.63]). The profile analysis indicates that a higher level of cognitive functioning in particular contributes to greater benefit. The observed results fit in well with the current state of research and at the same time underline the benefits and necessity of using social network analysis approaches in research with people living with dementia in the long-term care setting.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9nv3c_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9nv3c_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4171,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Who polices which boundaries?

Users may imitate AI outputs, converge prematurely, or misinterpret confidence as understanding—producing brittle knowledge loops that collapse under scrutiny. This paper introduces a dual-friction framework to address these risks. The Memetic Design Loop models how mimetic desire and semantic drift unfold across human–AI exchanges, highlighting the cognitive vulnerabilities induced by fast, confident AI. To counteract this, we propose design interventions that embed intentional slowness, divergence, and reflective scaffolding into AI-mediated reasoning environments. Drawing from epistemic friction theory, mimetic philosophy, and regenerative design principles, we present a methodology that resists premature closure by foregrounding attentional rhythm, deliberative pause, and conceptual variation. We also offer a two-layered evaluative lens focused not on performance, but on epistemic resilience: the system’s capacity to sustain plurality, preserve semantic coherence, and foster reflective trust. AI systems do not merely process information—they shape the cognitive environments in which decisions are made, beliefs are formed, and knowledge is legitimized. As such, they must be studied not only as technical tools, but as socio-technical systems: assemblages of algorithms, interfaces, cultural norms, institutional logics, and human desires. This paper contributes to an interdisciplinary discourse at the intersection of design theory, epistemology, and social science by articulating how AI interfaces co-produce epistemic authority, and how design choices encode political, ethical, and cognitive consequences. We position friction not just as a technical affordance, but as a cultural and epistemic intervention—opening space for dissent, pluralism, and attentional agency in systems increasingly optimized for speed and conformity. In doing so, the work aligns with ongoing debates in science and technology studies (STS), critical AI ethics, and the sociology of knowledge infrastructures, offering both a critique and a design philosophy for preserving epistemic sovereignty in AI-augmented societies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f9e65_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/f9e65_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4185,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Advancing Healthcare Sustainability Through Integrated Triple Bottom Line Implementation: A Comprehensive Framework for Economic Prosperity, Environmental Quality, and Social Equity","authors":"Amin A.

Starting from the premise that, given earlier performance, it would be rational to go on to the highest possible track to avoid downward mobility, the Dutch early-tracking system assumes that students oversee a long educational future to optimize their educational investment.

Granovetter’s classic theory of the “strength of weak ties” posits that weak, bridge‐like ties can connect disadvantaged individuals to new opportunities, yet evidence from impoverished contexts suggests these ties often fail to deliver leverage. This article revisits the weak ties hypothesis in the context of long-term poverty in the Netherlands. Drawing on 216 in-depth interviews with low-income residents of urban neighbourhoods, we examine how social capital operates under conditions of scarcity and constraint. The findings reveal three interrelated dynamics that undermine the potential benefits of weak ties. First, dilemmas of honour and status lead people to avoid exploiting social connections for material gain, as they prioritise dignity and reciprocity norms over opportunism. Second, reciprocity expectations and the work of time show that unmet obligations and temporal lags in exchange erode trust, causing initially supportive ties to wither. Third, risk assessment and the cost of connection highlight how uncertainty and negative past experiences make individuals wary of new or distant contacts. Together, these factors constrain the usefulness of weak ties for getting ahead, even when such ties are present. We discuss how these findings refine social capital theory by illuminating the social processes that temper the “strength” of weak ties in persistently poor communities. Policy efforts to reduce poverty by “building bridges” must account for the contextually rooted norms of honour, reciprocity, and trust that condition network behaviour.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jz9nk_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/jz9nk_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5397,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Markets of Trust: Moral Economy and Social Control in the Urban Informal Economy","authors":"Floris Noordhoff","abstract":"Informal economic practices are often portrayed as opportunistic or normless, especially in contexts of urban poverty.

These dynamics create boundaries between acceptable help, fair trade, and illegitimate hustling. While trust and informal surveillance foster accountability and solidarity, they also produce exclusionary hierarchies, gendered obligations, and moral tension. Rather than a retreat from norms, informal economies represent a contested moral field where individuals navigate the pressures of scarcity, dignity, and community judgement.

The investigation proceeds through systematic analysis of Jaspers' theoretical architecture, demonstrating how recent developments in collective phenomenology, postphenomenological technology studies, and cross-cultural methodology transform his originally individualistic framework into a sophisticated resource for contemporary interdisciplinary scholarship. Drawing upon Margaret Gilbert's joint commitment theory, Dan Zahavi's collective intentionality research, and Kwok-ying Lau's double epoché method, the study reveals how boundary situations manifest collectively whilst maintaining existential authenticity. Critical engagement with feminist, postcolonial, and Indigenous perspectives illuminates both the enduring significance and necessary limitations of Jaspers' framework, whilst Peter-Paul Verbeek's technological mediation theory and Yuk Hui's cosmotechnics provide resources for addressing artificial intelligence ethics and digital transformation. Clinical applications through phenomenological assessment tools demonstrate the continued vitality of Jaspersian approaches in contemporary psychiatric practice, whilst environmental applications reveal how climate crisis constitutes a species-level boundary situation demanding collective existential response. The article concludes that whilst Jaspers' epistemology requires critical reconstruction to address issues of power, social positioning, and ontological pluralism, his fundamental insight regarding the confrontation with limits as generative of authentic knowledge remains indispensable for navigating contemporary boundary situations, now understood as irreducibly collective phenomena requiring cross-cultural dialogue and technological wisdom. **Keywords:** Karl Jaspers, epistemology, boundary situations, collective transcendence, phenomenological psychiatry, methodological pluralism, existential philosophy, artificial intelligence ethics, environmental philosophy, cross-cultural dialogue, postphenomenology, cosmotechnics","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmaf9_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/pmaf9_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4161,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Мандрівництво у східнослов'янській культурі","authors":"Olexii Varypaiev","abstract":"This dissertation presents a comprehensive philosophical and cultural analysis of the phenomenon of pilgrimage (mandrivnytstvo) in East Slavic culture. It traces the evolution of this concept from a widespread form of folk religious life in the 10th–19th centuries to a subject of philosophical reflection in the 19th and 20th centuries. The research identifies key archetypes such as the kalika perekhodyi and the “wandering monk,” linking them with deep-rooted spatial and eschatological metaphors that shaped national mentalities. A central focus is placed on the Ukrainian line of pilgrimage thought, particularly embodied in the works and life of philosopher Hryhorii Skovoroda and later echoed by Mykola Hohol. Their contributions helped elevate pilgrimage from popular custom to a symbol of spiritual quest and national cultural identity. The work also explores the cultural opposition between “pilgrimage” and “wandering” (as estrangement), which became central to philosophical and literary discourse during the Russian Silver Age. This binary is examined through the writings of N. Berdyaev, S. Bulgakov, and others, highlighting pilgrimage as a moral and ontological category. In the postmodern era, pilgrimage is reinterpreted as a metaphor for virtual movement, identity search, and cultural decoding in a digitized world. The study concludes that pilgrimage remains a vital concept for understanding East Slavic spirituality, national identity, and the transformation of cultural narratives.

У роботі простежується еволюція цього поняття — від поширеної форми народного релігійного життя в Х–XIX століттях до предмета філософського осмислення в XIX–XX століттях. Дослідження виокремлює ключові архетипи, такі як каліка перехожий і «мандрівний чернець», пов’язуючи їх із глибоко вкоріненими просторовими та есхатологічними метафорами, що формували національні ментальності. Особливу увагу приділено українській лінії паломницької думки, зокрема, втіленій у житті та творчості філософа Григорія Сковороди та пізніше відбитій у творчості Миколи Гоголя. Їхній внесок сприяв піднесенню паломництва від народного звичаю до символу духовного пошуку та національної культурної ідентичності. У роботі також розглянуто культурну опозицію між «паломництвом» і «блуканням» (як відчуженням), яка стала центральною для філософського та літературного дискурсу доби Срібного віку в Росії. Ця бінарність аналізується через твори М. Бердяєва, С. Булгакова та інших, де паломництво постає як моральна й онтологічна категорія. У постмодерну епоху паломництво переосмислюється як метафора віртуального руху, пошуку ідентичності та культурного декодування в оцифрованому світі. Дослідження доходить висновку, що паломництво залишається життєздатним поняттям для розуміння східнослов’янської духовності, національної ідентичності та трансформації культурних наративів.

The literature on money in politics debates whether \"small\" individual campaign donors are more ideologically extreme than large donors. This paper reverses the question, investigating whether extreme candidates request smaller contributions from potential donors. Using data from U.S. congressional candidates' fundraising platforms in the 2020 elections, I examine how campaigns typically present a set of suggested donation amounts to solicit money from potential donors efficiently. While party, in-state income levels, and the usage of major fundraising platforms mattered, ideological extremism had no bearing on the amounts candidates asked for. Given that solicitation amounts have been long and easily optimized through A/B testing, I interpret this as extreme candidates not finding it profitable to ask for smaller amounts, which is more aligned with the view that small donors are not more ideologically extreme than large donors.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s537q_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/s537q_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4319,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Mentoring Relationships among Low-SES Youth in Singapore: Barriers, Enablers, and the Role of Social Capital","authors":"Nilanjan Raghunath, Vincent Chua","abstract":"Mentoring is widely recognized as a catalyst for upward social mobility among youth from low socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds. However, relatively little is known about how disadvantaged youth negotiate and experience effective mentoring relationships in practice. This study addresses that gap by examining the barriers and enabling factors that influence whether these young people can benefit from mentorship. The study employs a mixed-methods design, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data from Singaporean youth (ages 18–25) residing in public housing. This paper reports the qualitative results of the study, while the quantitative results are reported in a different paper published in a journal. The analysis explores personal narratives to illuminate the interplay of factors that shape access to mentoring relationships and the potential of these relationships to improve the life outcomes of low-SES youths. The findings indicate that low-SES youth in Singapore rely heavily on family and peer networks for guidance in decision-making, yet struggle to engage in formal mentoring relationships that provide practical, relevant support aligned with their aspirations and needs. These results underscore the importance of applying a social capital lens to mentorship initiatives, integrating them with youths’ existing support systems to ensure that guidance is meaningful for their upward mobility.

Exploring the intersections of masculinities, football, and gambling","authors":"Christopher Bunn, Gerda Reith, Blair Biggar, Heather Wardle","abstract":"In the digital age, gambling has evolved from traditional physical spaces to virtual platforms easily accessible via smartphones. This shift has significantly impacted the gambling industry's profits, particularly in sports betting, which is heavily intertwined with football. Gambling companies have strategically aligned their products with masculinity and football fandom, fostering what some call the \"gamblification\" of football culture. In this climate, research has highlighted the multitude of harms associated with gambling, especially among vulnerable groups like young men. Public health interventions, such as the Football Fans in Training (FFIT) program, have leveraged the cultural significance of football clubs to promote healthy lifestyles and behaviour change. We carried out research that aimed to adapt this kind of intervention to address gambling harm among men through a programme we named Football Fans and Betting (FFAB). However, despite its intentions, FFAB faced a number of challenges related to the normalization of gambling within football environments and the stigma associated with seeking help for gambling problems. This paper examines the intersection of masculinity, football, and gambling harm prevention through the lens of the FFAB program. It suggests that disrupting the harmful relationship between gambling, sports, and masculinity requires contesting entrenched cultural norms and industry practices. It calls for tighter regulatory control, challenging responsible gambling discourse, and creating discursive spaces where men can address gambling harm without stigma. By reframing gambling harm as a systemic issue, attention can be redirected toward industry accountability and the creation of safer environments for vulnerable individuals.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wtqrd_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/wtqrd_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3949,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Address Challenges Markowitz (1952) Faces: A New Measure of Asset Risk","authors":"George Y. Nie","abstract":"Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, we argue that asset risk approaches zero as distance approaches zero, and that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address the challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former while following a lognormal distribution with the risk noise following a normal distribution). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. We show that equity price is the present value of a spanning bond, a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option is an equity bond whose price minus the present value mirrors the overcharge or transaction cost. Our examples show how to compute debt and equity risk. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, thereby redefining firm misevaluation theory.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xa7k8_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/xa7k8_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3287,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Do Conspicuous Consumption Motives Explain Eco Friendly Consumption Decisions? Evidence from Social Media Exposure Effects","authors":"Senyo Obed Amponsah, Yoonjae Lee","abstract":"While past research suggests that conspicuous consumption does not support the goals of sustainable consumer behavior, emerging evidence indicates that it can drive green product choices in online contexts. However, the online mechanisms that support this process remain unclear. This study employs a Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling approach to examine how conspicuous consumption motives influence green purchase intentions when consumers are exposed to green content on social media. It hypothesizes that social media exposure, Fear of Missing Out (FOMO), and social comparison act as antecedents to green conspicuous consumption motives, with perceived quality moderating these relationships. Data was collected from 346 social media users in the U.S., U.K., and Canada. Results indicate that conspicuous consumption motives significantly mediate the relationship between FOMO, social comparison, and green purchase intentions. While perceived quality enhances the effect of social comparison on conspicuous consumption, it does not significantly impact the relationship between FOMO and conspicuous consumption. These findings highlight the role of social media in shaping green purchase decisions and suggest that businesses and policymakers can leverage conspicuous consumption motives to promote sustainable consumer behavior. By positioning green products as both environmentally responsible and status-enhancing, marketers can appeal to consumers’ desire for social validation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5n6wg_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/5n6wg_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4163,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools for Academic Activities by Undergraduate Students: A Quantitative Study at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) Library","authors":"Sandun Chamara Weerasinghe, H.

Out of the population, 100 students were selected as the sample using the convenience sampling method. The quantitative research design was employed in the study. The survey method was used to collect data from the selected sample. A structured questionnaire was used as a data collection instrument. Frequency counts and simple percentages were used to analyze the collected data. According to the study, 99% of undergraduate students used AI tools for academic activities. The most frequently used AI tool is ChatGPT (94%), followed by Quill bot and Grammarly. Students use AI tools to check grammatical errors (73%), enhance subject knowledge (68%), and summarize content (67%). Fifty-two percent (52%) of students think using AI diminishes critical thinking, but most disagree that using AI is cheating. Ninety percent (90%) of students claim to know how to use AI ethically. It is recommended that access to proper language editing tools should be offered, as students rely on ChatGPT for grammar correction. Emphasizing the importance of using reputed publications when enhancing students' subject knowledge, raising awareness about library e-resources, and creating AI usage policies collaboratively with faculties would also be an appropriate intervention.

Analysis of customer and publisher press release statements","authors":"Mikael Laakso, Philips Ayeni","abstract":"How open access (OA) should be supported has been a frequent point of debate during the last three decades as different pathways have been created and evolved. One particular point of contention has been the use of institutional contracts between customer institutions and academic journal publishers, so-called transformative agreements (TAs), where subscription-based reading access is bundled with OA publishing rights. This study explores the motivational reasonings given by customers and publishers engaging with TAs. This study provides a thematic content analysis of customer and publisher statements from 95 press releases announcing new TAs involving five large scholarly journal publishers. Existing literature on motivational reasoning for open science, OA, and TAs was reviewed in order to create an initial set of codes to be used, which was complemented with an inductive process producing additional codes based on categorisation of reasonings that did not fit within the initial codes.The study found that TAs were supported for a variety of reasons, where both customers and publishers stressed better research dissemination, facilitating a transition towards OA publishing, and improved workflow management for publishing and invoicing. Customers emphasized economic and equality aspects while publishers did so to a notably lesser degree. This study complements the active area of bibliometric studies on TAs with a rich qualitative study based on a set of press releases that have not been used for this type of research, establishing a solid foundation for future studies to build upon.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/crxn3_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/crxn3_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3239,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Moral Development in College Students","authors":"Hyemin Han","abstract":"Researchers and educators have found that college students, who are entering young adulthood, are experiencing radical transitions to become independent individuals. Studies in moral psychology suggest that developmental changes occurring during this transitional period likely impact people’s flourishing in social and civic domains in the long term. Hence, educators working in higher education may need to understand moral development among college students well to facilitate the students’ positive youth development in their instruction and mentorship. In this chapter, I will overview theories and research findings about moral development among college students while considering their educational implications. Furthermore, I will suggest several educational strategies to promote ethical and positive development based on evidence to inform higher education instructors interested in promoting ethical development and flourishing in college students. At the beginning of the chapter, I will briefly review existing theories and empirical findings about moral development in various functional domains during late adolescence and young adulthood, where most college students are situated, for readers’ information. First, the classical theory of moral development focusing on moral judgment and reasoning, the (Neo-)Kohlbergian theory will be reviewed. According to this model, college students are experiencing the formation and consolidation of the postconventional schema, which is required for a sophisticated moral judgment to deal with complicated socio-moral issues. Second, I will examine recent advances in research on moral development during young adulthood that approach ethical development and functioning as multifaceted phenomena. These will include studies on positive youth development in moral domains (e.g., civic purpose development involving concerns on the beyond-the-self beings) and practical wisdom (phronesis) development. These novel research findings will provide integrative and comprehensive theoretical models of ethical functioning and development in college students. Given the classical developmental model could not completely address the gap between judgment and behavior, the up-to-date theories mentioned above will shed light on understanding the mechanism of ethical motivation and behavior for improving education. In the next part of the chapter, I will suggest several practical guidelines for instructors in higher education who intend to promote their students’ moral and positive development based on multidisciplinary research in moral psychology, philosophy, neuroscience, and computer science (particularly artificial intelligence research). I will focus on the role of instructors as students’ moral models and mentors assisting in exploring and expanding their ethical horizons and implementing learned morals and virtues into action in diverse situations and contexts. Findings from multidisciplinary research will be overviewed to support the necessity of the modeling and mentoring approach in ethics education in higher education. Furthermore, several instructional strategies to boost the effectiveness of the modeling and mentoring-based approach will be introduced along with supporting evidence from empirical studies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cx9bp_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/cx9bp_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3367,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Lost in Translation: Evaluating the Performance of Five Publicly Available Machine-Translators for Luganda-English Interpretation","authors":"Rick Mwebaza","abstract":"Luganda, after English, is the most popular language in Uganda (Ssentanda and Nakayiza, 2015), boasting over 20 million speakers across the globe in 2021 (New Vision, 2021).

In a survey experiment (N = 3,868), universalist values predicted agreement with all climate mitigation appeals regardless of framing, while particularist values predicted disagreement with all but one appeal. This appeal, focusing on national interests and respect for local communities, resonated strongly with particularists and reduced political polarization in appeal agreement, but was underrepresented in elite rhetoric relative to more divisive framings. However, moral frame exposure showed no downstream effects on broader climate attitudes.
