[{"title": "Institutional Forbearance as a Mechanism of Democratic Stability", "authors": "SEAN INGHAM", "abstract": "Some scholars argue that democratic stability requires political elites to practice forbearance : roughly speaking, “restraint in deploying their institutional prerogatives” (Levitsky and Ziblatt, How Democracies Die , 2018). The article proposes a novel conception of forbearance as a mechanism of democratic stability. According to this view, public officials exercise forbearance when they refrain from actions of uncertain legitimacy, actions that, while in fact compatible with democracy’s constitutive rules, are not commonly known to be. The argument is that such actions, by provoking divergent reactions among citizens, create uncertainty about the extent to which others are willing to resist breaches of democracy’s rules. This uncertainty undermines their ability to coordinate responses to genuine abuses of power in the future. The article concludes with observations about the normative implications of the theory, introducing the concept of the “Democrat’s Dilemma” to illustrate the difficulties of knowing when democrats ought to practice forbearance.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s000305542510124x", "doi": "10.1017/s000305542510124x", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007049435975256868}, {"title": "Demand and Supply of Criminal Governance: Experimental Evidence from Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador", "authors": "JAVIER OSORIO, SUSAN BREWER-OSORIO", "abstract": "What explains the demand and supply of criminal governance? Contrary to traditional explanations of criminal governance as top-down control, this study integrates bottom-up demands for assistance and top-down supply of aid and coercion. We argue that the demand for criminal governance stems from civilians’ drive to satisfy their primary necessities, while security concerns motivate criminals to supply governance to prevent civilian resistance. The theory focuses on three main factors: economic difficulties, articulation/resistance capacity, and government response. The empirical strategy uses multiple list experiments conducted in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. On the demand side, results indicate that economic difficulties and civilian articulation capacity shape the demand for criminal aid. On the supply side, criminals largely neglect people’s economic needs. When criminals help, they do it for cheap and to neutralize potential civilian resistance or to compete against the state.

We theorize that both the coalition negotiation context and the negotiation outcome influence citizens’ evaluations.

Like other sources of outside ideas, DLC-based ideational importation depends on the establishment of organizational infrastructure for ideological dissemination—and ideational localization—for the adaptation and translation of external ideas to the local context. Unlike other kinds of transnational ideational networks, such cooperation is primarily based on national kinship that transcends specific ideational commitments. Such national kinship, we argue, legitimizes DLC and supports multidimensional ideational importation that can potentially amount to ideological change. We further suggest that the actual ideological change this process triggers depends on how imported ideas align with core ideological components and how they serve the needs of local actors in a given political context.

This study examines how older micro-Wanghong navigate challenges during content creation, revealing critical gaps in existing digital inclusion theory. Drawing on an exploratory qualitative study of 11 micro-Wanghong, we develop the dynamic access concept that reconceptualizes digital inclusion as continuous adaptation across three dimensions: motivational resilience (maintaining creator identity despite platform constraints), adaptive skill development (ongoing competency evolution responding to platform changes), and algorithmic navigation (strategic responses to systematic platform exclusions). Our analysis reveals systematic algorithmic exclusion through temporal marginalization (algorithms favoring high-frequency posting patterns that disadvantage older micro-Wanghong’s rhythms), knowledge domain restrictions (automated content moderation limiting topics relevant to older adults), and culture misalignment (platform architectures optimized for entertainment conflicting with older micro-Wanghong’s knowledge transformation preferences) that create structural barriers independent of individual competencies. Despite these constraints, participants demonstrate sophisticated adaptive strategies enabling sustained creative participation through ongoing platform negotiation rather than static skill application. These findings extend Van Dijk’s digital inclusion theory by demonstrating how platform-mediated content creation collapses traditional access boundaries into ongoing negotiation processes. The dynamic access addresses temporal dimensions which often assumed in digital appropriation or inclusion theories, positioning meaningful participation as requiring continuous adaptive capacity rather than one-time achievement. We argue that digital inclusion policy must evolve beyond basic access provision toward supporting ongoing adaptation to platform evolution.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251386732", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251386732", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01646771561959537}, {"title": "How do Healthy Political Discussions Invigorate Online Participation?

While previous research has primarily focused on digital news production and platformization in Western contexts, this study offers a transnational and sociotechnical perspective on how Chinese journalists negotiate platform logics (such as audience metrics and recommendation algorithms) while balancing state-driven narratives with global audience demands. Drawing on 26 in-depth interviews, the study zooms in on Chinese journalists’ constrained freedom associated with social media use: they benefit from access to large audiences but lack control over platform design and governance. These Chinese journalists often feel alienated from the platforms they rely on: journalistic labor is regulated by the Chinese state, while platform infrastructures are governed by U.S. tech firms. This study highlights how platformization in transnational journalism is shaped by the entanglement of technology, politics, and professional norms, extending our understanding of how platform power operates across geopolitical boundaries and offering a distinctive lens on the global unevenness of digital media systems.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251378989", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251378989", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004829446241117363}, {"title": "Mediated Peer Interactions Among Rural Children in China: A Field Study From the Perspective of the New Sociology of Childhood", "authors": "Hongli Zhou, Xudong Zhou, Jing Wang", "abstract": "Amid the profound transformations of rural society, traditional authorities and value systems are undergoing significant disruption. Mediated peer interactions among children are no longer merely a form of entertainment, but have become crucial arenas where they exercise agency and participate in shaping these changes. Grounded in the theoretical framework of the new sociology of childhood, this study presents an ethnographic investigation of HL Village. The findings reveal that the official evaluative system, represented by the school, has lost its effectiveness within the peer world. As active social agents, children reconstruct interactional spaces, reinvent social rules, and generate internal hierarchies through intensive mediated peer communication. In doing so, they establish an alternative value system centered on “media capital.” This dynamic creates a fundamental tension between the disciplinary logic of the adult world and the reconstructive logic of children’s peer culture. Based on these findings, the study argues that the agency children exhibit in mediated peer interactions is deeply ambivalent: while it challenges traditional authority, it simultaneously reproduces new forms of inequality and digital exclusion. Moreover, this mediated peer interactions offers a micro-level lens through which to observe rural social transformation, as its unique culture of interaction both reflects and contributes to broader structural shifts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251386730", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251386730", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009549307645780547}, {"title": "ICT payoffs for workers: Evidence from the labor market in Brazil", "authors": "Flavia Alves", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103081", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103081", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03760782137233287}, {"title": "Why (not) talk about human rights?

Third, the fiscal consolidation leads voters to be less dissatisfied with their local government and increases the probability of re-election for the incumbent party.

First, to reduce aggregate water demand, the public utility increased prices, leading to large demand reductions by richer households. Prior to the drought they use twice the public piped water of poorer households. At the peak of the drought, they use less. Second, some of the differential demand reduction comes from richer households substituting away from public water toward privately financed groundwater. This private adaptation both lowers the public utility’s total revenue and shifts costs onto poorer households, consequences that persist after the drought abates.

Our analysis draws on administrative data from a Chinese university covering three student cohorts over four years. We exploit random roommate assignments, differential exposure to a policy shock (gaming restrictions for minors), and differential exposure to a discrete event (the introduction of a blockbuster video game) for identification. App usage is contagious: a one s.d. increase in roommates’ in-college app usage raises own usage by 5.8%. High app usage is harmful across all measured outcomes. A one s.d. increase in app usage reduces GPAs by 36.2% of a within-cohort-major s.d. and lowers wages by 2.3%. Roommates’ app usage reduces a student’s GPAs and wages through both disruptions and behavioral spillovers, generating a total negative effect that exceeds half the magnitude of the impact from the student’s own app usage. Extending China’s three-hour-per-week gaming restriction for minors to college students would boost their initial wages by 0.9%.

Should governments expect large-scale emigration, as ongoing urbanization increases people's aspirations and capabilities to move? We analyze rates of emigration (i.e., movements crossing national borders) from different tiers of the urban hierarchy observed in 40 developing countries spanning the entire spectrum of urbanization. Estimates are obtained by demographic analysis of population censuses fielded between 1970 and 2017. Remote sensing products ensure an internationally consistent definition of cities. Statistical modelling is used to summarize global trends in emigration over the course of urbanization. Results reveal that the propensity to move abroad diffuses down the urban hierarchy. In early stages of urbanization, emigration rates are highest in cities, especially in the largest ones, but subsequently decline. Rural areas exhibit a lagged increase in emigration, first in more densely populated settlements, in the cities’ hinterlands and border areas, and eventually in the sparsely populated and remote countryside. In late stages of urbanization, rural emigration tends to plateau or increase again. There is evidence of a decline only in the remote countryside. Yet the rural rates of emigration remain consistently below the peak levels observed in cities. We interpret these findings with reference to the subnational diffusion of development and discuss implications for international migration and urbanization trends in developing countries.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251384588", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251384588", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9909116673514743}, {"title": "Book Review: Decided Return Migration: Emotions, Citizenship, Home and Belonging in Bosnia and Herzegovina by Aida Ibričević IbričevićAida. 2024.

Indeed, examining disparities in SWB between Italian and foreign citizens is crucial for understanding if their well‐being levels are similar and which factors might either foster or hinder parity. Italy is a peculiar case study, as it is characterized by a general lack of trust in institutions; moreover, the relationship between SWB and institutional trust has so far not been approached from a native/immigrant comparative perspective. We use pooled data from seven rounds (2015–2021) of the Multipurpose survey on households ‘Aspects of Daily Life’ carried out by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT). Our dependent variable is self‐reported life satisfaction. Institutional trust is built as an index of respondent's trust in the Italian parliament, the government, political parties, the judicial system and law enforcement. We run OLS linear regression models with wave fixed effects to account for changes in the distribution between the different years. Life satisfaction is slightly higher for Italians compared to foreign citizens. Institutional trust appears positive and a significant predictor of life satisfaction for both Italian and foreign citizens. However, results suggest that institutional trust has a mediating role for the life satisfaction of foreign citizens, meaning that trust in institutions is more important for non‐Italian citizens. Finally, government change is positively associated with life satisfaction.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70120", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70120", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.026679125637311563}, {"title": "From Flux to Capital: Distinguishing Patterns of Income and Wealth Segregation in the Netherlands", "authors": "Javier San Millán, Clémentine Cottineau‐Mugadza, Maarten Van Ham", "abstract": "Who are “the rich” and how should their residential patterns be studied? In society, the rich are defined not only by their high income but also—and perhaps more importantly—by their high wealth. However, while income is closely monitored and taxed, wealth often remains less scrutinised, particularly in the context of residential segregation research. This study explores how the spatial patterns of affluence and poverty differ when considering wealth versus income and discusses their implications. By analyzing geo‐coded microdata from the Netherlands, we reveal that wealth segregation is much higher than income segregation, and that roughly the top tenth richest households in terms of wealth are far more spatially isolated from the rest of the population than what the income‐based literature would suggest. Our findings also demonstrate three other key insights: (1) Whereas financial wealth is more unequally distributed than real estate wealth across society , it is more equally distributed across space . (2) Wealth segregation is notably more sensitive to the spatial scale of measurement compared to income segregation. (3) The temporal trends of income and wealth segregation diverge: while the former is decreasing in most urban areas, wealth segregation is rising almost everywhere in the Netherlands. This stresses the necessity of incorporating wealth into studies of segregation not as an alternative operationalization, but as a different perspective on the spatial concentration of capital which captures the role of social class, age and migration in a way that income‐based approaches cannot render.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70127", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70127", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.028263202008850352}, {"title": "Infrastructures of Highly Skilled Family Migration: Political Economy of the Family in Migration", "authors": "Sophie Cranston, George Tan", "abstract": "Research on highly skilled migration has challenged methodological individualism by emphasising the need to centre familial relationships in the understanding of migration.

Drawing on a sample of 413 elderly migrants from two representative migrant‐concentrated districts in Shenzhen, China, this study employed structural equation modelling to investigate the pathways linking residential normalcy, place attachment, and mental well‐being. The key findings reveal that place attachment serves as a significant mediator in the relationship between residential normalcy and mental well‐being, with place identity emerging as the most prominent subcomponent. This relationship is further moderated by both the duration of residence and the quality of the residential environment. Specifically, residential normalcy exerts a direct positive effect on mental well‐being only among elderly migrants residing in high‐quality neighbourhoods, indicating that residential mastery directly enhances their mental well‐being. Furthermore, for late‐life arrivals and elderly migrants living in lower‐quality neighbourhoods, the development of place attachment through residential mastery proves challenging. In these groups, the mediating influence of place identity assumes greater importance relative to their counterparts. The study demonstrates that fostering place attachment can serve as a critical affective coping strategy for mitigating mental well‐being challenges associated with ageing out of place. Therefore, there is a critical need for the development and implementation of policies and interventions aimed at fostering residential normalcy and enhancing place attachment, especially among late‐life arrivals and elderly migrants residing in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Such measures are essential to support the transition from ‘ageing out of place’ to healthy ‘ageing in place’ for elderly migrants in urban China.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70129", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70129", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9862463703983352}, {"title": "Attention on social media depends more on how you express yourself than on who you are", "authors": "Yizhang Zhao, Tianyu Qiao, Yirao Chen, Meiying Kuang, Wei Bai, Yankun Yi, Xinxin Huang, Wen Li, Weidong Wang", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02323-1", "doi": "10.1038/s41562-025-02323-1", "journal_full": "Nature Human Behaviour", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.023848622057743962}, {"title": "Beyond adoption: The persistence of conservation and climate-smart agricultural practices in the United States", "authors": "Paul J.

First, how have Americans’ political discussion networks changed over the past 25 y? Second, are the consequences of these changes what one would expect based on previous theory linking Americans’ interpersonal information environments to political tolerance and political participation? I resolve competing claims suggesting that people feel less free to discuss politics, with claims suggesting instead that political discussion now permeates everyday life to a greater extent than in the past. Findings suggest widespread increases in political discussion, changes driven almost entirely by increases in like-minded political discussion partners. Surprisingly, Americans are no more or less likely to engage in conversations across lines of political difference. The predicted consequences of these fluctuations confirm an intrinsic tension between characteristics valued in democratic citizens. Political tolerance has declined significantly, along with decreased awareness of rationales for others’ relative to one’s own views.

The Montessori model is longstanding but lacks rigorous impact studies; prior random lottery studies included just one or two schools, among other compromises. Here, we report on end-of-kindergarten (age 5 to 6) impacts from a national study of public Montessori preschool. We compared children offered a Montessori seat via competitive lottery admission processes at one of 24 public Montessori schools at age 3 ( n = 242 ) to children not offered a seat ( n = 346 ), estimating Montessori impacts with intention-to-treat and complier average causal effect models. Roughly half of the treatment sample still attended Montessori for kindergarten. Although there were no notable impacts at the end of PK3 or PK4, at the end of kindergarten, controlling for baseline scores and demographics, Montessori children had significantly higher reading, short-term memory, theory of mind, and executive function scores. Intention-to-treat effect sizes exceeded a fifth of a SD, considered large in field-based school research [M. A. Kraft, Educ. Res. 49 , 241–253 (2020)]. This contrasts sharply with the more typical finding, where impacts of preschool are observed immediately following the program but disappear by the end of kindergarten. Further, a cost analysis suggested three years of public Montessori preschool costs less per child than traditional programs, largely due to Montessori having higher child:teacher ratios in PK3 and PK4.

We test each stage of this theory using quasi-experimental methods on 133 matched local government units and data from the Local Government Ombudsman in England. We show that councils that are notified of maladministration in their social care provision significantly increase leadership attention and control efforts toward this service, and invest more in its core staffing, compared with a matched sample of unnotified councils. On average, the rate of maladministration falls by more than half; though, as predicted, we detect no wider performance gains.

Normalization is an emotion management strategy. It casts defensive reactions as an expected and explainable part of accountability processes.

Civil society research has tended to ignore ‘uncivil’ society and has instead focused on social capital and cohesion. Research on the noninstitutional side of the far right has been growing but has largely neglected the consequences for established civil society organizations and their members. This article addresses these blind spots by providing a conceptual framework and a methodology for studying the far right in civil society, which is applied to a case study. First, we construct a conceptual framework that adapts the contentious politics paradigm to the study of civil society. We delineate far-right contention within civil society and construct typologies of the action repertoires, actors, and targets. Second, we develop a methodology that combines different lenses to expand our view on far-right contention in civil society. We propose a mixed-methods research design for mapping far-right contentious events. Third, we apply our conceptual framework and methodology to the case of Germany by empirically mapping the action repertoires, actors and targets.

We test this theory by analyzing a unique, comprehensive dataset of discriminatory policies at 526 Christian colleges and universities in the United States, a set of organizations that has routinely been exempted from federal non-discrimination policies.

It integrates insights from the structural history of the Annales School, the heuristic use of concepts from depth psychology, and findings from evolutionary psychology to posit that a society operates on three interconnected levels: a rapidly changing socio-cultural \"Operating System\"; a deeper, intermediate layer of universal symbolic patterns, or archetypal \"BIOS\"; and a foundational \"Hardware\" of immutable biological instincts. The framework’s first stage provides a robust diagnosis of systemic instability by measuring the relationship between stress and resilience within the surface \"Operating System.\" The second, and more innovative stage, introduces the Archetypal Activation Index (AAI), a heuristic tool designed to forecast the ideological and psychological DNA of the successor state by analyzing the activation of deep symbolic patterns during a systemic \"reboot.\" The purpose of this paper is thus methodological: to propose a structured framework that shifts the focus from diagnosis to prognosis.

Currently, storage systems earn revenue by offering these grid services and through energy arbitrage—buying electricity when prices are low and selling when prices are high. However, as storage deployment expands, arbitrage profitability declines due to market saturation and narrowing price differentials (Sioshansi et al., 2009; Li et al., 2024). In ERCOT, for example, 2024 saw reduced arbitrage potential due to moderate weather and increased storage capacity. This trend underscores the need for new business models that more fully recognize and compensate the value energy storage provides to the power system. This paper presents empirical research on the full value of energy storage and proposes a commodity-market-based framework to better align compensation mechanisms with system-wide benefits. We examine hydropower as a proxy for grid-scale storage, using exogenous variation in reservoir storage volume to estimate causal effects on (1) real-time electricity prices and (2) risk premiums, measured by the day-ahead to real-time price spread, in the Northwestern United States between May 2022 and November 2024. Employing fixed-effects and lagged dependent variable models, we control for unobserved heterogeneity across balancing authorities and capture dynamic price behavior. We find that a 10% increase in reservoir storage volume reduces real-time prices by approximately 6% and lowers risk premiums by about 5%, indicating that storage mitigates short-term supply–demand imbalances. These effects are most pronounced during grid stress events, such as cold snaps, suggesting that stored energy provides significant value when the system is under strain. The results are robust to dynamic pricing effects and highlight storage’s role in reducing both price volatility and systemic risk. Overall, stored energy substantially reduces system costs and alleviates grid stress, yet most electricity markets lack mechanisms that compensate storage for these benefits. As revenue from arbitrage and grid services diminishes with increased deployment, alternative business models are needed to reward storage for its intrinsic function—potentially through the creation of a stand-alone commodity, such as stored energy itself (see the winter reserve mechanism in Switzerland). Our findings provide empirical support for developing future market frameworks that more accurately capture the risk-reducing and reliability-enhancing contributions of grid-scale energy storage.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bm5jf_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/bm5jf_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0052090747864028675}, {"title": "Parental Job Loss and Children’s Socioeconomic Disadvantage", "authors": "INVEST Flagship, Niko Eskelinen, Laura Jernström, Henri Salokangas", "abstract": "Using high-quality administrative data, we study how parental labor market shocks affect children’s socioeconomic disadvantage.

Using a within-subjects laboratory experiment, participants play two multi-period public-goods games sequentially: without and then with non-financial incentives activated by allowing for the endogenous formation of a social exclusion mechanism. This is operationalised by allowing participants, at a personal cost, to assign exclusion tickets to group members after observing their contributions: the member(s) having accumulated the most in their group gets excluded from a group activity not involving monetary payoffs nor linked to the main game.

Results show that group members who contribute relatively less receive more exclusion tickets. By imposing expected social costs on relatively low contributors, exclusion or the threat of exclusion enables groups to operate with higher contribution levels, thereby reversing the collective decline in contributions observed in the Baseline public good game. Exclusion is experienced by individuals who consistently contribute less than other group members, and this experience amplifies the effectiveness of the subsequent exclusion threat. Willingness to incur personal costs to enhance the exclusion threat increases over time and it is shaped by more cooperative normative expectations. This effect is particularly pronounced among individuals who perceive norms as tight, especially when higher contributions become more dispersed. In the absence of financial disincentives, these patterns show how non-financial incentives, shaped by more cooperative normative expectations, can foster group coordination and higher public-good contributions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j7usg_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/j7usg_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009919216814147536}, {"title": "El Consenso de Washington una revisión narrativa de su evidencia, impactos y transformaciones", "authors": "RICARDO ALONZO FERNANDEZ SALGUERO", "abstract": "El Consenso de Washington ha sido uno de los paradigmas de política económica más influyentes y controvertidos de finales del siglo XX.

Although intended to expand flexibility and align coursework with college and workforce pathways, the STEM endorsement may function as a new form of tracking. Guided by Oakes and colleagues’ work on tracking and detracking and by Domina et al.’s application of categorical inequality theory to education, this study examines which students complete a STEM endorsement and how this choice shapes college enrollment outcomes. Research Methods--We combine a content analysis of Texas college-admissions requirements with administrative data from the Houston Independent School District. Logistic and multinomial models estimate predictors of STEM endorsement completion and college choice, and nonlinear variance decomposition analyses assess how STEM–non-STEM differences in college enrollment are explained by background characteristics. Findings--The STEM endorsement aligns closely with selective college admissions. Academic factors strongly predict STEM completion, and while the endorsement is associated with enrollment at selective colleges, this relationship is largely explained by prior academic achievement. High-achieving students are more likely to pursue the STEM endorsement, which accounts for its link to selective college enrollment.

In contrast to the dominant view that rigid, well-defined boundaries maximize group rewards, I argue that ambiguity in membership criteria can, under certain conditions, more effectively secure and promote group benefits. Fuzzy boundaries are defined by two features: an intentionally ambiguous criterion for inclusion and the selective, inconsistent application of that criterion to adjust the insider-outsider line as needed. I illustrate the operation of fuzzy boundaries through a historical analysis of occupational boundary-drawing in the nineteenth-century United States. Ultimately, the study offers a generalizable framework for understanding how strategic ambiguity in group boundaries can serve actors seeking to preserve privilege across domains such as education, hiring, and professional accreditation. Unlike well-defined qualifications, the malleability of fuzzy boundaries often insulates them from legal challenge, making them an effective mechanism for maintaining social and institutional advantage. https://doi.org/10.1177/07352751251378516", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3yjs7_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/3yjs7_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010248522142609628}, {"title": "However Far Away?

Given the crucial role of social capital and informal civil society networks in crisis response and recovery, there is a pressing need for greater sociological engagement with the crisis preparedness phase as well. Incorporating literatures of sociology of disasters, civil society studies, crisis management, and disaster risk management, this paper develops an extended sociological framework that conceptualizes crisis preparedness as an inherently social process taking place at the early onset of a crisis.

Cultural alignment substitutes for formal structure when coordinative complexity is low and complements it when coordinative complexity is high.

In this paper we examine this process by studying American news media coverage of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution, a pollutant linked to premature death and cardiovascular disease. After years of decline, in 2016 PM2.5 concentrations began rising nationally in the United States, largely due to wildfires. To understand how this change has been captured in public discourse, we use frame analysis of articles in two national U.S. newspapers—the New York Times and USA Today—to trace the evolution of the social problem framing of PM2.5 from 2013 to 2024. PM2.5 was framed as a health threat and governance problem, and while 2016 marks the reversal of the nationwide trend of declining PM2.5, 2020 is the inflection point when coverage increased, and environmental justice framing became salient. We explain these changes as the consequence of a convergence of the Covid-19 pandemic, Black Lives Matter protests, major wildfires, and regulatory rollbacks that rendered PM2.5 more salient because of heightened public interest in airborne threats and growing awareness of racial inequality.

Conversely, spousal death increases the risk of immediate mortality, known as the “widowhood effect.” Although these patterns are well-documented in contemporary populations, less is understood about their prevalence in historical populations, where extended family households may have mitigated the adverse effects of being unmarried or widowed. We investigated the effects of marital status on survival probabilities from age 40 onward, focusing on socioeconomic variability. Access to resources and coping mechanisms likely differed by social class, influencing how marital status affected survival across age groups and socioeconomic strata. We analyzed historical church book data from Finland (1730–1910), applying discrete-time event models to estimate annual survival for men (n = 5,802) and women (n = 6,203) aged 40 to 90. Time-varying marital statuses were categorized into five groups: never married, married, recently widowed, widowed, and remarried. Survival differences by marital status were strongly mediated by socioeconomic status (SES). Among high-SES individuals, never-married men and women had 15% and 21% higher survival rates, respectively, compared to their married counterparts. In contrast, among the moderate and lowest socioeconomic classes, survival probabilities for the never-married did not differ from those of the married. The survival advantage of never-married women was limited to ages below 60. Both men and women experienced sharp declines in survival during the two years following spousal loss (15–27%, depending on sex and class). Beyond this acute period, widowed men exhibited 5–10% lower survival rates across all classes compared to married men, while only high-SES widowed women faced a 6% survival disadvantage. Remarriage was associated with survival rates comparable to those of first-time marriage.

To test this, I assemble a novel US employer-employee matched dataset merged with postsecondary and high school academic records. Firm placement explains much of the variation in earnings premiums between colleges. Absent firm sorting, the range of counterfactual earnings differences across colleges would fall by 56%, and over half of the earnings advantage to attending the state flagship comes from access to higher-paying employers. These sorting effects extend broadly across the distribution of high-wage firms, and not merely a handful of elite employers. Crucially, sorting effects do not simply reflect skill-based advantages, implying that college quality derives as much from institutional linkages to the labor market as from human capital development.

This scoping review analyzes 194 peer-reviewed studies to examine how risk communication strategies vary according to the temporal dimension (short-term, long-term, or hybrid), hazard types by group (atmospheric, geophysical, hydrological, and biophysi-cal), and intended purpose. Communication goals are categorized through an inductively developed approach—Act, Prepare, and Aware—and mapped across the four major hazard groups. A focused analysis of 141 studies reveals that differences, such as atmospheric hazards, are predominantly addressed through hybrid (41%) and short-term (25%) strategies, often combining real-time alerts with awareness and preparedness. Geophysical haz-ards are strongly associated with hybrid approaches (43%), which emphasize participatory and educational for-mats. Hydrological hazards display the widest variation, combining short-term, hybrid, and complex strategies. Purely long-term formats, however, are rarely found across all hazard types (1.4%), despite their strategic im-portance for resilience.

Instead, we identify a substantively moderate but robustly negative effect of inequality on perceptions of meritocracy from within-country changes over time: as inequality rises, citizens’ belief in meritocracy declines.

Drawing on a scoping review methodology guided by Arksey and O’Malley (2005) and enhancements by Levac et al. (2010), this review synthesizes evidence from empirical, theoretical, and policy literature published between 1990 and mid-2025 to map how cumulative social and economic disadvantage unfolds across life stages and affects later life outcomes in SSA. Sixty-odd studies from 18 countries were included, spanning quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods designs. The review reveals that early life adversity such as low childhood socioeconomic status, limited education, and health shocks sets trajectories that constrain opportunities for formal employment, asset accumulation, and social mobility. These constraints are compounded over adulthood, especially among women and rural populations who disproportionately engage in informal work, caregiving, and face structural exclusions such as lack of pension coverage. The accumulation of disadvantage across life stages is consistently associated with poorer physical and mental health, reduced financial security, social isolation, and heightened vulnerability in old age. While a minority of studies explicitly frame their analyses in life course or cumulative disadvantage theory, many implicitly invoke life trajectory thinking. Longitudinal data remain scarce, and intersectional, contextually grounded, and comparative research is limited. The review underscores the need to adapt cumulative disadvantage models to the African context, accounting for macro-historical shocks, informal economies, kin networks, and nonmaterial assets, and to invest in life course–oriented policies.

First, drawing on a theory of legal order, we posit that societies balance normative stability and adaptability through metanorms—rules that govern the process by which norms are interpreted, changed and enforced. Second, we test this idea in the context of customary dispute resolution by elders among the Turkana, a pastoralist society in Kenya. Based on vignette experiments with 369 participants, we found that community members were significantly more willing to enforce decisions when elders aligned their conduct with metanorms. Elders are constrained in their ability to alter long-standing customs, but by following metanorms can create new rules for novel situations. These findings support our proposed mechanism: in the absence of centralized authority, metanorms governing normative institutions allow for adaptive norm change while preserving cultural continuity.

Our data shows a strategic yet adaptive campaign, including a systematic concentration of arbitrary searches on Thursdays, initial physical repression targeting primarily elites, and intensified repression during periods of dissent. Integrating additional disaggregated variables and employing fixed-effects Poisson models, we find that the short-term frequency of repression is significantly driven by protest activity, rather than sanction levels or cultural focal events. Russian authorities respond rapidly and increasingly harshly to dissent, pursuing a dual strategy of immediate protest suppression and long-term deterrence. CriTaRep fills critical gaps in existing datasets and provides new opportunities to study patterns and mechanisms of demographically targeted repression.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uz6ah_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uz6ah_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.04576444165609783}, {"title": "Comparative Challenges of Implementing IT Governance in SMEs: A Study of Bangladesh and Denmark", "authors": "Redwan Islam", "abstract": "IT governance has emerged as one of the most critical elements of organizational success in the modern digital economy in enabling technology assets to support business objectives, reduce risks, and ensure regulatory compliance. Whereas large organizations have the resources and expertise to adopt governance frameworks like COBIT, ISO/IEC 27001, or the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are at a significant disadvantage. Financial limitations, scarcity of skilled human resources, low management awareness level, and complexity in international compliance regulations are likely to deter SMEs from embracing good governance practices (Mirtsch et al., 2021; Almaqtari et al., 2024). These challenges are investigated in this research through a comparative study of SMEs in Bangladesh and Denmark, two different settings: a developing and a developed economy. My interest in pursuing this research stems from the fact that I have work experience at AIBL Capital Market Services Limited, where I observed directly the critical role that governance plays in maintaining operational security and efficiency. The inferences are that SMEs in Bangladesh are primarily faced with shortages of resources and infrastructure (Bangladesh Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology, 2018), while SMEs in Denmark are faced with the cost and complexity of complying with rigorous regulations such as GDPR and NIS2 European Commission, 2016; European Commission, 2022).

Using federal data on new postsecondary hires, we find that the introduction of early anti-DEI legislation was followed by a substantial decline in the share of faculty hires from marginalized groups and an increase in the share of White men, even before bills were signed into law. This shift was most pronounced at schools highly dependent on state funding and at teaching-oriented schools.

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to analyze texts across social sciences, yet their abilities to interpret causal statements and reconstruct causal structures remain uncertain in social science texts. This study examines to what extent LLMs can (a) identify causal sentences and (b) recover causal edges to reconstruct directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This examination relies on two text-based simulations and one experiment using real sociological texts. In simulated texts, models reliably detected explicit causal statements but often misclassified non-causal ones, particularly when probabilistic language was used. For causal graph recovery, clarity of expression strongly influenced accuracy. Across 500 replications with real texts, performance ranged from moderate to near perfect, revealing both model heterogeneity and inconsistency. These results indicate that LLMs can assist in extracting causal knowledge from social science texts, yet accurate inference of complex causal mechanisms still requires careful theoretical reasoning.

By contrast, Marcuse frames his entire critical activity in terms of a reactivation of the promise of equality, liberty and happiness that is enunciated by the French Enlightenment and enacted by the French Revolution.

The paper maps citizens’ perceptions regarding disclosures of AI use in journalism, addressing two key themes: (1) the practical information needs of news consumers about AI-generated content and (2) the specific rationales when exposed to (disclosures of) AI generated news content. Through qualitative focus groups (N=21), the exploratory research reveals a strong demand for clear, visible, and detailed disclosures about AI-generated content. Participants emphasized the necessity of including general source references akin to traditional authorship attributions, explicitly stating AI involvement - for example, a label such as ‘generated by AI’ alongside author and publication details. Visual indicators like logos or watermarks in contrasting colors were preferred to ensure AI disclosures are noticeable and not easily overlooked.

The elimination of the CPS Food Security Supplement (FSS) leaves a critical gap in the national data on economic well-being. This paper presents a model that addresses this gap by predicting national food insecurity rates in the absence of official USDA data. The model draws on established correlates of food insecurity – national rates of poverty and unemployment, and food-specific inflation – to estimate food insecurity rates for all individuals, adults, children, and households. The predicted rates align closely with actual food insecurity rates between 2010 and 2023, with a typical difference of 0.3 percentage points. Sensitivity tests show that the preferred model specification outperforms alternatives. The paper also presents predictions of 2024 food insecurity rates, for which national data are scheduled to be released later in October 2025. While continuing to measure food insecurity using the method employed by the USDA since 1995 is the only way to guarantee consistent data on this critical indicator, the model presented here may prove useful in estimating food insecurity in future years when this USDA data is unavailable.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydbgw_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ydbgw_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.018113377681042264}]
