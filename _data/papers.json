How material self‐interest influences citizens' welfare state behavior","authors":"Matias Engdal Christensen","abstract":"It is a long‐standing view that citizens support the welfare state because it provides insurance against future income losses. However, existing studies have struggled to isolate the effect of future‐oriented material self‐interest from normative and political predispositions. Using population‐wide, administrative panel data from Denmark, I study citizens' choice to take up government‐funded social insurance in times of economic uncertainty: a critical case for material self‐interest to be at stake. Using as‐if random variation in exposure to signals of unemployment risks, I show that economic uncertainty increases the probability of buying supplementary unemployment insurance coverage. Linking the administrative records to individual‐level survey data reveals that exposure to unemployment risk signals increases feelings of job insecurity, further suggesting that economic worries shape citizens' behavior within the welfare state. These findings highlight the role of material self‐interest in influencing the welfare state, providing valuable insights for policymakers when designing social insurance policies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12978","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12978","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.5344,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Speaking their language?: Multilingualism in party communication across democracies","authors":"Taishi Muraoka, Dahjin Kim, Christopher Lucas, Jacob Montgomery, Margit Tavits","abstract":"Which parties embrace multilingualism in their communication?

By so doing, we develop, for the first time, the classification of monolingual and multilingual parties around the world. Moreover, using this novel dataset, we explore what factors are associated with parties’ adoption of multilingualism and how multilingual parties predict the language use of candidates they nominate.

Do they generate votes for religious parties? The events may heighten religiosity, enlarging support for parties seen as owning religious policy issues. Such parties might also co‐opt the events to organize and campaign. We evaluate the electoral impact of India's Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival considered the world's biggest human assembly, leveraging its astrologically determined timing combined with districts’ proximity by rail to the festival sites. The Kumbh Mela boosts Hindu nationalists’ vote share. Mechanisms tests suggest it does so by increasing religious orthodoxy—seen in the adoption of Brahminical dietary practices—and by strengthening party capacity. There are mixed effects on communal conflict. The events are electorally polarizing; they cause India's main secular‐leaning party to perform better in regions with denser concentrations of religious minorities.

We experimentally evaluate the social and political consequences of a military policing intervention in Cali, Colombia, one of the world's most violent cities. The intervention, Plan Fortaleza , involved recurring, intensive military patrols randomized at the city block level. Our evaluation combines administrative crime and human rights data, surveys of more than 10,000 residents, a conjoint experiment, a “costly” behavioral measure, and qualitative interviews with 49 civil society leaders. Despite null or adverse effects on crime and human rights, we show that Plan Fortaleza improved citizen’ attitudes toward the military and increased their demand for military involvement in domestic law enforcement. It also strengthened citizens’ support for extrajudicial punishment and—alarmingly—for military coups in response to rising crime, potentially signaling a diminished commitment to democracy and the rule of law among the program's intended beneficiaries.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12977","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12977","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4876,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Accountability in Developing Democracies: The Impact of the Internet, Social Media, and Polarization","authors":"Horacio Larreguy, Pia J.

We focus on two global trends that we view as reshaping these accountability relationships in important ways: the rise of the internet and social media on the one hand and increasing political polarization on the other. We evaluate the impacts of these developments on the sanctioning of the performance of elected officials, the selection of elected officials, and the agency problem between elected officials and bureaucrats. Rather than offering definitive conclusions, we highlight key trade trade-offs and emphasize that the overall effects are contingent on the status quo. Notably, much of the existing evidence originates from developed democracies, presenting important opportunities for future research to address gaps in understanding accountability in developing contexts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-polisci-033123-015559","doi":"10.1146/annurev-polisci-033123-015559","journal_full":"Annual Review of Political Science","dist":0.4759,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Criminal Violence, the State, and Society","authors":"Omar García-Ponce","abstract":"The study of criminal violence has received increasing attention in political science over the past 15 years, as organized criminal groups have grown and diversified worldwide, unleashing unprecedented waves of violence.

Atkinson, Kevin Fahey, René Lindstädt, Zach Warner","abstract":"Research has demonstrated that decisions around military conflict can significantly impact governments’ political survival. One important strand of the extant literature has focused on the impact of military labor systems, with most academic studies distinguishing between two types of systems: conscription, in which citizens are compelled to serve; and market-based enlistment according to which citizens self-select into military service. In this article, we argue that this conceptualization of military labor systems misses substantial theoretical and empirical variation in recruitment of military personnel over time and across cases. We make two contributions. First, we introduce new data that allow us to capture an important and common additional category of military labor acquisition—selective conscription. Second, we use these new data to empirically demonstrate that selective systems afford governments significant opportunities to manipulate how the costs of military conflict are distributed across the population. Specifically, we provide empirical evidence showing that countries with selective conscription are more willing to tolerate battlefield casualties.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251328026","doi":"10.1177/00104140251328026","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.5126,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Precolonial Origins of African Nationalism","authors":"Vladimir Chlouba","abstract":"What explains the degree of national attachment expressed by contemporary Africans? Using historical data on early African statehood and survey responses from across the continent, I show that national identification among contemporary Africans was jointly shaped by the socialization efforts of precolonial rulers and the form of colonial rule employed by European administrators. In areas where precolonial rulers socialized their subjects to a common identity and colonial bureaucrats subsequently ruled through ethnic intermediaries, ethnic allegiance still trumps national identity because ethnic institutions continue to mediate the relationship between local communities and the state. In contrast, where policies of direct rule displaced precolonial rulers and formerly centralized groups lost political autonomy, the legacy of early statehood frequently produced the opposite outcome: interethnic cohesion. Departing from classical explanations that emphasize (post)colonial experiences, the findings advance our understanding of contemporary African nationalism.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251328030","doi":"10.1177/00104140251328030","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.4815,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Bureaucracy of Reparations and Political Engagement","authors":"Michael Weintraub, Abbey Steele, Sebastián Pantoja-Barrios","abstract":"Countries transitioning from civil war and authoritarian legacies often adopt transitional justice measures like reparations, prosecutions, and truth commissions.

In this study, we trace the impact of local cues in social media posts in three steps. First, we revisit the claim that MPs are electorally motivated in their use of local cues by analysing 1,316,458 Tweets by Swiss and German national MPs (2009–2019). Second, we use survey experiment data ( N = 16,597) to gauge whether voters reward local cues in social media posts with a higher likelihood of voting for a politician. Lastly, we investigate whether MPs' use of explicit local cues in Tweets leads them to obtain more preference votes in Swiss National Council elections (2011–2019). The overall image that emerges from these results is that while politicians use local cues particularly when campaigning, they are not directly electorally rewarded: both the results based on experimental and observational data do not provide evidence for the idea that adding local cues to social media posts comes with an electoral advantage.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.70018","doi":"10.1111/1475-6765.70018","journal_full":"European Journal of Political Research","dist":0.4914,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"One more constrained than the other: Asymmetrical ideological alignment and its implications for polarization","authors":"TADEAS CELY","abstract":"This study examines the ideological alignment of beliefs within opposing partisan camps in Europe. Integrating multiple types of research, I hypothesize that partisans on the ideological left exhibit greater alignment in their beliefs compared to those on the right – an asymmetry that extends across various issues. I argue that on the scale of ideological contention, it matters if partisans on one ideological pole are more aligned in beliefs than those on the other. Only the less ideological of opposing camps determines the extent of mutual disagreement. Utilizing conventional methods and innovative belief network modelling, I analyse survey data from the fourth and eighth waves of the European Social Survey (2008, 2016). To test the hypothesis, I match partisans with the data on their party's ideology, covering partisans from 131 parties in 15 European countries to test this hypothesis. My findings reveal that, both at the European level and within national contexts, there is a broad and substantive asymmetry between the right and the left across ideological dimensions and issues. However, the study also uncovers the limits of this asymmetry, highlighting a significant shift in ideological alignment on sociocultural issues on the right, indicating the emergence of a deeper, broader ideological conflict in that dimension. Furthermore, my analysis demonstrates the marginal influence of strategies like position blurring and programmatic nicheness. These insights shed light on the nature of partisan contention in Europe and how it disproportionately depends on ideological alignment on the right.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.70016","doi":"10.1111/1475-6765.70016","journal_full":"European Journal of Political Research","dist":0.5479,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Geographic representation in local politics: Evidence from parliamentary questions in German city councils","authors":"MORTEN HARMENING, JONA‐FREDERIK BAUMERT, SEBASTIAN BLOCK, MARTIN GROSS, DOMINIC NYHUIS, JAN VELIMSKY","abstract":"A well‐established body of research has highlighted the importance of geographic representation in party‐centred political systems.

Most importantly, previous studies have almost exclusively analysed geographic representation in national politics, where legislators represent comparatively large electoral districts. In contrast, this study focuses on patterns of geographic representation at the local level to understand whether and how specific neighbourhoods are represented in local politics. By studying parliamentary questions in 12 German city councils, we assess party efforts to represent their electoral strongholds. Methodologically, we go beyond existing research on geographic representation by building comprehensive dictionaries to assess geographic representation based on geolocated data from Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap. The results show that geographic representation is a common feature of local politics and that parties tend to focus on areas where they are electorally strong, particularly when they are incentivized to do so by the electoral system and when their electorate is highly localized.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/1475-6765.70019","doi":"10.1111/1475-6765.70019","journal_full":"European Journal of Political Research","dist":0.5003,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Local Economic Consequences of Foreign Direct Investment in Democracies and Autocracies","authors":"Tobias Rommel, Tabea Palmtag, Luca Messerschmidt","abstract":"Governments in developing and emerging countries aim to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) to generate growth.

Both effects should be stronger in autocracies compared to democracies, because autocrats face fewer political constraints to create profitable investment environments. Empirically, we leverage geo-located data on FDI projects from 2003 to 2018, which we combine with nightlights using two approaches: concentric buffers around project locations and global 10 × 10 km grid cells. Our estimator compares the effect of FDI on growth and inequality between areas that have already received FDI and areas that have not yet received FDI.

In the game with vote motivation, a unique pure-strategy equilibrium exists when the valence asymmetry is not too large. The higher-valence candidate chooses a more centrist platform than the disadvantaged candidate. In the game with win motivation, despite platform divergence due to costs of flip-flopping, both candidates aim for the median voter.

In this paper, we present an approach to construct “vec-tionaries” that boost validated dictionaries with word embeddings through nonlinear optimization. By harnessing semantic relationships encoded by embeddings, vec-tionaries improve the measurement of message features from text, especially those in short format, by expanding the applicability of original vocabularies to other contexts. Importantly, a vec-tionary can produce additional metrics to capture the valence and ambivalence of a message feature beyond its strength in texts. Using moral content in tweets as a case study, we illustrate the steps to construct the moral foundations vec-tionary, showcasing its ability to process texts missed by conventional dictionaries and to produce measurements better aligned with crowdsourced human assessments.

Second, we use an original conjoint experiment with 1,300 party selectors from six Swedish parties.

We also find that being associated with the issue is equally damaging to women’s and men’s political careers. Lastly, we conduct in-depth interviews with Swedish party selectors. These further illustrate that addressing this issue is perceived as deviating from the assertive model of a politician and that political violence is not regarded as a vote-winning issue.

Both Brexit and the national lockdown had an impact on participants' emotional well‐being but also forged enduring memories and played a role in shaping their identities. Individuals who displayed a stronger attachment to their political affiliations exhibited heightened levels of polarization.

This literature typically relies on measures of income concentration or gap-size, which reflect under-tested presumptions about how citizens perceive the economic conditions surrounding them. Utilizing survey data to explore perception of economic inequality in Americans’ residential environment, this note finds that measures capturing income concentration or gap-size perform poorly relative to a measure capturing the joint prevalence of “haves” and “have-nots.” These results suggest that commonly used measures of economic inequality may not fully capture the features of people’s daily environment used to perceive the existence or magnitude of inequality. The results guide future research toward using contextual indicators that treat inequality as a compound phenomenon involving manifestations of poverty and affluence.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.24","doi":"10.1017/psrm.2025.24","journal_full":"Political Science Research and Methods","dist":0.5463,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"People","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096515000591","doi":"10.1017/s1049096515000591","journal_full":"PS: Political Science & Politics","dist":0.2568,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Pandemic preparation without romance: insights from public choice","authors":"Alex Tabarrok","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01277-2","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01277-2","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.3652,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Editorial announcement","authors":"Peter T.

Despite its frequent use, it’s unclear precisely what Americans perceive of as woke. This study investigates perceptions of woke using a conjoint survey experiment. Respondents in the conjoint are tasked with selecting the more woke list. The lists contain various attributes, identities, and policies that have, over the past few years, been branded as woke. Our findings indicate that there’s generally broad agreement among Democrats and Republicans about what is woke. However, Democratic respondents are more likely associate lower salience racially progressive and gender-progressive items as woke, while Republican respondents identify higher salience items clearly aligned with the Democratic Party as woke. Independents, as a whole, have much less consistent views, tracking more closely with Democrats when it comes to some considerations while more closely with Republicans on others.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251335650","doi":"10.1177/20531680251335650","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.449,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"If I could turn back time: The authoritarian connection to nostalgia","authors":"Spencer Goidel, Kirby Goidel","abstract":"Comparative politics scholars have long noted the presence of authoritarian nostalgia in emerging democracies.

It does this through exploration of how two NGOs cultivate spaces for exchange and dialogue in rural and urban areas of the country’s Southwest. The first, SILO, works with communities in rural, peripheral and protected areas to respond to local challenges using art, science and technology, while the second, AfroGames, offers esports training to disadvantaged young people across the city of Rio de Janeiro. Building on discussions with those behind each NGO in March 2024, the article examines how both organisations reproduce and break from large-scale state and civil society efforts to promote social, cultural and digital inclusion in Brazil in the early 2000s. A key contention of the article is that contemporary efforts to promote digital inclusion in Brazil cannot be divorced from territorially rooted mobilisations for social justice. At the same time, it attends to key differences between the work of the NGOs analysed and the digital inclusion efforts of the early 2000s, for example, as regards their approach to free and open culture and the potential of the video games industry. The article argues that the work of both NGOs shows how, in the hands of communities and activists, even expressions of digital culture widely associated with platform economies, capital accumulation and individualism, such as retail platforms and esports, can be turned to provocative and emancipatory ends. It concludes by considering how the work of both NGOs contributes to recent research exploring the complexities of how platforms land in Latin America through their focus on how sociocultural practices and platforms intersect, reworking the strategies of Brazil’s digital inclusion movement and probing of the limits of autonomy in an era of pervasive platform capitalism.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251331866","doi":"10.1177/01634437251331866","journal_full":"Media, Culture & Society","dist":0.4129,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Environmental and social issues and the media game: Four ways to address mediated (in)visibility","authors":"Meri Frig, Visa Penttilä","abstract":"Many of the causes and impacts of environmental and social issues may seem invisible, while others are apparent yet overlooked.

Drawing on interviews with Nordic journalists, this exploratory qualitative study shows how journalists address the (in)visibility of environmental and social issues in four primary ways: uncovering wrongdoing, moderating false and inadequate information, explaining complex social/environmental topics, and popularizing issues.

However, in Myanmar, the military government has imposed strict control over social media since its coup in 2021, while using them to disseminate authoritarian propaganda. Civilians who have voiced opposition against the regime have been arrested, and foreign media networks have withdrawn their operations from the country due to governmental oppression. Recognizing the oppressive political climate and its impact on freedom of speech and public discourse on social media, this study aims to achieve two objectives: (1) constructing a theoretical model of connective democracy for Myanmar by integrating the concepts of freedom of speech and contractarianism, and (2) suggesting effective strategic social media communication strategies to liberate Myanmar.

Exploring this claim, we offer a contribution to ongoing debates concerning the democratic value of digital communication. Through a mixed-methods approach, including quantitative mapping of approximately 9,000 Danish Facebook groups, netnographic field studies of select groups, and interviews with group moderators, we investigate the groups as “friendlier spaces” of contemporary civic behaviors. We find that the groups enact two key principles of connective democracy: recognizing common identity invites mundane citizenship and negotiating common norms establishes a training ground for political participation. To conceptualize the civic behaviors that arise in the Facebook groups, we introduce the concept of digital community centers, drawing parallels to the cultural history of Danish community centers, which became ubiquitous in the early 1900s and served as hubs for socializing and political exchange throughout the 20th century. We conclude that citizen-led Facebook groups replicate the political potential of traditional community centers, thus serving as their digital equivalents. The groups not only support connective democracy on the ground but also prepare members for formal political participation, thereby holding potential to revitalize democracy in the digital era.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251329063","doi":"10.1177/20563051251329063","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4569,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"How to Rebuild Ukraine: A Synthesis and Critical Review of Policy Proposals","authors":"Torbjörn Becker, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, Beatrice Weder di Mauro","abstract":"The anticipation of Ukraine's postwar reconstruction has led to an avalanche of academic and policy analyses on how to rebuild the country.

By applying textual analysis to millions of judgment documents from all levels of courts in China, we construct measures of crime rates that vary across cities over time. Our estimations, using a shift-share instrumental variable, find a higher increase in crime rates in cities that experience a more severe export slowdown. The effects are more pronounced in the manufacturing-specializing regions, where there is a higher concentration of young people, migrants, and school dropouts. Negative export shocks also lead to reduced job opportunities, decreased labor earnings for migrants, and worsened psychological health. Alternative mechanisms, such as spending on social stability, appear to play a minor role. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on our baseline estimation suggests that approximately 13.1% of the interquartile difference in crime rates across cities can be explained by differences in their exposure to the export slowdown.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf024","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf024","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.5166,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Rise of the Engineer: Inventing the Professional Inventor During the Industrial Revolution","authors":"W Walker Hanlon","abstract":"How did the Industrial Revolution generate sustained economic growth?

There has been less research on the dynamic interdependence of attention: how paying attention now may affect performance later. In this paper, we exploit high-frequency data on decision-making by Major League Baseball umpires to examine this. We find that umpires apply greater effort to higher-stakes decisions, but also that effort applied to earlier decisions increases errors later. These findings are consistent with the umpire being endowed with a depletable ‘budget’ of attention or the psychological theory of ego depletion. There is no such interdependence across the breaks that occur during the game (at the end of each half-inning) suggesting that even short rest periods can replenish attention budgets. An expectation of higher stakes decisions in the future induces reduced attention to current decisions, consistent with a forward-looking agent allocating his budget strategically across a sequence of decisions of varying importance.

The theory conceptualizes these five moral foundations as specific modifications of fitness payoffs in a 2 × 2 game. We find that the five foundations are distinguishable from each other and evolutionarily stable. However, the five foundations are not a minimal set: strict subsets of the five moral foundations suffice to describe all preferences that are evolutionarily stable. Not all evolutionarily stable foundations deliver social-fitness improvement over the Nash equilibrium in the fitness game: we characterize which do. Finally, we study moral overdrive, i.e., the situation in which the moral component of preferences totally dominates fitness payoffs and drives decision-making entirely. While every one of the five foundations is compatible with moral overdrive in at least one fitness game, there is no fitness game in which moral overdrive is compatible with social-fitness improvement. These results are partially extended to n × n games.

The latter allows us to identify the agent’s conditional beliefs about the proxy given each state realization, which in turn suffices for indirectly identifying her beliefs about the original state space.

We formalize these ideas in the context of a repeated-game setting and show that a cartel can attain higher payoffs by having the preselected winner randomize its bid and keep it secret from other members.

However, little is known regarding the experiences of internationally displaced Ukrainians.

Building on the aspirations-capabilities framework, we analyse how aspirations and capabilities, combined with macro and micro-factors, shape the narratives and decision-making processes of these displaced individuals regarding a possible return. Our findings reveal the interplay between macro sociopolitical environments and micro-factors such as stigma and trauma, highlighting a strong gender dimension. We showcase the concept of “virtual return”, underlining the role of digital connectivity in maintaining transnational ties and contributing to home country recovery.

Conversely, even though these irregular migrants encounter many obstacles along the route, they risk their lives in the hopes of securing a better future for themselves and their families. However, very few empirical studies have been conducted to examine the key factors that trigger this group's desperation for irregular migration. To fill this gap, this article examines this group's motivations for migration and the decision‐making process for such migration by drawing on primary data collected from 100 returnee migrants. It uses Evan's (2002, 2007) ‘Bounded Agency’ and de Haas's (2010) ‘Aspirations‐Capabilities Framework’ for exploring the broader spectrum of the phenomenon of irregular migration from Bangladesh to Europe. This article looks at how structural constraints, individual aspirations, and capabilities interact in shaping migration decisions. The findings demonstrate how socio‐economic constraints and a lack of legal migration options push migrants to follow dangerous and unorthodox routes in search of better economic possibilities in the contradiction‐ridden neoliberal system.

To better understand such issues, this paper explores the lived realities of old‐age return migrants in Zimbabwe to answer the question: What informs the return and reintegration of old‐age migrants in Zimbabwe? We unpack this and other questions using data from in‐depth interviews with 10 old‐age return migrants, as well as several snapshots from semi‐formal and informal conversations with returnees' family members in one of Zimbabwe's mainstay migrant communities in Matabeleland.

However, little research has explored how gender differences in education for second-generation immigrants compare to the children of U.S.-born Whites over historical and contemporary time periods. Immigrants arrive with varying levels of socioeconomic status and may come from countries with paternalistic ideologies that reinforce traditional gender norms. However, immigrants also experience assimilation over time and may begin to mirror the U.S.-born in their educational outcomes by the second generation. While national trends show that women have surpassed men in years of education, we question whether immigrants will experience similar trends, or whether their outcomes will vary by national origin. We analyze newly obtainable linked census data collected from 1940 to the present, a timeline where linked data were previously unavailable, to test these ideas. These data offer insight into gendered trends in education by family background and socioeconomic status using a broader timeline than studies before. We find that while there is variation in the degree to which gender differences in education occur by ethnic origin, overall trends for immigrants are similar to those for U.S.-born Whites regardless of socioeconomic status in childhood. In the Industrial Era, men generally attained more years of schooling than women. However, there is greater gender equality and often a female advantage occurring for most groups in the post-Industrial Era. Educational trends for Blacks are an anomaly, whereby women have attained more years of schooling than men in both Eras.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251329019","doi":"10.1177/01979183251329019","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.6436,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Book Review: Gendered Vulnerabilities and Violence in Forced Migration SalehinMohammad Musfequs. 2024.

The findings indicate that individuals experiencing health problems are more likely to expect to move domestically within the next 12 months and to take preparatory steps for international migration, such as purchasing a ticket or applying for a visa. However, health problems do not significantly correlate with general aspirations for international migration, suggesting their role is more pronounced in short-term migration expectations and concrete preparations rather than long-term migration preferences. Healthcare dissatisfaction is strongly associated with international migration aspirations but shows little association with actual preparations. It is also linked to higher expectations for (domestic) migration in the short term. Notably, the combined experience of health problems and healthcare dissatisfaction dampens the likelihood of domestic migration expectations, particularly in low-income countries, suggesting potential barriers for individuals facing dual vulnerabilities. Migration aspirations related to poor health and healthcare dissatisfaction are most pronounced among active-age, affluent, and highly educated urban residents — those with a greater “ability for migration.”","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251325208","doi":"10.1177/01979183251325208","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5617,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Gendered Ways Families Reduce International Migration and Mobility","authors":"Jacob Richard Thomas","abstract":"Prior scholars have examined how in gendered ways families encourage, support, and sponsor family members to migrate and how migrants had confronted and overcame opposition from family members before they migratedt abroad. Yet we know less about how and why families prevent many potential migrants from migrating abroad. I draw on semistructured interviews and observational data from 61 Chinese parents and children in a region of Fujian which has had a historically high percentage of emigrants from China. Although China's traditional patrilocal and patrilineal kinship system puts stronger sanctions on sons than daughters from moving away from their parents, recent changes in China lead parents to oppose children and especially daughters from going abroad. This opposition derives from parent's (1) concerns for the child's safety and cultural-linguistic survival, (2) socioeconomic constraints and intergenerational resource dependence, and (3) extrafamilial pressures to conform to social norms, all further bolstered by filial piety of children toward parents and the strong paternalistic influence parents exercise over theirchildren's marital, educational, and career choices. This parental opposition lessens as adult children age and their economic resource dependence declines. This contributes to research on how family dynamics, intergenerational pressures, and the demands of the life course reduce international mobility and migration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251329050","doi":"10.1177/01979183251329050","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.517,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"A Fine Balance: Exploring Job Quality in Platform Work Between Migrants and Nonmigrants","authors":"Georgiana Mathurin, Laura Lam, Souhail Al-Alaoui, Anna Triandafyllidou","abstract":"Migrants’ engagement in digital platform work is pervasive in many cities around the world and certainly in Canada's metropoles (Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal).

In the context of assessing credibility in conversion-based asylum claims in migration courts, substantive rationality entails applying general criteria consistently to evaluate asylum applicants’ credibility based on objective evidence, while also acknowledging that individuals may prioritize their values over their legal conformity, as seen in the case of asylum applicant converts. The Court’s credibility assessments, while intended to determine the trustworthiness of asylum claims, can lead to substantively irrational outcomes due to subjective judgment and overemphasis on written evidence. Politically appointed lay judges further complicate the decision-making process, often resulting in dissenting opinions from professional judges.

Given this substantial financial investment, it is essential to evaluate the impact of housing policies on childbirth intentions. This study examines the housing preferences of unmarried young adults who are potential beneficiaries of government support and analyzes anticipated changes in their childbirth intentions when provided with housing assistance. Based on an online survey of 310 participants, the findings indicate that housing loans are the most preferred policy, followed by the special supply of presale housing. Respondents overwhelmingly reported that their intention to have children would increase if their preferred housing support were provided, with the special supply of presale housing having the greatest effect. Additionally, the study highlights that young adults prioritize housing quality and a safe living environment over affordability alone. The results further reveal that nonmetropolitan residents, older respondents, and those with strong pro‐natalist values are the most responsive to housing support. By offering empirical evidence from the South Korean context, this study contributes to international discussions on housing policies and fertility, emphasizing the necessity of targeted policy interventions to effectively address the low birthrate crisis.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70036","doi":"10.1002/psp.70036","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.4574,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"International Student Mobility: Precarity, Pandemics and Resilience","authors":"S.

The notion of ecotone was first applied for the study of the contact zones between ecological systems. Over the last two decades, it has been used by scholars of postcolonial literature for the analysis of spaces of cultural interactions. Bridging this strand of work with the debate on more‐than‐relational space, this paper outlines the concept of migratory ecotones understood as the outcome of the process of territorialization of intersecting transnational circulations. Migratory ecotones are ambivalent spaces underlain by contradictory forces: a principle of encounter and cultural interaction, but also a principle of power, conflict, distribution, and hierarchy. We argue that ecotones are more‐than‐relational spaces in three regards: current encounters are shaped by the material environment in which they are taking place, by the political forces constraining the capabilities of migrants, by past encounters and events weighing on present ones. The theoretical considerations developed in this paper will be supported by a literary analysis of a short story by Canadian writer and artist Shani Mootoo and by the political geography analysis of a border camp, the Jungle of Calais.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70034","doi":"10.1002/psp.70034","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5301,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Emotion regulation and mental health across cultures: a systematic review and meta-analysis","authors":"Mark Shuquan Chen, Qiyue Cai, Deemah Omari, Drishti Enna Sanghvi, Shibo Lyu, George A.

We hypothesize that the human BLA is not necessary for prosocial behavior per se, but fine-tunes the degree of prosociality as a function of the social distance between actor and recipient of a prosocial act. We tested five participants with Urbach–Wiethe disease (UWD) who had isolated, bilateral damage to BLA and compared their behavior in a modified dictator game to that of 16 healthy control participants matched for (neuro-) psychological traits and cultural and socioeconomic background. In this game, participants selected eight people from their social environment and assigned them to variable social distance levels ranging from 1 (emotionally closest person) to 100 (random stranger on the street). They decided how much of a monetary endowment they would share with each person at each social distance. Compared to controls, UWD participants were less generous overall and showed steeper social discounting, that is, their willingness to share declined more sharply with increasing social distance. This difference in social discounting could not be explained by empathy, personality, or social network size. Our data suggest that BLA is critical for resolving the conflict between selfish and altruistic motives during social discounting. This finding underlines the BLA’s role in model-based social cognition, calibrating prosocial behavior based on the social-emotional distance between individuals.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500692122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2500692122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.388,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Introducing the Special Feature on housing differences and inequality over the very long term","authors":"Timothy A.

Due to data shortage, little is known about subnational mobility of scientists and the interrelationships between their internal and international migration patterns. We used data on 30+ million Scopus publications of 19+ million authors to infer migration from changes in affiliations. Our publicly shared database of global subnational estimates of migration reveals relevant disparities in the attractiveness of subnational regions. While, at the country level, some countries have acted as a global hub that attracts scholars from throughout the world, at the subnational level, some of their regions have negative net migration rates, with implications for scientific output and regional development, as well as the perpetuation of migration corridors. On average, subnational inequalities in attracting and sending scholars have increased for international but decreased for internal migration. In most countries, there is no single trend such that all subnational regions have been sending or receiving more scholars. Instead, a mix of patterns has been simultaneously at work, on the backdrop of globalization of migration, which is an asymmetric process where specific regions and subpopulations have higher access to international migration. For most subnational regions, when they are attractive for international migrants, they are also attractive for internal migrants, which is not always the case for emigration. Our results have implications for the global circulation of academic talent by adding the dimension of internal migration to “brain drain” and “brain circulation” in international migration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2424521122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2424521122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.565,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Assessing grand narratives of economic inequality across time","authors":"Gary M.

One narrative focuses on doomsday predictions of AI posing long-term existential risks for humanity. Another narrative prioritizes immediate concerns that AI brings to society today, such as the reproduction of biases embedded into AI systems. A significant point of contention is that the “existential risk” narrative, which is largely speculative, may distract from the less dramatic but real and present dangers of AI. We address this “distraction hypothesis” by examining whether a focus on existential threats diverts attention from the immediate risks AI poses today. In three preregistered, online survey experiments (N = 10,800), participants were exposed to news headlines that either depicted AI as a catastrophic risk, highlighted its immediate societal impacts, or emphasized its potential benefits. Results show that i) respondents are much more concerned with the immediate, rather than existential, risks of AI, and ii) existential risk narratives increase concerns for catastrophic risks without diminishing the significant worries respondents express for immediate harms.

In 1955, Simon Kuznets hypothesized that rising economic growth raises inequality, which levels off as that growth continues. Kuznets’ “curve,” which is a cornerstone of development economics, was based on data from a small sample of rich capitalist economies. Here, we draw on the GINI database, which includes area measurements of 53,464 residences from 1,176 settlements dating from 21,000 BC to the present, and published data from the Spatial Analysis in Maya Studies (SAMS) group, to radically reevaluate Kuznets’ curve. We use Gini coefficients of residential disparity, a proxy of inequality, and mean residence area, a proxy of productivity, to investigate past sustainable development in the Bronze Age Interaction Zone (BAIZ), the Mundo Maya, and Britain prior to, over the course of, and after the Roman conquest. We interpolate spatial patterns across each zone to statistically evaluate changes in inequality and economic growth. We find a recurring pattern in which phases of sustainable development, a rise in productivity without a rise in inequality, gave way to increasing inequality. These patterns resemble those Branko Milanovic termed “Kuznets’ waves,” albeit at timescales better described as “tides,” which began after the introduction of weight metrology, an early form of economic governance associated with long-distance exchange. We posit that past sustainable development was predicated on balancing reciprocity from the bottom–up with mechanisms like early weight metrology but was repeatedly forestalled as inchoate elites co-opted these mechanisms.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400603121","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2400603121","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4463,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Changes in agglomeration and productivity are poor predictors of inequality across the archaeological record","authors":"Scott G.

In today’s cities, neighborhoods are often characterized as relatively homogenous and may exhibit segregation along various socioeconomic dimensions. However, even within neighborhoods of similar social or economic status, there is often residential disparity, which in turn impacts perceived inequality. Drawing on the Global Dynamics of Inequality (GINI) project database, we study housing inequality within a sample of neighborhoods using the Gini coefficient of residential unit area and related measures of inequality. We examine patterns of intracommunity inequality within more than 80 settlements from diverse spatiotemporal contexts including some of the earliest cities in Mesopotamia, the Roman Empire, the Classic Maya region, the Central Andes, and the Indus River Basin. Residential disparity differs within and among sectors of these settlements; some neighborhoods exhibit more similarity in residence size, resulting in lower degrees of housing inequality, while other sectors display greater variations in residence size with higher degrees of housing inequality. We observe a meaningful relationship between neighborhood inequality and population size, but not date of foundation or longevity of occupation. The macro-level structural processes associated with varying forms of governance seem to trickle down to the scale of the neighborhood. These findings may help explain why more unequal systems are not necessarily more unstable, as the inequality people experienced in their neighborhoods may generally have been less than that present in the overall settlement.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400699121","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2400699121","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.5034,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"War both reduced and increased inequality over the past ten thousand years","authors":"Mark D.

Some have argued that conflict grows the gap between rich and poor. Others counter that violence levels out wealth differences. The GINI Project Database is a large global sample of archaeological data on house sizes created to investigate what factors influenced economic inequality over long periods of time, including warfare. Over 39,000 individual residential units were coded as having fortifications present or absent, with about a third in fortified settlements (n = 13,372) and two-thirds in unfortified settlements (n = 25,897). We compared residential disparity (differences in residential unit sizes within a settlement) at sites around the world (n = 770) dating as far back as 10,000 y ago. We found strong support for the expectation that conflict was linked with increasing residential disparity (i.e., wealth inequality), specifically when governance was less collective and the main factor limiting agricultural production was available land. However, we also found long periods, especially in the earliest eras represented in the database, when fortified settlements had residential disparity less than or equal to unfortified settlements. These early societies tended to be more collective with available labor limiting agricultural production. We speculate that in these communities, the relative value of coalition building was higher, whereas in cases where conflict was associated with rising residential disparity, elites found a way to leverage their wealth to protect property. These contradictory models help explain why war co-occurs with increasing inequality in some cases and decreasing inequality in others.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400695121","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2400695121","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4206,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Toward multiscalar measures of inequality in archaeology","authors":"Enrico R.

Yet, Gini coefficients could be obtained across different scales of aggregation, from small neighborhoods within a larger settlement to an ensemble of multiple settlements that are part of the same polity. These different scales of aggregation represent considerable methodological and theoretical challenges, as larger scales might, for example, imply greater social and economic variation within groups and thus affect the Gini coefficients. Furthermore, these issues can also be exacerbated by the idiosyncrasies and limitations of historical and archaeological datasets.

It accompanies landscape modifications and subsistence practices in which land (rather than labor) limits production, and growth of hierarchies of settlement size. Gini coefficients are markedly higher through time in settlements at or near the top of such hierarchies; settlements not enmeshed in these systems remain relatively egalitarian even long after plant and animal domestication. We infer that some households in top-ranked settlements were able to exploit the network effects, agglomeration opportunities, and (eventually) political leverage provided by these hierarchies more effectively than others, likely boosted by efficient intergenerational transmission of material resources after increased sedentism made that more common. Since population growth is associated with increased sedentism, more land-limited production, and the appearance and growth of settlement hierarchies, it is deeply implicated in the postdomestication rise of wealth inequality.

We address this hypothesis using the Global Dynamics of InequalIty (GINI) project database, estimating economic inequalities based on disparities in residential unit area and storage capacity within sites in different world regions and through time. We find that inequality was significantly greater in land-limited than labor-limited regimes, whether based on residence area or storage capacity, though governance could moderate these differences. Increasing inequality with larger residence and/or site size is associated with underlying shifts from labor- to land-limited economies. Transitions from labor- to land-limited regimes also appear to underlie the development of extended political hierarchies. Increases in inequality after cultivation became common in each hemisphere similarly reflect shifts from labor- to land-limited systems. Land-limited systems in the eastern hemisphere, incorporating animal traction, exhibit an upward trend in inequality over time, while a downward trend in the western hemisphere reflects the lower persistence of land-limited regimes based solely on human labor.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2400694122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2400694122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4292,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Is killing animals an effective way to regulate populations?","authors":"Amy McDermott","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2506919122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2506919122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.2248,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Psychological impacts of climate change on US youth","authors":"Ans Vercammen, Britt Wray, Yoshika S.

Experiences such as climate distress and eco-anxiety have implications for the health and well-being of societies and economies, including individuals’ mental health and future planning, as well as their agency beliefs. Here, we show in a large sample of US youth (n = 2,834, ages 16 to 24) that the majority of US youth experience moderate climate distress and some functional interference from climate-related thoughts and feelings and a neutral to slightly positive sense of agency. They feel concern, interest, disappointment, frustration, sadness, anxiousness, and anger as affective responses to the crisis, and a majority report that their climate awareness may influence their plans for education, travel, and family planning. The key takeaway of this study is that the psychological impacts of climate change in US youth can have either impairing or strengthening effects, especially in the face of increased perceived direct exposure. Results show that self-reported direct experience of climate-related events is associated with increased eco-anxiety, climate distress, and impact of climate change on future planning, but also fortifying responses such as psychological adaptation and agency. These findings highlight the need for health systems and communities to prepare to address increased climate distress and related concerns in US youth as perceived exposure to climate-related hazards increases, in ways that strengthen healthy coping and agency to act.

They provide criteria to distinguish cooperation from defection and establish rules to sustain cooperation, shaped through long-term trial and error. While principles for successful institutions have been proposed, the mechanisms underlying their emergence remain poorly understood. To address this, we introduce the evolutionary dynamical-systems game theory that couples game actions with environmental dynamics and explores the evolution of cognitive frameworks for decision-making. We analyze a minimal model of common-pool resource management, where resources grow naturally and are harvested. Players use decision-making functions to determine whether to harvest at each step, based on environmental and peer monitoring. After evolution, decision-making functions enable players to detect selfish harvesting and punish it by overharvesting, which degrades the environment. This process leads to the self-organization of norms that classify harvesting actions as cooperative, defective, or punitive. The emergent norms for “cooperativeness” and rules of punishment serve as institutions. The environmental and players’ states converge to distinct modes characterized by limit-cycle attractors, representing temporal regularities in socio-ecological systems. These modes remain stable despite slight variations in individual decision-making, illustrating the stability of institutions. We measure evolutionary robustness of decision-making functions, defined as the capacity to keep dominance against invasion. It is revealed that plasticity, the ability to adjust actions to cope with diverse opponents, allows for such robustness. This work introduces foundational concepts in evolutionary dynamical-systems games and elucidates the mechanisms underlying the self-organization of social institutions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2500960122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2500960122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3912,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"When state support for science fails","authors":"Antonio Lazcano","abstract":"The establishment and growth of scientific communities require long-term planning, political backing, and social and economic support.

Drawing on psychological contract theory and an empirical study in the English NHS, this research illustrates how an explicit psychological contract (EPC) can facilitate building and maintaining trust, even through challenging times. Our ethnographic observations reveal how a regular face‐to‐face meeting between regulators and hospital leaders provided a stable context through which the EPC could be operationalized to make fulfillment and breach visible, prompting responses that served to build and maintain trust.

This phenomenon is known as the Asian American Achievement Paradox (AAAP). Positive selectivity of Asian immigrants and cultural accounts are two competing explanations, but they are rarely disentangled empirically due to the high collinearity between immigrant selectivity and culture. This study offers a modified version of cultural explanations, clarifies the distinctions between competing explanations based on the same criteria, and tests them by investigating the educational achievements of second-generation Asian Americans using the full-count 1940 Census matched to the 1930 Census. During this period, Asian immigrants were not hyper-selected, so the entanglement of immigrant selectivity and culture is less of a concern. The results are largely consistent with the cultural explanation, revealing the AAAP to be a century-old phenomenon with a previously unknown complexity. The transmission of culture from the society of origin is further evident in that the AAAP is limited to East Asians and does not apply to Filipino Americans, even though contextual selectivity in education is similar across Asian ethnic groups in 1940.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251325259","doi":"10.1177/00031224251325259","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.5982,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Making Sense of Honor Killings","authors":"Ozan Aksoy, Aron Szekely","abstract":"Honor killings, which occur when women are perceived to have broken purity norms and bring “dishonor” to their family, pose profound moral and societal problems and underrecognized sociological puzzles. Given the immense cost, why do families murder their own daughter, niece, or cousin? Conversely, given the tragic consequences, why are norms broken in the first place? Drawing on accounts of honor killings, we characterize the key actors, actions, and incentives, and develop two interlinked theoretical models, one on norm-enforcement and another on norm-breaking. The former specifies the conditions under which honor norms should hold, the latter, counterintuitively, predicts that honor killings occur most frequently when honor norms are contested; not when they are strictest. Analyzing data from 24 countries and ~26,000 individuals and building a unique dataset of honor killings from Turkey, we find support for the hypotheses. Honor norms are stronger when laws offer leniency for honor killings, families’ loss of reputation is more consequential, and community cohesion is higher. Actual killings have an inverse-U-shaped link with the prevalence of honor norms. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of honor norms and killings and offers one of the most comprehensive empirical analyses of the factors influencing honor killings.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251324504","doi":"10.1177/00031224251324504","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.4605,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Demise of Affirmative Action in College Admissions","authors":"Natasha Warikoo","abstract":"Affirmative action began as a bipartisan policy to address racial inequality in the workplace and in higher education.

This review traces the dominant cultural framings of affirmative action in college admissions and their changing usage in US political and legal systems over time, the relationship between framing and public support for affirmative action, and evidence for the central frames used to defend or critique the policy. I argue that understanding affirmative action's framing over time by political actors is key to understanding its demise. During the 1960s and 1970s, university leaders framed affirmative action as a mechanism to promote racial equity. From the late 1970s, advocates reframed the policy as a tool to promote the benefits of diversity. During that same period, critics advanced a reverse discrimination frame. As the reverse discrimination and diversity frames took hold in court, it became impossible for advocates to successfully excavate the earlier equity framing. As such, defenders were left with the diversity frame, a weak defense of a critical policy that eventually fell.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-soc-090324-040338","doi":"10.1146/annurev-soc-090324-040338","journal_full":"Annual Review of Sociology","dist":0.4919,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Meaning in Hyperspace: Word Embeddings as Tools for Cultural Measurement","authors":"Andrei Boutyline, Alina Arseniev-Koehler","abstract":"Word embeddings are language models that represent words as positions in an abstract many-dimensional meaning space.

We argue that embeddings operationalize context spaces, where words’ positions can reflect any regularity in usage. We then examine sociologists' embeddings-based measurements to argue that most sociologists are instead implicitly interested in capturing concept spaces, where positions strictly indicate meaningful conceptual features (e.g., femininity or status). Because meaningful features yield regularities in usage, context spaces can proxy for concept spaces. However, context spaces also reflect surface regularities in language—e.g., syntax, morphology, dialect, and phraseology—which are irrelevant to most sociological investigations and can bias cultural measurement.

With reciprocity, they lobby for domestic tariff cuts in exchange for liberalization abroad, which alters the link between domestic institutions and trade policies.

Following Bentley Allan, we propose to treat the Planetary as an example of scientific cosmology, thus emphasizing how astrobiology supports a much broader philo- sophical worldview that shines a new light on persistent problems related to organizing human inhabitation of the Earth. Starting with the analysis and speculative elaboration on Allan’s theory of cosmological shifts in international orders during Western modernity, we associate the Anthropocene discourse as an inaugurating moment in the consolida- tion of the Planetary’s scientific cosmology, grounded in the astrobiology’s metabolic per- spective on complex adaptive systems. The narrative of the paper offers a genealogy of this perspective, including the most recent research about information metabolisms and biosphere-technosphere coupling in astrobiology, which paves the way for the explanation of the economy itself as a metabolic entity. After the review of adjacent philosophical po- sitions associated with ecological economics and the theory of complex adaptive systems, the paper concludes with remarks on the Planetary as a cornerstone of an international order that yields economic imperatives governed by a generic view of the Earth as a mem- ber of a potentially large and diverse category of habitable planets.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4963w_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/4963w_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3471,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Transit Investment and Neighborhood Transitions: Evidence from the Routes Not Taken","authors":"Amber DeJohn, Matthew Palm, Matthew Suandi","abstract":"Transit projects reshape the built environment and impact access to employment. Disentangling transit construction impacts from pre-existing trends presents methodological challenges.

The older adult population 55+ within 15-minute walking distance from new stations declines. Workers in station catchments have shorter commute distances but trend toward lower-skilled sectors. The proportion of workers aged 30-45 and 55+ increases, while the share of individuals under 30 declines. We identify this increasing population as \"established essential workers.\" Housing prices show a marginally significant 9.8\\% increase when using construction start dates in defining treatment timing, but effects become insignificant when using opening dates. In general, light rail transit investment supports older workers in lower-skilled jobs while deterring older, retired adults and those in other trades.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ftn58_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ftn58_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.51,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Analysis of Peru’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic according to the instrumental perspective","authors":"Grace Annette Jimenez Lopez","abstract":"This research analyzes Peru’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic through the lens of the instrumental perspective, one of the main theories in Public Administration and that emphasizes rational decisions within goal-oriented and hierarchical structures.

This chapter examines how the concept of BRICS has evolved within social science discourse since the early 2000s, from its initial framing as an economic growth engine to a more complex phenomenon representing potential shifts in global governance and power dynamics. Through a systematic analysis of mainstream social science publications, the chapter maps the intellectual communities, geographic distributions, and funding sources that have shaped scholarly engagement with BRICS as a Global South phenomenon. Employing computational methods to analyze a specialized corpus, the research identifies key structural features of BRICS-related debates, disciplinary contributions, and underlying epistemic frameworks. By exploring how various social science disciplines—from economics and international relations to postcolonial studies and area studies—have approached BRICS, the chapter provides insights into how Global South subjects enter and circulate within mainstream knowledge production systems. This broad yet integrated analysis offers a comprehensive overview of how social sciences have documented, interpreted, and contributed to the evolving understanding of BRICS as a significant force in global affairs.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w792m_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/w792m_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4387,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Comparing Different Methods of Compensating for Survey Breakoffs","authors":"Zeming Chen, Alexandru Cernat, Natalie Shlomo","abstract":"Web surveys are increasingly popular but tend to have more breakoffs compared to interviewer-administered surveys.

This study develops a simulation where the breakoff rate and the cause of breakoffs are manipulated and then compensated for using five different methods. We find that using nonresponse weighting and multiple imputation compensate for breakoffs better than other methods investigated.

This paper investigates how observing others’ apolitical characteristics – such as their gender, age, personality, or lifestyle choices – influences people’s decision to engage in political conversations, providing evidence supporting the “incidental model” of political conversations (Minozzi et al., 2020). We introduce the “dynamic parallel conjoint design” and field it in the Czech Republic, France, Italy, and Sweden. Our findings indicate that observing apolitical similarities with conjoint profiles consistently increases the likelihood of engaging in political conversation. While some studies suggest that observing apolitical similarities informs expectations about others’ political ideologies, which are then used to select conversation partners, our results show that political conversations are driven by the propensity to interact with people similar in apolitical respects, regardless of ideological expectations. Our study contributes to debates on political conversation dynamics and introduces an innovative methodological approach to studying implicit mediation in political behavior.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j8nr_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/6j8nr_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.6153,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Address Challenges Markowitz (1952) Faces: A New Measure of Asset Risk","authors":"George Y. Nie","abstract":"Markowitz (1952) asset risk (MAR) has long been challenged. First, as an impostor of asset risk, volatility captures the noise of asset risk over maturity that improperly reflects asset risk (which has to be measured over a unit of time length to be cumulative since asset holder’s risk approaches zero as the holding time length approaches zero). Second, volatility does not decrease asset value while volatility of a lognormal distribution actually raises value. We thus argue that asset risk drives volatility, but not vice versa, implying that asset risk cannot be diversified away. Third, support to MAR appears to arise from a confusion between asset value and wealth utility: the law of diminishing marginal utility supports that volatility reduces the latter. The above causes explain why CAPM and Fama-French models have long been struggling to price asset volatilities. To address these challenges, we propose that the volatility (variance) of realized (expected) asset value approaches zero as the measuring distance approaches zero. We delineate expected asset value (which asset risk impacts without a distribution) and volatility (which does not affect the former following a quasi-normal distribution we proposed). Our asset risk for a specific asset excludes the macrorisk in Nie (2024a) that is tied to all assets denominated by the currency. To be comparable across assets and firms, our asset risk is a 5-year payment’s risk that approaches zero as the distance approaches zero. We show that equity price reflects the present value of a payment spanning over the predictable lifetime of firm performance, and that an option’s price minus its present value reflects the overcharge or transaction cost. Our asset risk, captured as risk premium, thus solves issues that have long been challenging agency theories, and redefines firm misvaluation theories.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/83pny_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/83pny_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3253,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Technology governance shareholder activism: When investors disagree with executives over the direction of technological change","authors":"Vili Lehdonvirta, Rachel Ricucci","abstract":"Literature on the political economy of large technology firms conceptualizes them as singular actors or agents in service of capital. We problematize this notion by drawing on literature on politics of corporate control, which identifies an inherent conflict between capital and management. We posit that technology firms’ shareholders should prefer technologies that entail fewer societal externalities than what the companies’ executives prefer. To observe such conflict, we analyse annual general meeting documents of top fifty tech firms, identifying shareholder proxy ballot initiatives aimed at shaping technological development toward less societal risk. Shareholders at Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft raised concerns over technologies such as AI and cloud computing, in some cases influencing the company’s behaviour. Such technology governance shareholder initiatives grew rapidly from 2015 onward to represent a fifth of all initiatives by 2024. We argue that this activism was part of a broader social movement that in the U.S. expressed itself via corporate governance institutions, because opportunities for legislative intervention were blocked. We contribute a model that conceptualizes technology firms not as actors but as sites of contestation between competing interests expressed via political, market, and corporate governance institutions. The model helps to explain why executives at technology firms with significant socio-political externalities invest not only into political lobbying but also disproportionately into corporate control. We also contribute to substantive technology governance literatures by highlighting corporate democracy as a neglected means for broader societal interests to influence technology.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bkrp5_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/bkrp5_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4091,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Understanding disappearances in Mexico City: a data-driven analysis","authors":"Daniel Aguilar Velazquez, Rubén Calvario Pérez, Carlos Mondragón Mendoza, Alfonso Valenzuela-Aguilera","abstract":"Mexico is experiencing a crisis of violence, marked by an increase in disappearances. However, key information remains unknown, such as the primary gender and age of the victims, the high-risk zones for disappearances, and the relationship between these areas and the economic and security environment. We used a government database of 3,450 disappearances in Mexico City, together with scraped data to analyze the phenomenon of missing persons. We found that disappearances are not homogeneously distributed along Mexico City, the central district has the highest disappearance rate per capita, which can be attributed to city mobility for job locations. Men account for 62.5% of missing persons, but women aged 15-19 are the most vulnerable group. There is a strong correlation (r = 0.95) between reports of drug dealing and disappearances, both of which may be related to the presence of organized crime. Furthermore, when disappearances are normalized to account for mobility related to job locations, a strong negative correlation (r = −0.7) emerges between disappearances and housing prices. This suggests a pattern of socio-economic segregation in disappearances, with higher rates in areas with lower housing prices. Integrating data on disappearances, housing prices, reports of drug dealing, and perception of insecurity for each municipality, we implemented K-means algorithm. Without spatial information, K-means divided Mexico City in west and east. In the east side, people are more vulnerable to disappearances than those in the west side.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gczax_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/gczax_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.505,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The cruel optimism of suicide prevention: thinking beyond the mental health model.","authors":"Hazel Marzetti, Amy Chandler, Alexander Oaten, Ana Jordan","abstract":"Suicide has long been constructed as an individual, pathological problem of the mind, requiring a combination of clinical care and interpersonal support to prevent it.

We evaluate two state-of-the-art open-source LLMs—Qwen-QwQ-32B and Llama-4-maverick—on their capacity to accurately categorise scholarly papers according to predefined theoretical frameworks. Our methodology employs two distinct enhancement techniques: an iterative processing approach designed to improve reliability by generating multiple independent classifications for each document, and a calibrated weighting technique aimed at enhancing validity by adjusting probability distributions toward reference distributions. To assess validity, we employ proximity accuracy measurements that quantify the degree of alignment between LLM-generated classifications and human coding. The experiment included 25 iterations (3,100 records in total coded by LLMs). Our findings demonstrate that both LLMs achieve strong base performance (&gt;70\\% validity) that could be further improved through calibration (reaching up to 90.32\\% validity), with diminishing returns after approximately 15 iterations. The impact of weighting varies significantly by category and model, suggesting that selective application of weighting approaches may be optimal.

While social media empowers advocacy and the sharing of personal stories, it also raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding how vulnerable communities may become entangled in an economy of suffering, where their experiences of pain are validated and interpreted by stakeholders through a selective mechanism rooted in cultural codes and power dynamics. Moreover, systemic inequities render the suffering of marginalized groups, particularly those with intersecting identities, less visible and intensify the consequences of inadequate outreach. This creates a disparity where the suffering of those in more privileged positions is more readily recognized and addressed. The theoretical advancement lies in reconceptualizing the platformization of pain to include narrative resistance, highlighting that marginalized groups actively contest and reshape suffering narratives rather than passively experience them. This expanded framework also deepens the concept of an economy of suffering by integrating hermeneutical injustice, which emphasizes how power dynamics shape not only the visibility of suffering but also the interpretive frameworks that validate certain narratives while marginalizing others.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wnsmz_v3","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/wnsmz_v3","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4168,"specialized":false,"preprint":true}]
