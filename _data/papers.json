However, women remain consequential actors in conflicts. Drawing on gendered understandings of conflict, we argue that mobilization is shaped by gendered homophily within social networks. We theorize that both men and women are likely to mobilize with individuals of the same gender. However, this effect is more pronounced for women due to differences in how men and women are mobilized for conflict as well as other forms of political engagement. To test this argument, we utilize data from the 1994 genocide that targeted Tutsi in Rwanda. Using network analysis, we demonstrate the pivotal role women played in mobilizing other women to commit violence. This article broadens our understanding of network dynamics in conflict and emphasizes the importance of gendered differences in mobilization patterns for political processes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70007", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70007", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.017987893004695277}, {"title": "The electoral politics of immigration and crime", "authors": "Jeyhun Alizade", "abstract": "Concern that immigration worsens crime problems is prevalent across Western publics.

I demonstrate this voter–party mismatch using survey data from 14 Western European countries linked with expert ratings of party positions. A panel survey from Germany further shows that concern about immigrant crime increases vote intention for the center right among voters of the Greens—the party of leftist cosmopolitans. A conjoint experiment among German voters replicates this defection effect and shows that it persists even if the center right stigmatizes immigrants or adopts conservative sociocultural issue positions.

Across two survey experiments and in-depth interviews, I find that exclusion from official identity categories triggers the experience of categorization threat, a psychological response rarely linked to political behavior. When MENA Americans experience categorization threat, they respond by expressing opinions on politics in ways that attempt to signal and assert their MENA identity and, to a lesser extent, Person of Color (POC) identity. Such identity assertion demonstrates that bureaucratic categorization influences expressions of public opinion on politics, not simply how people self-categorize.

Voting in partisan contests can be explained by voter’s national partisanship, consistent with existing literature.

National partisanship explains more than 80% of the within-contest variation in voting for partisan state and local offices but less than 10% for local nonpartisan contests and local ballot measures.

This article introduces an original dataset of precolonial African states in the nineteenth century to explain this seeming contradiction. By developing a typology of precolonial statehood, I show that there is no single legacy of the precolonial past. Rather, statehood only increases civil conflict where political power was highly concentrated in a polity. Where political authority was more diverse, conflict prevalence is lower.

Previous research offers mixed conclusions, in part, because of a focus on national legislatures where the introduction of cameras occurs only once.

However, commanders’ biases also created a desire to preserve white lives. Accordingly, we expect Black soldiers received worse support. These choices shaped soldiers’ risk of death. Analyzing the case of World War I (WWI), we leverage data on over 44,000 infantry fatalities and show that white units incurred four times as many combat fatalities as comparable Black units.

Instead, they promote risk-averse, femonationalist stances. While having a woman leader increases attention to gender-based violence, a higher share of women MPs has no impact on either the salience of or position on women’s interests.

Institutional ambiguity in an authoritarian administrative hierarchy may undermine this monopoly, allowing centralization reforms to mitigate information distortion.

Focusing on parties as the main gatekeepers to parliament, we analyse how the class background of political candidates influences the chances of being nominated in electorally safer positions. Based on original data on MPs’ backgrounds and the German GLES Candidate Study, we show that candidates with a working-class background have lower chances to be placed in safe positions, especially in center-right parties. Careerists, in contrast, enjoy systematic advantages in the nomination process, at least in left-wing parties. Lacking individual resources is thus not the only obstacle to working-class representation, but political parties are important actors in shaping the class composition of parliaments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676525100017", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676525100017", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006939687390211335}, {"title": "Voter perceptions and the politics of hidden costs in unilateral sustainable supply chain regulations", "authors": "Dennis Kolcava, E.

We assess the latter argument with original survey data and experiments with representative samples from the twelve major OECD importing economies ( N = 24,000). Indeed, citizens expect substantive benefits while discounting costs from these new regulations, resulting in majority support for rather stringent standards. We further observe that these relationships are muted in countries with high trade exposure.

Furthermore, we find that voters who expect their preferred formateur candidate to lose behave similarly to those uncertain about the outcome – and still engage in formateur optimization.

Surveying 1,185 representatives across 13 Western countries, we examine the educational attainment and social class of their parents, partner, and two closest friends.

To answer this question, this article investigates the banning of far-right groups in Germany, the archetype of ‘militant democracy’, where there are laws and institutions that protect a state’s democratic order through selective and qualified restrictions of certain political rights. The study draws on data about far-right organisations mentioned in federal security agency reports since 1990. Two-step fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) reveals that situations of high far-right visibility are necessary to take banning action. Within such situations, there are four sufficient combinations of organisational conditions that lead to banning action: Germany has imposed bans on neo-Nazi groups, longstanding organisational hubs in the far-right scene, aggressive militant organisations, and neo-Nazi sham parties. Two follow-on case studies identify related causal mechanisms underlying these sufficiency patterns. The article shows that Germany’s militant democracy practices are not applied as a matter of principle to every far-right organisation susceptible to a ban, but rather are used more pragmatically. This pragmatic approach implies that state actors should be especially attentive to the efficacy of using bans to disrupt and diminish extremist threats.

Expanding the classical Pitkinian model, it enables representatives to be better informed about how to address peoples’ concerns. In doing so, it advances the notion of dynamic political representation, where the represented are not passive principals but active partners in decision-making. While we uphold the classical principle of acting in the interests of the represented, we reconceptualise these interests as dynamic and continuously evolving – a perspective consistent with constructivist thought.

Bias perceptions are more common among citizens with more political interest, lower levels of education and income, and ideologically extreme positions.

Extreme rightists were more rigid than extreme leftists in 60% of the significant quadratic relationships.

For some residents, it was perceived as a symbol of coercion and intrusion; for others, especially in moments of uncertainty, it evoked feelings of nostalgia and a sense of security. In response to public sentiment, grassroots administrators began to adapt their communication strategies—modifying language, adding emotional resonance, and embedding elements of cultural identity—to reduce dissatisfaction and foster cooperation. These adaptive practices illustrate a transformation in the socio-technical imaginary of the loudspeaker, from a unidirectional instrument of regulation to a more dynamic medium of interaction.

Such fragmentation is not solely driven by economic forces or technological development and instead is understood along explicitly political lines. Second, we observe the rise of polarised platform polities.

Third, we observe a general shift from connective to protective forms of sociality, where users approach social media as if they are constantly in the presence of adversaries, and the ‘weak ties’ that once defined a web of opportunities are replaced by an assumed toxicity of ties.

Our research builds on literature exploring TikTok’s affordances and digital fashion culture, focusing on how women of color use the application to challenge aesthetic assimilation and celebrate ethnocultural identity. Using critical technocultural discourse analysis (CTDA) and digital ethnography, we analyzed 63 TikTok videos to explore how audiovisual features (e.g., audio, hashtags, and comments) enable marginalized creators to challenge western aesthetic dominance. The findings reveal that women of color strategically use TikTok to construct a subaltern digital commons, celebrating ethnic pride while fostering solidarity across diaspora communities. These creators promote cross-cultural engagement by inviting non-ethnic viewers to learn about and respectfully engage with their cultures on their terms. This study expands on studies of digital fashion culture to show how TikTok’s outfit transition trend functions as an online space to resist Eurocentric beauty standards while centering non-white femininities and cultural aesthetics.

In biomedical settings this is often addressed by using short-term outcomes as so-called “surrogates” for the outcome of interest, e.g., tumor size as a surrogate for mortality in cancer studies. We build on this literature by combining multiple, possibly qualitatively distinct, short-term outcomes (e.g., short-run earnings and employment indicators) systematically into a “surrogate index.” Under the Prentice surrogacy assumption, which requires that the primary outcome is independent of the treatment conditional on the surrogates, we show that the average treatment effect on the surrogate index equals the treatment effect on the long-term outcome. We also relate the surrogacy assumption to a set of structural, causal assumptions. We then characterize the bias that arises from violations of each of the key assumptions, and we provide simple methods to validate these assumptions using additional observed outcomes. We apply our method to analyze the long-term impacts of a multi-site job training experiment in California. Rather than waiting a full nine years to directly observe the long-term impact, we show that it is possible to use short-term (the first six quarters) outcomes as surrogates.

I document that (1) cities with higher price growth experienced larger polarization and increase in inequality since 1980 and (2) middle-income households migrate more often to cheaper locations for housing-related reasons than low- or high-income households.

Transitions from student to other statuses (whether temporary, dependent, or permanent) are associated with improved employment conditions, though the extent varies by destination status.

Given the diversity of international migrants and the complexity of their motivations, this article employs the meta-theoretical framework with estimated data on 5-year bilateral migration flows from 1990 to 2020. This article presents the evolving pattern of China's international migration, compares its immigration and emigration, and identifies their influential factors. China's international migration is growing comparably fast in the world with respect to number and proportion, with deceleration on net emigrant rate. China's international migration is spatially heterogeneous, experiencing declining long-lasting favorable bidirectional connection with Asian countries and increasing preferences for more developed Western countries. Small countries with historical Chinese diaspora communities maintain intensive migration links with China. The numbers of immigrants and emigrants are highly positively correlated owing to their similar influence of economic, development, cultural, religious, or political factors.

This pattern is driven by industry specialization, especially in construction, which creates dense local labour markets and offers wage premiums.

In contrast, the sex ratio of the Tokyo metropolitan area, which includes the capital in Japan, is relatively high compared to other areas within the country, suggesting male‐dominant migration towards that area. However, there were contradictory patterns of recent migration, such as selective migration of women to metropolitan areas and a larger net in‐migration of women to metropolitan areas than men. This can be interpreted to mean that the role of internal migration changed from increasing the sex ratio of metropolitan areas through ‘masculinisation’ to decreasing it through ‘feminisation.’ This study investigates the changes in migration patterns and their impact on the regional sex ratio in Japan using macro‐level data. It first shows the distinctive feature of high sex ratios of inter‐prefectural migrants and migration rates from 1958 to the present. The sex ratio increased until approximately 1990 and decreased thereafter. Subsequently, gender differences in education and employment were summarised as factors related to migration patterns by sex. These differences have gradually become smaller. Finally, this study quantifies the impact of inter‐prefectural migration on prefectural sex ratios using four decennial censuses from 1990 to 2020. The results indicated that the impact of migration changed from ‘masculinisation’ to ‘feminisation’ of the Tokyo metropolitan area and vice versa in the case of nonmetropolitan areas in about 2010. This suggests that the migration patterns in Japan have gradually resembled those of Western countries over the past three decades.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70108", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70108", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9699389960405815}, {"title": "Educational Spaces and Student Mobility: Transiting the Peripheries of the Barcelona Metropolitan Area", "authors": "Andreu Termes, Joan Checa", "abstract": "This paper presents a quantitative case study of student mobility in post‐compulsory secondary education—including both academic and vocational tracks—within the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA) between 2019 and 2022. The study investigates the relationship between the territorial distribution of school places, student home‐to‐school mobility, and the configuration of educational spaces. The theoretical framework combines two main approaches: critical geography and structuralism, drawing respectively on the works of Doreen Massey and Pierre Bourdieu. Using quantitative techniques and a comprehensive census database of over 200,000 students, our findings suggest that educational spaces in the BMA are articulated around three key variables: school provision (public, private), educational tracks (academic, vocational), and educational spaces (central Barcelona, elite suburbs, working‐class enclaves). Our analysis—employing, among other techniques, Cramér's V to assess the strength of associations between variables—underscores the socially embedded nature of mobility, which is deeply intertwined with forms of economic and cultural capital. This is reflected in the stark contrast between the mobility patterns of middle‐ and upper‐class students—who display high levels of mobility, particularly through centralisation towards Barcelona and suburban trajectories—and those of working‐class students, whose mobility is more limited and primarily confined to inter‐peripheral movements. The paper concludes with a discussion of the theoretical and political implications of these findings, particularly in relation to territorial justice and educational equity—considering, for example, the effects of school choice policies and neighbourhood‐based inequalities.

We find that the higher the flexible work hours, the stronger the fertility intention of women of childbearing age. After excluding the influence of fertility policies, addressing endogeneity issues, and conducting robustness tests in different ways, this conclusion is still supported. Mechanism analysis indicates that flexible work is beneficial in alleviating women's work‐family conflicts, improving individual job satisfaction and life happiness, and thereby promoting an increase in fertility willingness. Heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of flexible work on fertility intention mainly affects groups engaged in the tertiary industry, state‐owned enterprises, full‐time employment, middle‐ and high‐income earners, married, and those with fertility experience.

This study takes advantage of a full sample of 53,733 ethnic‐minority labour migrants from X County in China to examine how co‐ethnic networks impact ethnic minority's migration destination choice, and how these impacts vary with migrants' labour mobility. Our findings reveal two key insights: First, migrants are more likely to choose destinations with a large co‐ethnic network compared to migrants from the same region but with different ethnic backgrounds. Second, migrants with disadvantaged attributes, who typically exhibit lower labour mobility, tend to show a stronger preference for destinations with large co‐ethnic communities.

We find that recent and previous health declines are not triggering moves towards intergenerational co‐residence, but acute health events, functional limitation and worsened frailty are associated with transitions to home‐based care for parents and non‐parents alike. Additionally, previous health declines have a stronger influence on most residential transitions compared to recent health declines across parental status, suggesting that it takes time for health decline to induce residential mobility.

Following the LLFC's implementation, the average number of years of education among the next generation in affected areas increased by 5.08%, and the likelihood of children from primary‐educated families completing tertiary education increased by 4.28%. In addition to improved education outcomes, the LLFC led to higher annual incomes and a significantly greater probability of individuals becoming technicians and managers. Two main mechanisms explain the LLFC's effect on intergenerational mobility: upbringing awareness transition and increased returns on human capital, with the former playing a more prominent role.

Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall.

It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated ( r g = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles.

Our findings indicated that both OXT and AVP significantly enhanced pain empathy compared to placebo, with overlapping yet distinct neurofunctional and genetic modulation patterns. Specially, both neuropeptides engaged a shared perception-cognition-emotion network, including frontal regions, the insula, superior temporal sulcus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Crucially, they exhibited divergent mechanistic profiles: OXT preferentially influenced resting-state connectivity and perceptional-visual processing areas, while AVP exerted stronger modulation on perceptional-execution circuits. These differential effects aligned with their unique receptor expression patterns and interactions with distinct genetic systems. By delineating how OXT and AVP shape the multidimensional nature of social pain empathy, our findings provide a neurobiological framework for understanding these processes and offer potential pathways for targeted interventions in social cognition disorders.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2520651122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2520651122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01815710475435095}, {"title": "The distinctive innovation patterns and network embeddedness of scientific prizewinners", "authors": "Chaolin Tian, Yurui Huang, Ching Jin, Yifang Ma, Brian Uzzi", "abstract": "Science prizes purportedly reward innovation and explorations of new phenomena.

We argue that integrating pluralistic values requires a relational biodiversity economics that transcends people–nature dualism and seeks the flourishing of life. We synthesize foundations for such a paradigm in relation to worldviews, values, value indicators, and life frames.

To help bridge these gaps, in this article we draw on an “organizational perspective” to argue that “good enough” regulatory approaches should be directly informed by an understanding of how and why such crimes or offending behaviors are organized in the ways they are, and of the factors that shape these dynamics over time within particular contexts. We argue for the development of a program of research that synthesizes abstract and concrete research inquiry, and that challenges regulation academics to identify the necessary and contingent structures, mechanisms, and conditions that combine to produce white‐collar and corporate rule‐breaking behaviors to develop more plausible regulatory interventions, on a spectrum from immediate to long‐lasting.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70083", "doi": "10.1111/rego.70083", "journal_full": "Regulation & Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008073081292383488}, {"title": "The Cultural Devaluation of Feminized Work: The Evolution of U.S. Occupational Prestige and Gender Typing in Linguistic Representations, 1900 to 2019", "authors": "Wenhao Jiang", "abstract": "Previous research on occupational devaluation typically evaluates the potential wage declines associated with a significant inflow of women into an occupation; results have been mixed. Few studies, however, examine the cultural mechanism central to the thesis, where an occupation’s symbolic value in multiple dimensions changes in response to the dynamics of its cultural association with women. This article proposes a new semantic approach to trace the devaluation process in U.S. culture, where occupation titles appear in scholarly and public discourses with varied semantic proximity to gender- and prestige-signaling phrases over time. Decade-specific occupation embedding (1900 to 2019) from 127 billion words of American English across genres and a novel fixed-effects estimator show a latent cultural bias against women’s work, such that an occupation’s general prestige and perceived potency (but not its moral standing) declines when it becomes increasingly stereotyped as female. The largest penalties are found in lower- and middle-wage occupations; most high-wage occupations, despite experiencing large increases in female share in recent years, are persistently stereotyped as male professions without a prestige loss. In total, the cultural mechanism of devaluation accounts for 22.4 to 25.9 percent of the observed negative link between occupations’ female typing and hourly wages.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251362351", "doi": "10.1177/00031224251362351", "journal_full": "American Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.04139927442950131}, {"title": "The affective landscapes of the Swedish far right", "authors": "Ryan Switzer", "abstract": "This article ethnographically charts the emotional relations to place which run through the Swedish far right social movement—theorized as an affective landscape.

This so-called integration paradox may be caused by two basic, mutually independent mechanisms: highly educated immigrants (1) more often experience unmet migration expectations, and (2) show stronger negative reactions when their expectations about their life abroad are not met. Existing research mainly focused on the first mechanism, while empirically tracing the second has been hampered by a lack of evidence comparing less- and more-educated immigrants over time. Here, we address this gap and examine how unmet migration expectations contribute to education-related differences in destination attachment. The mechanism we investigate is rooted in the educational background, but migration amplifies the dynamics, contributing to higher hopes while confronting individuals with unpredictable realities and limited control. Using panel data on recent immigrants to Switzerland from the Swiss Migration-Mobility Survey (N = 5242 immigrants and 13,890 observations, 2016–2022), we assessed the extent of unmet expectations and associated disappointment through a question on dissatisfaction with the decision to migrate. Consistent with theory, we found that increasingly negative evaluations of the migration decision were linked to reduced destination attachment, especially for immigrants with higher levels of education.

Thus, the analysis shows that there is greater economic concentration in a single city, such as the capital, which is responsible for the political and economic decisions of the other regions. Centralised countries also have less capacity for economic transformation, due to the lack of fiscal decentralisation, which should in fact promote greater tax revenue collection. On the other hand, the approach also analyses lower political participation and exclusive democracy regions at lower subnational levels with less capacity for democratic participation. On the other hand, the analysis effectively shows that most federated countries, their states and municipalities, through fiscal decentralisation, promote greater economic transformation and greater democratic plurality.

Specifically, I combine comparative survey data on workers’ subjective technological vulnerability with indicators of objective industry-level AI exposure and find a U-shaped pattern among higher educated workers: There is high perceived vulnerability in some “traditional” automation-exposed sectors (e.g., manufacturing) but also in a group of strongly AI-exposed white-collar industries (finance, real estate, IT), with a remaining pocket of low vulnerability in strongly interpersonal sectors (e.g., education, healthcare).

Previous studies tracing exposure have overlooked measuring encounters with such seemingly innocuous content that is reframed to serve specific narratives. Networked exposure captures this second-order dynamic, highlighting how weaponized material makes its way down to the information diets of a broader audience. We measure networked exposure by combining individual-level browsing and survey data from a Swiss and German sample of users (N = 864), with an aggregate-level dataset of over 21 million URLs shared across Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Telegram, Vkontakte, and Gab. At the content level, weaponized material often followed extremist narratives and were shared by known conspiracy actors. At the individual level, participants often encountered this content through social media redirects and consumed it alongside hyperpartisan, alternative, and conspiracy (HAC) content. At the attitudinal level, networked exposure predicted political attitudes even after accounting for direct exposure to HAC media.

We develop a theory of distributive politics that incorporates the full range of congressional messaging on federal spending. Using an online survey experiment, we find that constituents are receptive to protection and commiseration messages. In fact, protection and commiseration messages are no less effective than traditional credit claims and announcement messages, respectively. These findings suggest distributive politics is about more than displaying influence; it provides legislators with a window for recognizing constituent needs, even in the absence of positive policy outcomes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u289j_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/u289j_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005263563152534401}, {"title": "The Rise and Trajectory of Taiwan’s Ko Wen-je: An Online Perspective", "authors": "kerry liu", "abstract": "The rise and trajectory of Ko Wen-je, the founding chairman of Taiwan People’s Party, a significant minority in the Legislative Yuan, is spectacular.

This paper develops a framework of regenerative governance, combining Meadows’ leverage points, Ostrom’s commons, and post-growth ethics, to analyze enterprises as micro-governance experiments in sustainability transitions. Using four cases, a US family farm, Dutch start-up, UK cooperative, and an Ecuadorian cacao partnership, we examine how organizational forms intervene at systemic levels by redesigning rules, feedbacks, and paradigms. Cross-case analysis shows that family and partnership models often catalyze paradigm shifts, while cooperatives and entrepreneurial networks codify rules and incentives at scale. Together, they illustrate regenerative enterprises as “living laboratories” of ethical innovation, embedding fairness, stewardship, and resilience into governance. The paper contributes by: (1) integrating systems, commons, and post-growth theory into an operational governance lens; (2) demonstrating how organizational forms activate distinct leverage points; and (3) advancing practice-oriented propositions for testing regenerative governance in food systems. By positioning regenerative enterprises as governance innovations, the paper reframes business strategy not only as value creation but as systemic intervention, with implications for sustainable business models.

While both risk-taking and social risk management have been widely studied, less attention has been given to how these two processes are linked—specifically, how risk-taking itself may be shaped by social networks. We test the \"social capital buffer\" hypothesis, which posits that greater social connectedness promotes risk-taking by buffering against negative outcomes. Analyzing social networks and risk preferences among 140 individuals in rural Bangladesh whose livelihoods range from farming to wage labor and small-scale trade, we identify distinct pathways through which social capital influences risk preference. Highly clustered individuals in financial support networks exhibit greater risk preference, suggesting that clustering facilitates risk-taking by ensuring resource circulation within a tight-knit group. In contrast, individuals with more support-receiving ties in material support networks are more risk-averse, indicating that material support functions as informal social insurance reducing reliance on risky decisions. Finally, reciprocity in material support networks promotes risk-taking only among wealthier individuals, highlighting how individual economic resources interact with social capital to shape risk-taking.

The analysis shows that Nigeria, for example, has a fiscal base in only a few states, with 10 states naturally having greater capacity for economic transformation, which suggests that there is less complexity in tax revenue collection, thus restricting economic development particularly in these states. Political decentralisation in African federalist countries does in fact lead to greater political turnover and greater political plurality among its political actors, which are naturally the political parties.

However, it also changed the value of citizenship wherein immigrants who may have been found citizenship least desirable decided to become a citizen more quickly given various alienage penalties. To understand how naturalization unfolded under these new conditions, this paper draws on a new hand-coded sample from a novel dataset of declaration of intent to naturalize forms and petition to naturalize forms to the 1920, 1930, and 1940 censuses. We then incorporate hand-coded information uniquely available in the naturalization documents, such as detailed place of birth, height, and complexion.

Results for socio-emotional development are less robust, and physical health appears not to be correlated with HEU, possibly due to comprehensive healthcare.

In line with the family investment and the family stress models, income and parental investment in cognitively-enhancing activities mediate the link with cognitive development, whereas parental stress mediates the association with socio-emotional development.

This expansion has altered the demographics of multiple job holders, shifting from predominantly low-wage workers seeking economic survival to include professionals across the income spectrum pursuing varied employment arrangements. Exploration of MJH has typically been dichotomized into two perspectives: those who view it as an unfortunate necessity forced upon the economically vulnerable and those who celebrate it as empowering \"side hustles\" that provide supplemental income and personal fulfillment. To examine workers' actual preferences and motivations, we fielded a survey (n=254) investigating whether workers actively desire MJH arrangements, whether financial considerations alone drive these preferences, and what other factors influence their appeal. Results revealed that workers across demographic groups express a genuine preference for MJH arrangements, transcending economic boundaries. While compensation remains important, workers value MJH for the flexibility and autonomy it provides. In contrast to the universal appeal of these characteristics, the youngest generation (Gen Z) is distinguished by significantly higher interest in using multiple roles to maintain different professional identities and build diverse networks (p &lt; 0.05).

Using data on individuals born between 1955 and 1987 across 15 Western European countries, I characterize mobility transitions using three types of “effects” from a topological model: class hierarchy, class inheritance, and status affinity. To capture the potential influence of income inequality on mobility decisions at different life stages, I measure it at the secondary school choice (age 15), during the school-to-work transition (ages 15-25), and during the primary working age (ages 25-55). The results indicate that greater income inequality is associated with more limited vertical mobility between the salariat and the working class and stronger inheritance propensity among individuals from the high salariat and entrepreneurial families, especially when measuring income inequality during the primary working age.

Drawing on Triandis and Gelfand's (1998) framework, and focusing specifically on educational contexts, we propose the Belongingness through Cultural Value Alignment (BCVA) model, whereby belong-ingness serves as a catalyst between cultural value orientations and technology engagement, with vertical collec-tivism deriving belongingness primarily through structured skill development and validation while horizontal collectivism focusing instead on belonging based on community integration. When technological environments value practices that are consistent with vertical collectivist norms, individuals from horizontal collectivist cultures may experience cultural misalignment not from disinterest in technology or exclusionary efforts but, instead, because dominant engagement modes conflict with their familiar frameworks for fostering a sense of belonging. By examining how cultural value orientations mediate the sense of belonging in contexts involving modern tech-nologies, the proposed perspective offers a novel framework for understanding why access alone may have proven insufficient to address technological participation gaps, and suggests directions for creating technology spaces where individuals from a wider range of communities can experience the authentic sense of belonging.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn8fg_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wn8fg_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.042500259964931786}, {"title": "Linguistic Rights and the Borders of Political identity", "authors": "Giacomo Lemoli", "abstract": "Language policy is focal in the relations between states and ethnolinguistic minorities, yet empirical evidence on its political effects is limited.

I examine the 1986 linguistic reform in the Spanish province of Navarre, which divided the territory into three zones with different levels of normalization of the Basque language. Using Difference-in-Differences and Regression Discontinuity designs across zones, I find that the introduction of bilingualism in public institutions did not significantly alter Basque nationalist mobilization in the short run. However, support for Basque parties diverged markedly across zones from the late 2000s, suggesting that intergenerational identity realignments and the end of political violence by ETA catalyzed political change over the medium to long run. Consistent with this interpretation, the reform led to an increase in the share of candidates with Basque names in local elections. Overall, the reform appears to have affected political behavior and the making of social boundaries between linguistic groups by widening the constituency of voters with Basque identities rather than changing the behavior of pre-existing Basque speakers.

By allowing party weights to vary with covariates describing their interrelationships, the model enables researchers to examine the interdependent nature of coalition outcomes.

This paper brings together interviews with UK clinicians with scholarship on STI/HIV health promotion to consider how emergent use of DoxyPEP plays into the making of queer AMS. I demonstrate how clinicians establish links between microbiome health and generalised antibiotic consumption to construct AMS principles. Based on these principles, I consider what a queer AMS might look like for GBMSM, including social and ethical procedures for assembling safer sexual practices and deterring onward transmission of bacterial STIs (Davis et al. 2022). Building upon Davis et al.’s (2022) work, I argue that the assemblage of normative and non-normative use of DoxyPEP constitutes queer AMS through the negotiation of what I call a ‘threshold of acceptable STI transmission’. Attending to this threshold might allow healthcare practitioners to stay with social complexity (Law 2004; Haraway 2016) and multiply engage with sexual communities (Epstein 2022) to cultivate queer AMS. Finally, when sufficiently contextualised and localised within larger debates about AMR, queer AMS can enable new understandings of how GBMSM actively understand and/or contest biomedical power through negotiated safer sex practices.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8k3xc_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8k3xc_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.025426315715123105}, {"title": "Neurobiological Preconditions for Effective Discipline: A Model of Forgiveness and Permanence", "authors": "Christopher Sylvain", "abstract": "Discipline has traditionally been approached as external enforcement, yet coercion and punishment rarely yield lasting transformation.

Forgiveness collapses conflict into coherence through anterior cingulate cortex (ACC)–prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulation of amygdala-driven hostility, while permanence consolidates forgiveness into enduring relational stability. Together, these processes produce discipline as an emergent property of resolution and stabilization rather than fear or control. Drawing on neuroscience, psychology, and resilience research, the model predicts that forgiveness without permanence leads to fragility, permanence without forgiveness results in brittleness, and only their integration generates sustainable order. Applications span clinical psychology, education, criminal justice, and public health, offering testable hypotheses for neuroimaging and longitudinal research.

This paper interrogates how sustainability has been framed into a narrow construct of carbon neutrality, deterring considerations about broader ecological and social consequences. It will use a review of international frameworks, corporate commitments, and specific examples to illustrate the ways in which sustainability often operates as a rhetorical and branding device disconnected from a genuine concern for planetary health. The analysis employed policy papers, corporate announcements, independent watchdog and scholarly outputs as sources and was triangulated on analytical case study practices. Three case studies were selected as illustrative examples as each reflected patterns of interest. Carbon offsetting is heralded as a solution to the climate crisis; in practice carbon offset projects often validate land dispossession and alienation, harm ecosystems, and exacerbate pollution through mitigation claims of neutrality. The Indian Railways' introduction of kulhad cups shown as an example of the process of \"symbolic\" policy wherein environmental costs are displaced as new costs emerge where the value of ecological virtue is claimed. The 'traceability' of the commodity chains of cobalt and lithium demonstrates the deliberate obfuscation of brands taking little, if any responsibility for the human and environmental costs of the so–called green transition. The evidence implies that sustainability is now less a universal ecological principle and more a curated agenda for political legitimacy and corporate profit. Greenwashing, reliance on offsets, ignorance of Scope 3 emissions, and reliance on interventions that are yet to be proven as technically feasible, are a few standard tactics that disguise the ecological damage.

We develop a novel conceptual framework, using an inductive saturation approach to review literature published between 2000 and 2023 and workshops with multi-disciplinary researchers and experts. Our framework comprises three overlapping domains: assessing the possibility of becoming pregnant; interpreting signs and symptoms of a (potential) pregnancy; and opportunities for pregnancy confirmation. The framework includes an individual’s trajectory to recognising a pregnancy, recognising there is no pregnancy following suspicion there may be, and not recognising a pregnancy that could be recognised through other means (e.g. using biomedical testing). It is inclusive of diverse conceptualisations of what constitutes a pregnancy. Within these intersecting domains, we map factors influencing trajectories operating at micro, meso, and macro levels, identifying the connections between individuals, communities, policies, health systems and institutional structures. While pregnancy duration is linear, time manifests in different ways across an individual’s trajectory. Individuals might experience one or all the domains of pregnancy recognition, different factors within those domains, and may encounter them in differing order.

In light of this, we present a theory of external arming that conceptualizes arms transfers not simply as material capability boosts, but also as carriers of information and as relational linkages to arms suppliers. We develop several hypotheses positing external arming and conflict to be linked both negatively and positively, depending on whether recipients gain new information from arms transfers and on the nature of the suppliers. Empirical tests using additive and multiplicative effects network models and data from the Interwar years, a historical period where our information-based theory of external arming is particularly applicable, provide support for these expectations.

This study examined how professional identity, cognitive appraisals, and perceptions of fairness shape judges’ openness to AI. Research Questions: Five questions guided the study: (1) Do different message framings (role enhancement, efficiency, neutral) influence judges’ trust, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and adoption intentions? (2) How do professional identity and prior experience with technology and AI shape evaluations and willingness to adopt AI? (3) How are procedural justice, legitimacy, and trust interrelated in predicting adoption? (4) Do judges differ in their levels of trust across legal contexts? (5) What concerns or reflections do judges express about AI in courtroom decision-making? Method: A national sample of 317 judges (56.6% male, 41.1% female; M age = 60.41, SD = 10.24; 80.2% White, 8.4% Black, 3.4% Hispanic/Latinx, 2.7% Asian, 1.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.9% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander) was recruited through the National Judicial College. Judges were randomly assigned to one of three message framings. Measures included professional identity, trust in AI across eight legal contexts, perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes, procedural justice, legitimacy, and adoption intentions. Results: Role-enhancement framing significantly increased trust (η² = .02), perceived usefulness (η² = .06), and adoption intentions (η² = .04). Mediation analyses indicated that procedural justice predicted adoption indirectly through legitimacy and trust (indirect effect = .08, 95% CI [.05, .10]). Prior AI experience was the strongest predictor across outcomes (e.g., trust: β = .10, p &lt; .001; adoption: β = .37, p &lt; .001). Judges expressed higher trust in AI for research and educational tasks than for sentencing, bail, or parole.

The realism of these modeling assumptions has not yet been investigated. To start filling this gap, we investigated experiences of poverty through the lens of the DTM, using two complementary approaches: a pre-registered online survey with British participants (n = 300) and semi-structured qualitative interviews with very low-income individuals in France (n = 14). Our results imply that basic needs have both a context-general component and context-specific elaborations. Furthermore, participants often relied on social and institutional resources when experiencing financial adversity, indicating that only measuring personal income or wealth might not accurately capture the resources available to people. With respect to the DTM’s main predictions, most individuals close to—but still above—the desperation threshold exhibited caution and took a safety-first approach, consistent with risk-averse behavior.

The latter can be interpreted both as an initial ‘deficiency’ of first creation (in the long term, as an eschatological catastrophe), and as a result of purposeful (not fully thought out?) activity of the demiurge. On the basis of an analysis of a number of cosmogonic and etiological myths, it is suggested that crisis in mythic logic proves to be one of the forms of overcoming chaos, which can however give rise to a ‘second-order’ crisis and even a ‘pendular’ crisis (when each phase of overcoming the current crisis gives rise to a new crisis). The condition of ‘cosmic imbalance’ is illustrated by myths about the pacification of ‘solar chaos’, which are widespread in world folklore. In a large number of regional versions of the myth, excessive heat (light) is the starting point of the story, which suggests that such a situation is admissible within the framework of ‘mythological logic’, and therefore, the point of reference in the construction of the story is not an initial state of equilibrium, but a certain crisis that needs to be resolved. The study (1) describes the transition from the original mythological ‘anti-norm’ to the ‘formula of the impossible’ of fairy tales; (2) examines certain object realizations of mythological representations linked to images of space and time.

Ao descrever LLMs com termos centrados no ser humano, como “engano” e “intenção”, o campo caracteriza erroneamente a tecnologia, levando a modelos de ameaça falhos e avaliações de segurança equivocadas. Primeiramente, desconstruo o LLM como um sistema matemático e estatístico, demonstrando como sua mímica convincente da cognição emerge do pareamento de padrões probabilísticos, não de uma compreensão genuína. Em seguida, estabeleço um limiar filosófico para a agência moral, sintetizando as perspectivas Humeana, Kantiana e fenomenológica, argumentando que a agência requer sentimento afetivo, autonomia racional e experiência subjetiva e temporal — todos ausentes nos LLMs. Usando um referencial junguiano, reinterpreto estudos sobre IA “enganosa” e “maquinadora” não como descobertas de malícia emergente, mas como manifestações da projeção de nossa própria “Sombra” sobre um artefato tecnológico opaco. Essa má interpretação leva a narrativas perigosas e quase mitológicas de risco de IA, exemplificadas por relatórios como 'AI 2027'. Em sentido alternativo, proponho um paradigma fundamentado para o alinhamento que desloca o foco da malícia semelhante à humana para modos de falha não-humanos.

These results identify segmentation as a methodological rather than a purely technical issue, shaping both human and automated tagging outcomes.

Silverwood", "abstract": "Background: Analyses of sequential mixed-mode survey data can be biased due to non-random selection of participants into mode. Understanding the consequence of this bias requires knowledge of the predictors of mode selection. However, research on these predictors is sparse, in contrast with research on the predictors of survey non-response. The ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response predicts that delayed responders – who, in sequential mixed-mode surveys, appear in later offered modes – and non-responders share similar characteristics. If the model, which is testable in longitudinal data, is correct, this would suggest that research on non-response could be generalized to understand mode selection. Methods: We used data from a major UK birth cohort study (the 1958 National Child Development Study) which embedded a sequential web-then-telephone mixed-mode survey at the age 55y sweep to assess whether (a) descriptively, late (i.e. telephone) and non-responders share similar characteristics and (b) whether predictions from models of non-response are accurate when used to predict telephone response. For (a), we calculated univariate descriptive statistics and performed cluster analysis to compare an array of participant characteristics across response groups (web, telephone and non-response). For (b), we estimated random forest models for non-response and telephone response (conditional on response) and compared two metrics of predictive accuracy (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUC ROC] and Brier scores) when using the non-response model to instead predict telephone response, against predictions from the model generated for telephone response, specifically. Results: Telephone and non-respondents were similar on almost all (measured) characteristics, and dissimilar in most regards to web respondents. Predictions from non-response models had similar predictive accuracy to predictions from models trained on telephone response, specifically – for instance, AUC ROC values in hold-out samples not used to train models of 0.72 (95% CI = 0.70, 0.74) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.72, 0.75), respectively. Conclusions: The characteristics of late- and non-responders in a sequential (web-then-telephone) mixed-mode survey were very similar, consistent with the ‘continuum of resistance’ model of survey response. This suggests that research on non-response could transport to understanding mode selection in sequential mixed-mode surveys, though replications in other surveys with different mixed-mode designs (e.g., modes adopted and their order) is required.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/df4c5_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/df4c5_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01178947785986062}, {"title": "Exploring the Potential of Digital Games for Climate Action Education", "authors": "André Czauderna", "abstract": "This article examines why digital games may be particularly well-suited to fostering deeper understanding and critical reflection on climate action, while addressing their inherent limitations.

This paper has two aims: It is a guide to some of the latest methods in double robust, flexible covariate adjustment using machine learning, and it tests them against more traditional statistical methods and flexible \"single robust\" methods using simulated, cross-sectional data where the treatment effect is known. Double robust methods covered include Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting (AIPW), Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation (TMLE), and Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML). Results suggest that these methods do outperform traditional methods in a wide range of simulations, but only when paired with flexible machine learning estimators. Notably, G-computation with the same flexible estimators obtains almost identical results, and standard regression methods have only slightly higher bias.

Based on 11 in-depth interviews with different stakeholders, two “balancing acts” emerged.

However, the impact of these pressures on the domestic publishing infrastructures of semi-peripheral nations remains underexplored. This paper investigates how a nation’s domestic publishing infrastructure shapes whether new, high-volume open-access publishing models function as a portfolio addition or a systemic substitute. Using a comparative mixed-methods analysis of Spain and Lithuania, we combine bibliometric data from the Web of Science (2004–2024) with 28 semi-structured interviews with researchers. The findings reveal two divergent, rational strategies. In Spain, a resilient domestic publishing infrastructure, accommodated by a flexible evaluation system, allowed researchers to adopt new publishers as a pragmatic portfolio addition to an already diverse set of options. In stark contrast, Lithuanian research assessment policies actively marginalised domestic journals, creating acute strain on the country’s publishing ecosystem. Researchers in Lithuania thus adopted these same new publishing models as a systemic substitute and a survival measure. We conclude that control over a community-managed domestic publishing infrastructure is a key factor shaping the autonomy of a national academic system. It is this infrastructure that separates a strategy of dependent displacement from one of autonomous coexistence: a crucial lesson for policymakers engaged in global research assessment reforms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ucgzm_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ucgzm_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.016666991449112323}, {"title": "The development of translation studies as a discipline", "authors": "Dariia Davydova, Elena Starodumova", "abstract": "The article provides a detailed commentary on the development of Western translation thought in the late 20th century, from a subdivision of contrastive linguistics into an independent, dynamically developing discipline within the humanities (translation studies). The author analyzes the theoretical and philosophical preconditions for the change in the scientific and academic status of translation within the Western academic field, the main milestones and key figures of this process. After having summarized the most important theoretical shifts that took place in Western translation thought at the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, the author comes to the conclusion that since the late 1970s the development paths of Western and Russian translation studies have diverged. In Western translation studies, after the ‘cultural turn’, the concept of ‘neutral’ translation is abandoned in favor of a new politicized view of translation as a tool for shaping cultural identities. The translator, who in the linguistic model was relegated to the modest role of a technical assistant, is seen in the culturally oriented paradigm as a co-author, a fully-fledged subject of political dialogue, capable of resisting the usurpation and ethnocentrism of their own culture. The new Western translation ethics is largely determined by the call to resist the dominants of the target culture and not be afraid of open political activism.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf6ud_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vf6ud_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.11524239576148287}, {"title": "Extra-Liminality: Anthropological Insights into Resilience and Adaptation in Hostile Sociopolitical and Digital Environments", "authors": "Dominique Ryder", "abstract": "This study identifies a new emerging phenomenon centered on non-dominant narratives: extra-liminality.

These methodologies are essential to allow immersive experiential engagement and, as such, are both radical and experimental in their form.

However, understanding of how these actors interact with the institutions and infrastructure systems in which they are embedded to drive change is still limited. An interdisciplinary approach is needed to understand factors shaping actors' political behavior and how power dynamics influence their ability to create change. This study addresses this gap by combining analysis of actors' narratives about water issues and governance with dynamical systems modeling of the socio-hydrologic system in the context of California's San Joaquin Valley. Through interviews and focus groups with growers, advocacy groups, and rural residents, distinct narratives emerge around water issues and power dynamics. Modeling strategies that would maximize each actor's water access reveals that existing structures incentivize strategies that would mainly benefit larger growers, and thus conflict with the goals of environmental justice narratives. Comparing these modeled strategies with actors' actual strategies also reveals disparities in different actors' ability to pursue the \"optimal\" strategy.

While it has theoretical advantages over other non‑probabilistic methods, there is limited empirical evidence on the accuracy of its estimators when benchmarked against complete population data. Methods: We conducted a GPS‑verified, smartphone‑based RDS survey in York, England, in September–October 2024. The target sample size was 800 residents aged 16 or over; 807 eligible responses were obtained from six recruitment seeds over up to 44 waves. The survey collected demographic, socio‑economic, and health information aligned with the 2021 Census, along with personal network size and some network composition data. RDS‑I, RDS‑II, and Successive Sampling estimators were applied, and results were compared with Census 2021 benchmarks. Results: For many variables, RDS estimates diverged markedly from census values, and 95% confidence intervals often failed to include the true value. Deviations from the at‑random recruitment assumption were evident, particularly for sex and ethnicity, and appeared to be a major source of bias. Incorporating self‑reported network composition reduced bias in the estimate of the variable for which network composition information was collected. Conclusions: In this real‑world test, standard RDS estimators did not produce consistently accurate estimates. Violations of the random recruitment assumption were a likely cause. Network composition‑based estimation offers a promising alternative but requires further testing and methodological refinement.
