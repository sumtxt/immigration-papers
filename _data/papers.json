[{"title":"Commerce, coalitions, and global value chains: Coordinated and collective lobbying on trade","authors":"Hao Zhang","abstract":"Global value chains (GVCs) have connected firms in complex networks within and across national borders. However, political economy models often assume away production linkages and thus fail to explain pervasive and diverse trade coalitions cutting across industries and firms. I develop a GVC‐centered framework where production linkages through a common foreign partner foster interdependent preferences and collective action for trade liberalization. For empirical tests, I compile firm‐to‐firm supply chain networks, construct direct measures, and estimate various network models. I find that US firms with GVC linkages tend to lobby together, lobby on the same bill, and hire the same lobbyist. Furthermore, GVC linkages among lead firms increase collective lobbying through trade associations. Finally, I show that GVC linkages predict the formation and depth of preferential trade networks. These results provide microfoundations for new coalitional politics under GVCs and challenge the common assumption about industries and firms as isolated political actors.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12987","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12987","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4267,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Representation increases women's influence in climate deliberations: Evidence from community‐managed forests in Malawi","authors":"Amanda Clayton, Boniface Dulani, Katrina Kosec, Amanda Lea Robinson","abstract":"Women's inclusion is now the norm in global and local initiatives to combat climate change. We examine how women's representation affects climate deliberations using the case of community‐managed forests in Malawi. We run a lab‐in‐the‐field experiment randomly varying the gender composition of six‐member groups asked to deliberate on policies to combat local overharvesting. We find that any given woman has relatively more influence in group deliberations when women make up a larger share of the group, a change driven by men's assessments of women's influence. Women's presence also shifts the content of deliberations toward prospective solutions for which women have socially recognized expertise (cooking and replanting). Despite these changes, women and men do not prefer different deforestation policies, and women's presence does not meaningfully affect group decisions. Our work demonstrates how women's presence shapes climate deliberations but also calls into question claims that women's inclusion will necessarily affect climate decisions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12994","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12994","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4045,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"A model of policy timing: Hedging, pandering, and gambling","authors":"Daniel Gibbs","abstract":"I study a political agency model where a reelection‐seeking politician chooses when to make policy and a voter learns about the politician's competence from its timing, substance, and outcome. It takes time for the politician to receive information about which policy is in the voter's best interest and for the effect of policy to be observed. Due to perverse electoral incentives, politicians engage in three behaviors that limit electoral accountability. First, politicians hedge by delaying policy to hide potential policy failure from voters. Second, politicians pander late in the electoral cycle where they cannot credibly campaign on the success of an unpopular policy. Third, in the hope of producing visible policy success, politicians gamble by making a prompt policy choice when it is in the voter's best interest to delay.

We test this argument by compiling a novel dataset of Paraguayan family networks that we link to families who illegally benefited from public land grants from 1954 to 2007.

Would state legislatures function differently if voters had access to more information about legislative politics? Leveraging the haphazard overlap of newspaper markets and legislative districts, I construct and validate a measure of legislative press coverage in all 49 partisan state legislatures for the years 2000–2022 that is plausibly uncorrelated with other district-level variables. Drawing on this large-scale dataset, this article traces the impact of press coverage on state legislative voters, elections, and, ultimately, representation. I find that robust local press coverage substantially augments down-ballot voter engagement, the electoral return to ideological moderation, and the incumbency advantage. Once in office, I further document that state legislators who receive stronger press coverage work more for their constituencies and diverge less from their district’s median voter. Overall, these results suggest that state legislators would be more moderate, representative, and productive were local press coverage strengthened.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s000305542500022x","doi":"10.1017/s000305542500022x","journal_full":"American Political Science Review","dist":0.4393,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Unconditional Loyalty: The Survival of Minority Autocracies","authors":"SALAM ALSAADI","abstract":"Contrary to the conventional view that minority regimes are vulnerable to breakdown, many of these regimes exhibit remarkable durability. From 1900 to 2015, minority autocracies that exclude a single majority ethnic group (e.g., regimes in Bahrain, Syria, and Apartheid South Africa) remained in power twice as long as other autocracies. This article argues that this durability is rooted in their unique ethno-political configuration, which enables them to foster a largely unconditional loyalty due to the ruling minority’s fear of being subjected to majoritarian rule. Such loyalty endows them with an exceptional capacity to withstand major challenges by fostering in-group demobilization and policing, pro-regime countermobilization, and coethnic elite loyalty. This article employs a multi-method approach, using a novel dataset of minority regimes and a case study of Bahrain based on original interviews.

Alternatively, when authoritarian elites form well-organized parties in proximity to democratization, democratic-era party institutionalization of all parties increases. Second, post-transition party institutionalization is positively related to the degree of institutionalization of parties under autocracy.

To answer this question, we assemble a novel panel of housing-related petitions to the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and all housing constructed between 1945 and 1989. Exploiting the timing of the largest housing program in 1971, we employ a difference-in-differences approach to show that construction was targeted at regions with higher rates of petitioning.

We contend that nonviolent and violent strategies impose distinct costs on security forces—related to repression, fighting, and exit—which shape the likelihood of different forms of disloyalty. Our findings reveal that nonviolent campaigns are more likely to trigger large-scale loyalty shifts, but their effects are confined to specific types of disloyalty. Specifically, nonviolent strategies increase the likelihood of shirking, vocal support for opposition campaigns or criticism of the regime, and withdrawal of regime support.

I use a dictionary‐based method to measure the concreteness of parliamentary speeches in the European Parliament's plenary (2009–2019). The results show that when public opinion is divided, legislators reduce the concreteness of their speeches if they concern matters that are salient to the citizens. In contrast, when speaking on policies that have a higher relative importance to their parties, they use more concrete language even in the face of a divided public.

Experimental Evidence from 5G Antenna Placement in Switzerland","authors":"Lukas Rudolph, Franziska Quoß, Thomas Bernauer","abstract":"Supplying society-wide public goods often depends on site-specific provision. Yet, (perceived) localized provision costs may at times outweigh localized individual benefits and thus lead to “not-in-my-backyard” (NIMBY-)opposition (e.g., when trying to set up energy, transportation, social, or, in our case, communication infrastructure). Accurate estimation of the level of NIMBY-opposition per se is analytically challenging because general attitudes towards provision and NIMBY-motivated opposition are intertwined but need to be distinguished and because site selection can be endogenous to local support/opposition. We conducted an experiment that addresses these challenges, focusing on public attitudes toward 5G antenna placement in Switzerland. Using original data from a population-representative sample of Swiss residents ( $$N=5,035$$ ), we observe a population split on the question of 5G network expansion. We survey-experimentally revealed actual 5G antenna locations around respondent homes to a sample largely unaware of these locations beforehand. This information increased individuals’ worry over proximity to antenna sites and reduced support for 5G rollout, with such effects becoming stronger with closer proximity. Differentiating respondents with ex ante higher perceived costs/lower perceived benefits and lower costs/higher benefits from provision, the former are more opposed to 5G rollout, regardless of distance. In contrast, the latter exhibit particularly pronounced NIMBY attitudes. This allows for unexpected political coalitions that, in our case, could affect majority support. In additional experiments, we show that NIMBY attitudes translate into a higher willingness to pay for opposition in close proximity to new provision sites—but this could potentially be mitigated by scenarios where citizens decide under a veil of ignorance.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10047-1","doi":"10.1007/s11109-025-10047-1","journal_full":"Political Behavior","dist":0.507,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"With All Due Respect: Respectability Politics and Black Support for Police Defunding and Abolition","authors":"Alexander I.

First, we closely examine six countries that have shifted from majoritarian or proportional systems to mixed systems to assess the impact on women’s representation in parliaments. To ensure that changes in women’s representation are not merely a result of global trends, we compare each country’s share of women in parliament with a country of similar culture and the same initial electoral system, but where the electoral system has not changed. Second, we conduct a large global crossnational comparison using multivariate regressions to examine the broader effects of adopting mixed systems.

The difference in modern-day economic freedom associated with being colonized by the freest colonizer instead of the least free implies a predicted increase in modern-day per capita income of up to US$10,000.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01282-5","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01282-5","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.4372,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Manuscript Referees, 2024","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf023","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf023","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.3013,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Linking artificial intelligence job exposure to expectations: Understanding AI losers, winners, and their political preferences","authors":"Jane Green, Zack Grant, Geoffrey Evans, Gaetano Inglese","abstract":"The rapid expansion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workplace has significant political implications. How can we understand perceptions of both personal job risks and opportunities, given each may affect political attitudes differently? We use an original, representative survey from Great Britain to reveal; (i) the degree to which people expect personal AI-based occupational risks versus opportunities, (ii) how much this perceived exposure corresponds to variation in existing expert-derived occupational AI-exposure measures; (iii) the social groups who expect to be AI winners and AI losers; and (iv) how personal AI expectations are associated with demand for different political policies. We find that over 1-in-3 British workers anticipate being an AI winner (10%) or loser (24%) and, while expectations correlate with classifications of occupational exposure, factors like education, gender, age, and employment sector also matter. Politically, both self-anticipated AI winners and losers show similar support for redistribution, but they differ on investment in education and training as well as on immigration. Our findings emphasise the importance of considering subjective winners and losers of AI; these patterns cannot be explained by existing occupational classifications of AI exposure.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251337897","doi":"10.1177/20531680251337897","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.5579,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Activist disciplines: Universities in autocracies and political protest","authors":"Nils B Weidmann, Mina Rulis","abstract":"Recent events on university campuses show again that academic institutions often constitute breeding grounds for political mobilization. This also applies to autocratic countries, where political protest has been found to be more likely to occur in university cities. However, research so far has failed to address the question of which universities are more likely to see protest. In this paper, we focus on the disciplinary composition of universities in autocracies. We argue that non-STEM disciplines traditionally attract more progressive students, cover more politically sensitive topics, and oftentimes study the determinants of successful mobilization. Therefore, they should be more likely to serve as focal points for political protest. We test our expectations in a large-scale comparative analysis, using fine-grained data on the composition and location of academic institutions in autocracies combined with event data on political protest. We find that political activism is more likely in cities with institutions focused on arts and humanities, which points to the potentially transformative role of these disciplines even in severely constrained political settings.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251335647","doi":"10.1177/20531680251335647","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.4988,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Crossing the District Line: Border Mismatch and Targeted Redistribution","authors":"Allison Stashko","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/736999","doi":"10.1086/736999","journal_full":"The Journal of Politics","dist":0.5576,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Fundraising Events and Non-Ideological Donation Motivations","authors":"Sean Kates, Sebastian Thieme","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/736996","doi":"10.1086/736996","journal_full":"The Journal of Politics","dist":0.4144,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Universal Mail Ballot Delivery Boosts Turnout: The Causal Effects of Sending Mail Ballots to All Registered Voters","authors":"R.

Exploring Adolescents’ Daily Exposure to Appearance Content on Social Media and Its Relations with Body Image Components","authors":"Chelly Maes, Robyn Vanherle, Jasmine Fardouly, Laura Vandenbosch","abstract":"When using social media, adolescents encounter various types of appearance-related content. Yet, no research has explored how daily exposure to such types of content, including idealized content, body positivity (BoPo) content, and a mixture of both, links to adolescents’ body image states. With the present 14-day daily diary study among French adolescents ( N = 108, 1,434 daily assessments, M age = 15.99, 64.8% girls), we examined how exposure to idealized appearance content and BoPo content predicts adolescents’ state body satisfaction and surveillance on the same day and the next day. More so, we explored how the relationships may vary depending on a co-occurrence of exposure to both content types (i.e., mixed exposure). At a between-person level, exposure to idealized appearance and BoPo content was linked to higher body surveillance. At the within-level, BoPo content was associated with higher body satisfaction, meaning that on days that adolescents saw more BoPo content than usual (compared to their own means), they were also more satisfied with their bodies. However, these relations did not last until the following day. No other within-person level relations emerged. Also, when exploring the impact of the interaction between exposure to BoPo and idealized content, non-significant results emerged. The findings highlight the complexity of adolescents’ interactions with social media and emphasize the importance of future research adopting an ecological approach. This should involve considering both intra-individual and inter-individual factors, as well as the diverse types of social media exposure.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00936502251338901","doi":"10.1177/00936502251338901","journal_full":"Communication Research","dist":0.4087,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Source-Inconsistent News From Partisan Media: Expectancy Violations as a Way to Improve Attitudes Toward Out-Party Media","authors":"Masahiro Yamamoto, Chia-Heng Chang","abstract":"Drawing on Expectancy Violation Theory (EVT), we predict that news content that is inconsistent with out-party media’s ideological stance forms a positive expectancy violation and thus leads partisans to view these outlets more favorably.

While these models highlight the shift from industrial production to Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-driven growth, they remain rooted in Western-centric modernization paradigms, assuming linear pathways to future progress, the efficiency of technocratic governance, and historical as well as institutional path-dependencies. These models, however, neglect the various “indeterminacies” of postcolonial development, overlooking how spatial asymmetries, historical contingencies, and socio-political contestations at multiple levels continually shape technological transformations across different societies. Challenging these normative assumptions, this article advances a Critical Postcolonial Political Economy (CPPE) approach, synthesizing insights from critical political economy, postcolonial and pluralist economic geographies. The CPPE approach centers on three analytical lenses: first, “social blocs” or the shifting coalitions of state, capital, civil, and political society actors that variously impact technological development and change; second, “plural temporalities” that reveal the non-linear, overlapping tempi of technology politics and development within national contexts; and third, “conjunctural thinking,” which parses technological transformations through moments of contestation, crises, and agency. Rather than prescribing yet another developmental blueprint, the CPPE approach seeks to demonstrate a decolonizing methodological praxis, disrupting grand global and regional narratives such as the “Asian miracle” and “Asian Century” that themselves universalize specific technological pathways to developmental ascendancy. Through situated histories and contested socio-technical transitions, the CPPE approach outlines a more politically generative lens for interrogating growth models across “incomparable geographies.” Ultimately, the article calls for rethinking technological leapfrogging beyond teleological assumptions, centering postcolonial indeterminacy in analyses of Asia’s (uneven) digital development.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251341790","doi":"10.1177/20563051251341790","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4041,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Regionality of Messaging Applications: Everyday Socialization as a Gateway to Civic and Political Participation in China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States","authors":"Xiaomei Sun, Xining Liao, Hernando Rojas","abstract":"Although there is a growing number of studies examining the political significance of messaging applications, the regional aspects of messaging applications have been overlooked by many in a global market dominated by American digital platforms. This study proposes an analytical framework of regionality concerning the characteristics of digital platforms, including origin, development, and usage. Messaging applications that are defined as regional have their origin, development, and usage occurring within a single country. This study takes a comparative approach to understand the social and political behaviors on regional messaging applications, including WeChat in China, LINE in Japan, KakaoTalk in South Korea, and WhatsApp and/or Snapchat in the United States. Using an online survey distributed in the four countries, we find that everyday socialization is a determining factor in political conversations on regional messaging applications, which in turn leads to civic and political participation. This mediation effect is confirmed in China, Japan, and South Korea, not in the United States.

Used as both a rhetorical weapon and an object of genuine concern, various understandings of hate speech circulate within interactive everyday cultures of digital media, shaped by the digitalised media environment. With the combination of computational and qualititative research methods, this article explores the struggle over meanings of hate speech. From a large dataset of 289,933 messages, we identified the 10 most relevant themes. We further used articulation theory to analyze different political and social articulations of hate speech. We situate these articulations to the context of post-truth condition, characterized with crisis of trust and truth-telling. Our study identified articulations of confusion, uncertainty, ridicule, trivialization, and censorship in the context of hate speech. The results show that the struggle over the power to define hate speech simultaneously involves a struggle to overturn the definitional power of research institutions and official and knowledge authorities. Overall, the study contributes to the research on hate speech by showing the vernacular, contextual and localized nature of hate speech that emerges in reference to particular political actors, events and debates. Furthermore, the study illustrates the societal importance of the hate speech debate and the ways in which the concept itself, through multiple articulations, is used as tool in the post-truth battle to impede and disturb democratic debate and to serve particular political ends.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251341794","doi":"10.1177/20563051251341794","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4379,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Market in the Fragmented State: Alibaba and the Chinese Governance Regime of Big Tech","authors":"Lin Zhang","abstract":"This article maps China’s emerging governance regime of big tech firms in the 2020s through the case of Alibaba. Contesting dominant media narratives that frame the Chinese state as either clashing with or aligning with private platforms, it provides an alternative perspective rooted in Chinese political traditions, based on long-term ethnographic observations and industry analysis, and informed by changing global sociotechnical and geopolitical conditions. In this hybrid model, the pragmatic Leninist central state both leverages and controls private tech giants to balance economic growth, social stability, and national security amid geopolitical tensions and a slowing economy. Local governments, meanwhile, maintain a fragile symbiosis with platforms like Alibaba to advance their own political and economic goals. This “market in the fragmented state” contrasts with the current oligarchical U.S. model, where big tech firms often capture state power to serve corporate interests. Despite their monopolistic and infrastructural tendencies, Chinese platforms operate within a fragmented, state-dominated system that both enables and restrains their growth, depending on shifting political dynamics. Understanding this emerging governance regime diversifies the current conceptualization of state market relations globally and state governance of big techs beyond Silicon Valley. It also sheds light on China’s ongoing techno-driven restructuring and global expansion and prompts questions about the influence of geopolitical competition on China’s governance approach and its global implications.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251340147","doi":"10.1177/20563051251340147","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.372,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"“Boom-and-Burst”: Linking Online and Offline Elements of Right-Wing “Patriotic” Camps in Brazil","authors":"Fernanda Odilla","abstract":"This article examines social media’s role in the “online-offline nexus,” focusing on how digital interactions translate into sustained, large-scale, right-wing protests. Using Brazil as a case study, the research combines document analysis with non-participant observation in open right-wing Telegram groups and participant observation at the largest of Brazil’s 100 protest camps. At this camp in Brasília, supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro, as in many other cities, gathered for 70 days between 2022 and 2023 to protest the 2022 presidential election won by Lula da Silva. The camps and online groups prominently displayed nationalist symbols and similar slogans such as “Stolen Election”, “SOS Armed Forces” and “Save Brazil,” reflecting the unified ideology of the self-called “patriots.” Social media—mainly through the (re)circulation of videos, posts, and dedicated content produced by and to demonstrators in Telegram and WhatsApp groups—proved essential in four stages: mobilizing , organizing , sustaining , and reorganizing . Introducing the concept of “boom-and-burst,” this study shows how the online-offline nexus both fostered collective identity and facilitated the logistical and ideological underpinnings of prolonged, site-specific demonstrations, actively encouraging violence. In Brazil, the overt support of many state actors, especially the army and police, also played a role. The cycle of intense digital enthusiasm translated into protest camps and, instead of the expected bust, ultimately escalated into acts of violence, with demonstrators planning bombings and vandalizing institutional sites in a disturbing sequel to the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251343866","doi":"10.1177/20563051251343866","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4691,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Clapping Back on TikTok: Black-Asian Multiraciality and Humor","authors":"Ayumi Matsuda-Rivero","abstract":"TikTok has become an important digital space for solidarity among underrepresented groups.

I analyzed 56 videos, 47 by Blasian creators and nine by non-Blasian creators, using content analysis and Berger’s typology of 45 humor techniques to uncover common themes and strategies employed by Blasians and non-Blasians on TikTok. Three major findings emerged from the data: First, unlike most social media platforms, the majority of my sample was created by Blasians themselves, with more than half of these videos directly or indirectly referencing racist experiences the creator had encountered using techniques like facetiousness, stereotypes, and wordplay suggesting that a Blasian-specific culture is emerging on TikTok, mirroring elements of Black Twitter. Second, Blasians often relied on monoracial Black and monoracial Asian stereotypes in their videos, demonstrating the multiple dimensions of how they are targeted. Third, non-Blasians relied on Blasian-specific stereotypes, highlighting novel ways in which other minoritized racial groups are racializing Blasians.

Due to TikTok’s distinctive technical structure, scholars have argued that processes of sociality and identity construction have changed, calling into question some of the founding principles of how we understand identity performance on social media. In this article, we critically engage with these debates by asking how identity is performed in TikTok content in the context of health and illness. Specifically, we explore identity performance in content on two hereditary cancer conditions: BReast CAncer (BRCA) and Lynch Syndrome, carriers of which have a much higher disposition to getting certain types of cancer in their lifetime. Through using computational data collection tools and conducting a qualitative content analysis, we find that identity is performed through the enactment of roles, all of which demonstrate how TikTok’s features still enable interpersonal and networked elements of self to emerge. This article contributes to knowledge on experiences of social media and hereditary cancer by shedding light on the kinds of identity performance that become most visible through ways of sociality shaped by powerful multimodal and algorithmic platforms such as TikTok. In so doing, it also provides unprecedented insight into what content users are exposed to when seeking information and support in relation to a hereditary cancer diagnosis on TikTok.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251340862","doi":"10.1177/20563051251340862","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.3566,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Candidates Be Posting: Multi-Platform Strategies and Partisan Preferences in the 2022 U.S. Midterm Elections","authors":"Josephine Lukito, Maggie Macdonald, Bin Chen, Megan A.

Knowledge overestimation may then lead users to communicate more frequently about climate change with others. We test these hypotheses with a four-wave panel survey of respondents aged 18–29 years. We find that social media exposure is positively associated with respondents’ tendencies to overestimate their knowledge about climate change, but we do not find causal effects. Overestimation is also related to perceived information overload, subjective digital literacy, and trust in social media comments. While overestimation did not cause higher outspokenness about climate change, it increased respondents’ efforts to persuade others and engage with politicians. These results have implications for science communication and education.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251341792","doi":"10.1177/20563051251341792","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4004,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Doing What Is Right: Role of Social Media Users in Resilience to Disinformation","authors":"Karolína Bieliková, Alena Pospíšil Macková, Martina Novotná","abstract":"Resilience to disinformation on social media relies on the user’s ability to critically assess disinformation and even counter it. Active users, who, with their actions, can curate the information environment of others, can play a crucial role in stopping the dissemination of disinformation. Their activities, such as correcting or reporting, in the decentralized social media environment may prove more effective than institutional responses. Considering this, the study looks specifically at how active users engage with disinformation. Through 60 semi-structured interviews over 3 years, we explore how crises like COVID-19 and the Russia–Ukraine war impact Czech users’ motivations and strategies. Findings indicate that users are driven by a moral obligation to provide accurate information. Both people sharing and correcting disinformation believe in their critical skills, with their desire to help amplified by crises. However, the ones correcting often face frustration and demotivation due to hostile interactions and a lack of visible impact, while the ones sharing remain persistent. Strategies are influenced by the perceptions of the individuals and the type of disinformation. Completely false information is often ignored as not worth debunking, whereas partially false information prompts active correction due to the perceived ease of rebuttal. The study highlights the need for social media platforms to support users in corrective actions and address algorithmic issues that may impede these efforts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251342223","doi":"10.1177/20563051251342223","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.3973,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Balancing Acts: Communicating Legitimacy in Global Speech Governance","authors":"Diyi Liu","abstract":"The governance of online speech is increasingly a battleground shaped by competing social expectations. This study investigates TikTok’s content moderation in Indonesia and Pakistan, two countries with vast market potential and delicate social and moral stances. Through document analysis and in-depth interviews with government officials, industry representatives, and civil society experts, it examines how stakeholders navigate normative and pragmatic considerations in global speech governance. The findings first highlight distinct regulatory approaches: Indonesia’s collaborative yet paternalistic model preferring fines over bans. It emphasizes administrative compliance through jurisdictional control over platform rules. In contrast, Pakistan’s defensive stance prioritizes infrastructure-level monitoring and restrictions, often resorting to platform bans to enforce control over moral and religious content. Unlike its Silicon Valley counterparts, TikTok demonstrates strategic compliance, deliberately sidestepping controversy by delegating sensitive decisions to state authorities and avoiding political roles. While normative consensus on appropriate content remains elusive, civil society organizations mediate crucial accountability relationships through strategic activism, coalition-building, and international networks. The study discusses the tensions and cost-benefit appraisals of each actor group, identifies essential principles for legitimate speech governance, and examines challenges in translating these principles into actionable frameworks.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251340855","doi":"10.1177/20563051251340855","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4253,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Shifting tides: How public perceptions of GPT regulation evolved before and after GPT-4 on Quora","authors":"Yipeng Xi, Luu Thuc Ngan Mai","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103001","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103001","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.3567,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Social media access and purposeful use in China: Geospatial patterns and socioeconomic and COVID-19 influences","authors":"James B.

Equilibrium effects are important: the first 5000 MWh of storage capacity would reduce wholesale electricity prices by 5.6%, but an increase from 25,000 to 50,000 MWh would only reduce these prices by 2.6%. Large‐scale batteries will reduce revenues to both dispatchable generators and renewable energy sources. The equilibrium effects lead battery adoption to be virtually non‐existent until 2030, without a storage mandate or subsidy.

We interpret culture as a repertoire, consisting of (cultural) attributes and allowing rich cultural responses to political changes. Combinations of attributes produce cultural configurations, which provide social meaning, coordination, and political justification. Our framework has several distinctive features. First, it proposes a “systems approach” to culture: the meaning and function of attributes are determined within the whole configuration and political equilibrium. Second, it emphasizes discontinuous or “saltational” changes in culture—rather than gradual, evolutionary changes—as attributes are reconnected and acquire new meanings in response to evolving circumstances and as outcomes in ongoing “cultural struggles.” Third, our framework puts the spotlight on how fluidly different cultures can respond to conditions, depending on the nature of their attributes and constraints on their connections. Finally, it enriches the study of the codetermination of political, institutional and cultural outcomes.

It examines economic shocks such as recessions, inflation, and trade shocks, alongside noneconomic shocks like migrations, wars, terrorist attacks, pandemics, and natural disasters. Key conclusions emerge: aggregate shocks influence political preferences, risk attitudes, and institutional trust; experiences during young adulthood have stronger, enduring impacts; and economic shocks generally shift preferences toward the political right, while noneconomic yield more varied outcomes depending on the context. The review also evaluates empirical methodologies, their limitations, and mechanisms underlying these effects. By analyzing how shocks alter societal values and behaviors across generations, this work provides insights into the long-term consequences of major disruptions on individual and collective decision-making.

Using nationally representative panel data, the analysis demonstrates that immigrants who acquire housing assets—whether through ownership or appreciation in property value—become less supportive of public provision directed at other foreign residents. While immigrants initially exhibit stronger support for state intervention, greater exposure to the housing market is associated with a growing perception that existing government support is adequate and a reduced inclination to endorse expanded immigrant-targeted spending. These shifts reflect not a uniform turn toward conservatism, but a reconfiguration of political attitudes shaped by economic security, social positioning, financial constraints, and the redrawing of intra-group boundaries. In South Korea’s asset-based welfare regime, housing functions not only as a source of private stability but also as a mechanism that mediates immigrants’ evolving relationship to the state and to other immigrant groups. By situating these dynamics within a non-Western context, this study contributes to broader debates on immigration, housing, and the stratifying effects of economic incorporation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00457-9","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00457-9","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.633,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"On the limits of antiracism: how antiracist opposition is connected to racism denial in Germany","authors":"Tae Jun Kim, Elias Steinhilper","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2508392","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2508392","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.4196,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Beyond puzzlement: rethinking Latino conservatives’ politics of race, ethnicity, and immigration in the Trump era","authors":"Roger S.

Across MNP from diverse backgrounds, family separation emerged as one of the most prominent themes. Family separations were closely related to families’ evolving degrees of agency, which shaped variation in separations’ anticipation and duration. Conceptualizing anticipation and duration as two intersecting continuums, in this article, we describe different types of MNP family separation, link these types to differences and changes in families’ perceived control over the migration process, and illustrate their distinct emotional and practical implications.

This study examines the impact of refugee exposure on local attitudes and migration policy preferences in the world's largest refugee-hosting country. Using an instrumental variables approach, the findings reveal that exposure significantly affects perceptions of economic burden, insecurity, social distance, and migration governance. Negative attitudes are primarily driven by relative deprivation, cultural alienation, and competition in labor markets and public services. While religiosity minimally affects attitudes, it fosters a more welcoming outlook. Consistent with the integration paradox hypothesis, increased interaction with refugees exacerbates cultural conflicts, framing refugees as a perceived threat to the host community’s culture.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf034","doi":"10.1093/jrs/feaf034","journal_full":"Journal of Refugee Studies","dist":0.755,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Corrections to “Determinants of Enforced Return: A Quantitative Analysis of the Spectrum of (In)voluntariness Among Rejected Asylum Seekers in the Netherlands”","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70051","doi":"10.1002/psp.70051","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5231,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"An Extension of Migration Effectiveness Indices: Accounting for the Impact of Migration on Population Structure","authors":"Sechang Kim, Sang‐Il Lee","abstract":"This study introduces the age‐weighted migration effectiveness index (AWMEI), a new metric that integrates age‐specific variation into a single measure of migration effectiveness. Traditional indices, such as the migration effectiveness index (MEI) and age‐specific MEI (ASMEI), effectively address the first aspect of migration effectiveness—population redistribution—but overlook the second aspect—transformation of the composition of regional populations. The AWMEI bridges this gap by weighting net migration flows according to their age structure, offering comprehensive insights into migration's dual impacts. Applied to South Korea's internal migration data (2001–2022), the AWMEI uncovers patterns previously obscured by conventional measures. Nationally, an increasing divergence between AWMEI and MEI reveals growing age disparities in migration patterns. At regional and local scales, the AWMEI highlights substantial age‐specific population shifts even where traditional indices indicate minimal migration effectiveness. Amid broader spatial demographic transitions, the AWMEI provides a robust analytical framework for capturing migration's demographic implications. Its inherent adaptability further allows broad application across diverse dimensions of population composition and various research contexts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70049","doi":"10.1002/psp.70049","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5188,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Moving Back and Forth: A Longitudinal Approach to Analyze Migration Trajectories","authors":"Hanzhi Hu","abstract":"Migration and its implications are key research topics in population studies.

Four migration trajectories were identified during the 10 years of observations, including migrant stayers, return migrants and circular migrants of different directions. Results illustrate their heterogeneities and educational consequences. The impact of one's migration trajectory on education is determined by the direction (to rural or to urban) of the transition and the accumulated effects of every transition.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70047","doi":"10.1002/psp.70047","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5242,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do Diaspora Engagement Policies Promote Loyal Ethnic Lobbying? Empirical Analysis of Turkey's Policies and the Lobbying Capacity of its Diaspora in Germany","authors":"Alfonso Giordano, Laura Sparascio","abstract":"This paper examines how sending governments engage their diasporas for lobbying purposes and the potential outcomes of such efforts. Using Turkey's diaspora in Germany as a case study, we apply an integrated framework combining insights from the diaspora engagement policies and ethnic lobbying literatures to address the question: To what extent is a sending country capable of mobilising its diaspora to lobby for its interests in the host country? We show that governments' policies can strengthen the diaspora lobbying capacity by enhancing the internal factors of ethnic lobbying success, such as political activity, unity, and collective identity. However, these efforts may provoke backlash from the host country, limiting the diaspora's access to political power and chances of successful lobbying. Moreover, when the group's interests diverge from the homeland's objectives, the diaspora may prioritise its own concerns, complicating states' efforts of mobilising a consistently loyal group. This study contributes to our understanding of state‐diaspora relations by highlighting how states attempt to promote diaspora's lobbying and the complexity of such actions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70052","doi":"10.1002/psp.70052","journal_full":"Population Space and Place","dist":0.5816,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"A call for psychological and behavioural science on degrowth","authors":"Dario Krpan, Frédéric Basso, Dallas O’Dell, Jason E.

Understanding where and how agricultural frontiers emerge is thus important. Yet, existing monitoring approaches typically focus on mapping deforestation and do not capture the shifts in land access and ownership that lay the ground for agricultural expansion, thereby missing early stages of frontier development. We develop an approach that captures these early dynamics and apply it to the entire 1,1 million km 2 of the Chaco, a global deforestation hotspot. Through the detection of linear features indicative of land claims and the analysis of their spatial–temporal dynamics, we reveal that the footprint of agricultural frontiers in the region extends far beyond that of deforestation. Most of the Chaco shows signs of land claiming, and although claiming activity is especially concentrated close to active deforestation, emergent claiming in remote parts of the Bolivian and Paraguayan Chaco indicates rapidly growing interest in land in these regions. Finally, the strong spatial correlation between land claiming and the disappearance of smallholder homesteads points to the social repercussions of early agricultural frontier expansion in the Chaco. By offering a transferable template to map land-control indicators at scale, our approach enables a better understanding of frontier processes and more accurate targeting of policy interventions in emerging agricultural frontiers globally.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2407916122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2407916122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4138,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Reply to Ogutu et al.: Cattle–wild herbivore interaction studies warrant new lenses from community ecology and environmental justice","authors":"Bilal Butt, Wenjing Xu","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2505717122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2505717122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.358,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Measuring historical pollution: Natural history collections as tools for public health and environmental justice research","authors":"Shane DuBay, Brian C.

Redressing the unequal distribution of environmental pollution is thus a question of environmental justice and public health that requires policy solutions. However, data on pollutants for many locations and time periods are limited because environmental monitoring is largely reactive—i.e., pollutants are monitored only after they are recognized as harmful and are circulating in the environment at elevated levels. Without comprehensive historical pollution data, it is difficult to understand the full, intergenerational consequences of pollutants on environmental and human health. We assert that biological specimens in natural history collections are an underutilized source of quantitative pollution data for tracking environmental pollutants over two centuries to inform justice-centered policy solutions. Specifically, we: 1) discuss the need for quantitative pollution data in environmental research and its implications for public health and policy, 2) examine the capacity of biological specimens as tools for tracking environmental pollutants through space and time, 3) present a framework for integrating pollution datasets from specimens with spatially and temporally matched human health datasets to inform and evaluate policy, and 4) identify challenges and research directions associated with the use of quantitative pollution datasets. Biological specimens present a unique opportunity to fill critical gaps that address environmental challenges relevant to public health and policy. This work demands interdisciplinary partnerships and inclusive practices to connect data generated from specimens with urgent questions about environmental health and justice.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2403781122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2403781122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3831,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The prevalence of functional limitations in the US workforce","authors":"Hailey Clark, Bastian Ravesteijn, Kathleen J.

The most common limitations were in upper body strength and torso range of motion, and with respect to the ambient environment. The study also found that mental illness, arthritis, and substance use disorder are associated with the greatest number of functional limitations in working adults. The findings have implications for economic performance, workforce planning, and social policies to support displaced and vulnerable workers with significant functional limitations.

Blei","abstract":"The rise of foundation models marks a paradigm shift in machine learning: instead of training specialized models from scratch, foundation models are trained on massive datasets before being adjusted or fine-tuned to make predictions on smaller datasets. Initially developed for text, foundation models have also excelled at making predictions about social science data. However, while many estimation problems in the social sciences use prediction as an intermediate step, they ultimately require different criteria for success. In this paper, we develop methods for fine-tuning foundation models to perform these estimation problems. We first characterize an omitted variable bias that can arise when a foundation model is fine-tuned in the standard way: to minimize predictive error. We then provide a set of conditions for fine-tuning under which estimates derived from a foundation model are n -consistent. Based on this theory, we develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this omitted variable bias. To demonstrate our ideas, we study gender wage gap estimation. Classical methods for estimating the adjusted wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages, which can induce omitted variable bias because they condition on coarse summaries of career history. Instead, we use a custom-built foundation model, capturing a richer representation of career history. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that career history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of career history that are omitted by standard models but are important for explaining the gap.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2427298122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2427298122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4517,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Why excluding regenerative grazing skews beef’s carbon profile","authors":"Nataliya Apanovich, Deseret Weeks","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2506941122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2506941122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.2401,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Fixing the US statistical infrastructure","authors":"Nancy Potok, Erica L.

Although the literature sheds light on the authorities' decision of when to provide feedback, less is known about firms' decisions on how to respond. Building on research on compliance and regulation, we expect a higher level of responsiveness to feedback when the financial capacity to cover short‐term costs is higher (as this allows firms to allocate resources for compliance in the current period) and when firms expect higher revenues for the upcoming period (as current non‐compliance represents the risk of a larger future loss). We also expect a conditional association: having a limited financial capacity may truncate the effect of positive expectations (inability to respond), and negative expectations may truncate the effect of having a sufficient financial capacity (lack of incentive to respond). To test these hypotheses, we examine anonymized financial and regulation‐related data of over 5500 financial intermediaries operating in the Netherlands during 2009 and 2010. The results of a series of tests indicate that the effects of financial capacity and revenue expectations are indeed distinct yet independent.

We use a hiring survey experiment with 335 German employers to explore possible explanations for these ‘sheepskin effects’, while addressing concerns about unobserved confounding in observational studies. Across 2680 hypothetical job applicants, employers were nearly 1.8 times more likely to invite graduates for an interview than otherwise identical non-completers and were also willing to pay graduates substantially higher starting salaries. Using a unique survey module on employers’ perceptions, we show that the average employer perceives degree-holders to outperform non-completers in terms of occupation-specific and non-cognitive skills but not in terms of general cognitive skills. These employer perceptions predict hypothetical hiring behaviour in that those who view graduates more favourably showed a stronger preference for this group in the survey experiment.

We draw on comprehensive Census data at consistent small-scale geographies to study segregation trajectories in 219 metropolitan areas since 1900. We update past research to show that total segregation in metropolitan areas peaked around 1960 and has now fallen below its 1930 level. Our major focus is on the spatial components of segregation. We show that two types of macro-segregation—increasing racial disparities between cities and their surrounding areas and rising segregation between communities within suburbia—became substantial only after 1950 and have remained at a similar level since 1960. At that time, micro-segregation (separation between neighborhoods in cities and in suburbia) had begun to fall. Multivariate analyses over time show how suburban fragmentation, socioeconomic differences between Black and white workers, and changes in the size of the Black population were associated with these trends in each component of segregation. The durability of segregation today is largely due to macro-segregation, which by 2020 accounts for nearly half of total metropolitan segregation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf069","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf069","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.5312,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Review of “Language Brokers: Children of Immigrants Translating Inequality and Belonging for their Families”","authors":"Stephanie L Canizales","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf051","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf051","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.4553,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Review of “Crisis by Design: Emergency Powers and Colonial Legality in Puerto Rico”","authors":"Joe Greener","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf064","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf064","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.3711,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Review of “Marriage Material: How an Enduring Institution is Changing Same-Sex Relationships”","authors":"Abigail Ocobock","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf072","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf072","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.3793,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Risk of exposure to COVID-19 and informal social control in Hong Kong: the mediating role of social cohesion","authors":"Donglin Zeng, Xiaogang Wu, Jia Miao","abstract":"Many strategies for preventing and containing the spread of COVID-19 require wide-scale public cooperation backed by informal social control.

This study compares the relative strength of two explanations for why. One contends that partisanship, as a group identity, may lead people to protest in support of their party’s interests. Another suggests that partisans may perceive a greater threat from the opposing party’s actions, leading them to protest more in response. Drawing from research on affective polarization, this study favors the threat-based explanation. Three studies of surveys fielded between 2014 and 2022 highlight the link between partisan animosity—or hostile feelings toward the opposing party—and protest participation. Studies 1 and 2 use panel data to show that citizens who hold greater partisan animosity at one point are more likely to report having protested in the years to follow. This effect is comparable to that of their concern about the issues being protested. Study 3 further shows that protest participation is more common in communities where partisan tensions run high. Meanwhile, across models, the individual-level effect of partisan identity on protest was null or negative. These findings point social movements researchers toward threat-based explanations of how partisanship motivates protest and highlight an additional dimension to the relationship between partisan animosity and political participation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf066","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf066","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.5433,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Quantifying Narrative Similarity Across Languages","authors":"Hannah Waight, Solomon Messing, Anton Shirikov, Margaret E.

This is a key measurement problem in sociological inquiry, from the study of how interest groups shape media discourse, to the spread of policy across institutions, to the diffusion of organizational structures and institution themselves. To study how ideas and narratives diffuse across text, we must first develop a method to identify whether texts share the same information and narratives, rather than the same broad themes or exact features. We propose a novel approach to measure this quantity of interest, which we call “narrative similarity,” by using large language models to distill texts to their core ideas and then compare the similarity of claims rather than of words, phrases, or sentences. The result is an estimand much closer to narrative similarity than what is possible with past relevant alternatives, including exact text reuse, which returns lexically similar documents; topic modeling, which returns topically similar documents; or an array of alternative approaches. We devise an approach to providing out-of-sample measures of performance (precision, recall, F1) and show that our approach outperforms relevant alternatives by a large margin. We apply our approach to an important case study: The spread of Russian claims about the development of a Ukrainian bioweapons program in U.S. mainstream and fringe news websites. While we focus on news in this application, our approach can be applied more broadly to the study of propaganda, misinformation, diffusion of policy and cultural objects, among other topics.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00491241251340080","doi":"10.1177/00491241251340080","journal_full":"Sociological Methods & Research","dist":0.4769,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Simulating Subjects: The Promise and Peril of Artificial Intelligence Stand-Ins for Social Agents and Interactions","authors":"Austin C.

Previous research has stratified the target population into subgroups defined by categories of auxiliary variables observed for the entire population, and tailored strategies to obtain similar response rates across subgroups. However, if the auxiliary variables are weakly correlated with the target survey variables, optimizing data collection for these subgroups may not reduce nonresponse bias and may actually increase the variance of survey estimates. In this paper, we propose a stratification method to identify subgroups by: (1) predicting values of target survey variables from auxiliary variables, and (2) forming subgroups with different response propensities based on the predicted values of target survey variables. By tailoring different data collection strategies to these subgroups, we can obtain a response set with less variation in response propensities across subgroups that are directly relevant to the target survey variables. Given this rationale, we also propose to measure nonresponse bias by the coefficient of variation of response propensities estimated from the predicted target survey variables. A case study using the Dutch Health Survey shows that the proposed stratification method generally produces less variation in response propensities with respect to the predicted target survey variables compared to traditional methods, thereby leading to a response set that better resembles the population.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00491241251345463","doi":"10.1177/00491241251345463","journal_full":"Sociological Methods & Research","dist":0.3854,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Causal Effect of Parent Occupation on Child Occupation: A Multivalued Treatment with Positivity Constraints","authors":"Ian Lundberg, Daniel Molitor, Jennie E.

On this basis, the paper is the first to advance and rigorously substantiate the theoretical proposition that democracy is the inevitable trajectory of institutional evolution.

Despite being declared ‘essential’ by many governments during the coronavirus pandemic, these workers are widely documented to face extremely poor working and living conditions, along with low wages. While existing literature has primarily focused on countries in southern Europe, this paper examines Germany’s agricultural sector as facing similar challenges in securing migrant workers’ rights. Around 300,000 migrant workers come to Germany each year for the harvest season, with most now arriving from Romania and Poland. We find that the employment of this workforce is driven by structural changes in Germany’s agricultural sector, the Europeanisation of migration policy, the deregulation of the German labour market, the proliferation of new employment categories, and the dominance of sectoral business interests in policymaking. The German case illustrates both the difficulty of regulating precarious, low-wage work in a sector traditionally weak in labour organising, and how the Europe-wide nature of the issue means that, without coordinated action by the labour movement across the EU, the ‘race to the bottom’ in this sector will continue.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8thxd_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/8thxd_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5257,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Disrupted landscapes and symbolic shifts: Land discourses in Ukrainian media after russia’s full-scale invasion","authors":"Alexander Vorbrugg, Myroslava Volosko, Grabovska Tetiana, Nataliia Miroshnyk, Kateryna Polianska","abstract":"Media play a central role in conveying what happens to land and ecosystems as they suffer war-induced disruptions when physical access is dangerous and restricted.

Counter to an extensive literature that emphasizes the contribution to conflict of ethno-religious polarization, we show that the sharp increase in pogroms after October 1905, when publication of the October Manifesto and accompanying anti-Semitic propaganda increased feelings of political threat among many non-Jews, was smaller in settlements with relatively large Jewish populations. We demonstrate that this empirical pattern can be rationalized with an elaborated version of the Esteban-Ray (2008) model of diversity and conflict when, as with the October Manifesto, political reform systematically alters the distribution of benefits across groups.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eakus_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/eakus_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5799,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Ethical Dilemmas in Smart Cities: Surveillance, Discrimination and Algorithmic Opacity","authors":"Marco Antônio Dias Barbosa, Hélder Castro Uzêda, Joberto S.

We address this debate using a large-scale “integrative” experiment that systematically varies levels of disagreement and political relevance across a diverse set of topics. While some discussion topics reduced affective polarization more than others, these differences were not explained by how “political” the topics were or how much participants disagreed.

Previous studies have focused on predicting whether protest events will take place or not, but they have not predicted the descriptive characteristics of these events. This gap might be attributed to a reliance on highly aggregated event data, which overlooks abrupt changes that can happen within individual days - such as a protester throwing a stone at a police officer. For this reason, this paper aims to forecast the escalation of protests on individual days and cities. To incorporate within-day dynamics into the prediction models, these dynamics are measured using protest images from social media. By applying computer vision techniques to these images, they can provide detailed estimates of the number of protesters, the tactics employed by the protesters, and the tactics opposed by law enforcement. This approach is demonstrated using a new dataset that includes 13 protest periods and 22,479 protest images. To validate the effectiveness of the new short-term indicators, the predictive performance of machine-learning models is compared against models that cannot draw on them. The results on the hold-out sample show that incorporating short-term dynamics improves the prediction of protest characteristics. While these improvements appear to be marginal, the approach reveals numerous opportunities for forecasting the escalation of protests, which has implications for their mitigation and prevention.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vh8at_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/vh8at_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4469,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Validation of the Index of Relative Rurality Against Contemporary USDA and Census Measures","authors":"Eashwar Krishna","abstract":"Defining and measuring rurality is a persistent challenge for researchers and policymakers. Threshold-based classifications often create artificial distinctions, failing to capture the continuous nature of the rural-urban spectrum. The Index of Relative Rurality (IRR) developed by Waldorff (2006) offers a continuous, multi-dimensional measure to address this shortcoming. This paper provides a contemporary validation of the IRR, testing a 2020 version of the index against the 2023 Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC), the 2024 Urban Influence Codes (UIC), and 2020 Decennial Census data on county-level rural population. Using ordered logistic regression, the IRR was found to be a highly statistically significant predictor of both RUCC and UIC classifications, explaining approximately 21% and 15% of their respective variances. Linear regression analysis revealed that the percentage of a county's rural population accounts for a substantial 57.4% of the variance in the multi-dimensional IRR score. These findings confirm that nearly two decades after its inception, the IRR remains a robust and relevant tool. It aligns closely with official governmental classifications while offering a more granular, multi-faceted perspective on rurality, underscoring its continued value for research and policy analysis.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8976b_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/8976b_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4437,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Heterogeneities of Immigrant Poverty in the U.S.","authors":"David Brady, Alexis Bocanegra, Diana Cervantes, Lauren Macy, Nasdira Romero Saravia, Carolyn Fisher","abstract":"Immigrants are now more than one-fifth of the poor in the U.S. Yet, despite some valuable literature, immigrant poverty remains arguably understudied.

There is considerable heterogeneity over time. After declining for several decades, immigrant poverty increased substantially in recent years. Immigrant poverty also varies enormously across states. States’ immigrant poverty rates are moderately negatively correlated with states’ immigrant share of the population and strongly positively correlated with states’ non-immigrant poverty. There are large heterogeneities by nation of origin as well. While immigrants from India have among the lowest poverty of any group in the U.S., Honduran immigrant poverty is 6-7 times higher. While especially being a non-citizen immigrant increases poverty, heterogeneities in immigrant poverty are driven more by the major risks of poverty than the immigrant characteristics of being a citizen, years of residence, or mixed status households. That said, heterogeneities by nation of origin are explained by varying mixes of risks, immigrant characteristics and educational selectivity. Ultimately, we demonstrate immigrant poverty is not one coherent phenomenon.

Research strategy could benefit from a more granular and detailed understanding of the different contributions that research and development can make to the address of societal problems; of when each type of contribution is needed; and of how to identify research projects with the potential to achieve each contribution. I outline three different scientific activities—problem description and attribution, option assessment and evaluation, and option identification and development—and the different contributions they can make to societal problems exhibiting value consensus and value dissensus. I also provide two “catechisms” intended to help identify when each contribution is needed and what kinds of research are most likely to achieve each. I deploy this framework to the problem of “scientific choice,” to which it is intended to contribute, and suggest fruitful lines of research on societal allocation of scientific and innovative effort.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/35mec_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/35mec_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3464,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Conservation abandonment is a policy blind spot","authors":"Thomas Pienkowski, Matt Clark, Michael B.

To date, this coordinated international effort has been inadequate to halt global biodiversity loss. A major but unaccounted-for cause of the shortfall between policy ambitions and real-world outcomes is the abandonment of conservation initiatives, including both informal abdication of resource management responsibilities and formal reversal of governing rules and boundaries (Fig. 1). The US$200 billion annually committed to conservation is spent on a wide diversity of conservation measures, increasingly beyond traditional national parks and other protected areas (PAs), including community-based conservation, eco-certification, and payments for ecosystem services (2). The scant monitoring of conservation abandonment, derived almost entirely from PAs, demonstrates widespread informal abandonment of management responsibilities (i.e., “paper parks” (e.g., 3, 4)) and formal abandonment through protected area downgrading, downsizing, and degazettement (PADDD) (e.g., 5, 6).","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/49kbx_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/49kbx_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3294,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Examining the Push and Pull Dynamics in Human Trafficking: Insights from Nigeria","authors":"Olatokunbo Yakeen","abstract":"This paper explores the push and pull forces contributing to the context of human trafficking in Nigeria.

Key areas influencing the phenomenon of human trafficking are socioeconomic, political, and cultural factors that drive individuals into trafficking situations. The push factors include marginalised groups, poverty, lack of education, and political instability, which often encompasses corruption. In contrast, the variables of the pull factors promise a better life in economic opportunities and better living conditions. The Push and Pull, migration, and feminist theories were adopted for this study, which provided a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between the concepts of push and pull.

Marriage is still perceived as normative in Germany and enshrined in institutions, yet marriage rates have been declining in the last decades. I investigate whether attitudes towards gender roles held jointly by couples and their change might explain this discrepancy. I examine a sample of 1297 German couples followed yearly from the beginning of their partnership onwards from 2008 to 2019, with information on both partners, selected from a representative probability sample. I use a series of Competing Risk survival models, comparing couples from West Germany with couples from East Germany. Sharing attitudes towards gender roles at the beginning of the relationship is positively related to marriage likelihoods in the West but not in the East. Convergence to a shared attitude for couples who start with diverging attitudes is also correlated with higher marriage risks, with differences between West German and East German couples. Correlation between attitudinal convergence and marriage probabilities highlights the need for couple-focused research when investigating partnership patterns. Differences in the correlations between West- and East German couples indicate possible effects of the predominant idea of marriage on the relationship between couple’s gender attitudes and their relationship outcomes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8kd53_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/8kd53_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5363,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"From disparate lists to population estimates: A multiple systems estimation workflow for mortality analysis in conflict settings","authors":"Maria Gargiulo","abstract":"Quantifying mortality in conflict settings is a challenging but necessary task for health and humanitarian response, historical memory, and accountability. In conflict settings, traditional demographic data sources, like vital statistics, may not be available or of suitable quality for mortality estimation. However, alternative sources documenting the deceased may exist, such as digital trace data, news reports, or data collected by civil society organizations. These sources are not without their own biases. Rather than being statistically representative samples or complete counts, they are convenience samples: they represent the fraction of violence that was documented. However, when multiple sources are taken together, multiple systems estimation (capture-recapture) can be used for mortality estimation. This article describes a workflow for mortality estimation using disparate and statistically biased data sources, motivated by three missing data challenges commonly encountered in conflict settings: missing identifiers to link victims across sources, missing covariates in records of documented victims, and records of victims that are entirely undocumented. The workflow is demonstrated using data about conflict-related homicides during the armed conflict in Colombia from 1985–2018. Beyond its applications to conflict mortality estimation, this workflow can be applied to examine mortality due to other causes or other events of demographic interest.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avc97_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/avc97_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4309,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Study of the Role of Higher Education Institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa (HEIAs): Challenges and Opportunities","authors":"Stephen Silliman, Julius Ssentongo, Ticora V Jones, Brent Wells","abstract":"Surveys and interviews in Sub-Saharan Africa studied the roles of Higher Education Institutions in Africa (HEIAs) as leaders in development-focused research and translation initiatives.

Research remains inconclusive whether the weight changes are intentional or if they reflect more unintentional mechanisms. We first examine fluctuations in both objective (BMI) and subjective weight (self-rated weight and weight satisfaction) before, during, and after marital separation. In the year of separation, women’s BMI decreases by an average of 1 unit (equivalent to 6.3 pounds for a 5’5” woman), compared to a 0.3 unit decline for men (approximately 2 pounds for a 5’10” man). These patterns align with shifts in subjective weight: around the year of separation, men and women report greater weight satisfaction and women are less likely to perceive themselves as overweight. We then explore potential explanatory mechanisms to elucidate intentionality. Results indicate no substantial changes in dieting and exercise for women or men during marital dissolution but concurrent increases in psychological distress that are more substantial for men, highlighting that weight changes might be linked to unintentional stress-related mechanisms rather than intentional weight-loss behaviors.

This repressive stance is largely anticipated, given the widely acknowledged patriarchal nature of the Chinese state and the prominent role of nationalism in its ideology, wherein feminism and nationalism are often perceived as antithetical. However, the emergence of pink feminism (fenhong nvquan) in China since 2020 has challenged this rigid opposition by embracing feminism and nationalism simultaneously. To understand this alternative relationship between feminism and nationalism in China, this study employs online ethnography to explore how pink feminism reconciles the seemingly contradictory nature of feminism and nationalism. Through thematic analysis, four themes explaining the reconciliation emerge: 1) Pink Feminism as Marxist/socialist feminism; 2) conditional nationalism; 3) Pink Feminism as post-colonial feminism; 4) “China” as a multi-faceted notion and constructive patriotism.  By examining pink feminism, this study contributes to a more heterogeneous understanding of contemporary Chinese feminism, challenges oversimplified interpretations of Chinese feminism and nationalism, and sheds light on the CCP’s resilience in navigating the rise of grassroots feminist movements.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ms2wu_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ms2wu_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4849,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Loose Derivation Chains and Scientific Stagnation in Criminology: Evidence from Self-Control Research","authors":"Jonathan R.

Paul Meehl’s concept of “logical derivation chains” provides a diagnostic framework for understanding this persistent problem, yet it remains largely absent from criminological practice. Using Gottfredson and Hirschi’s self-control theory as a detailed case study, including empirical analysis illustrating potential measurement incoherence, I argue that loose derivation chains are structural features of social scientific inquiry rather than correctable methodological problems. Through systematic analysis of sampling, measurement, and analytical choices, I reveal how auxiliary assumptions accumulate throughout the research process, creating compound derivation chain failures. The analysis identifies a “correlation paradox” where a correlation of r = -.31 (p &lt; 2e-16), typically celebrated as impressive empirical support, corresponds to theoretical failure for 39% of individual cases. Contemporary statistical methods systematically privilege aggregate patterns over individual variation, rendering theoretically crucial anomalies invisible and creating research programs that appear progressive despite exhibiting degenerating characteristics. The analysis concludes with strategies for constraint-aware research, including individual-level prediction assessment and item-specific analysis that reveal theoretically important anomalies hidden by aggregate correlations, alongside institutional reforms that encourage genuine theoretical advancement over mere accumulation of supportive correlations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/n4xuf_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/n4xuf_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4598,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Adult Care, Work and Well-being in Europe: Ad hoc module for submission to ESS call for rotating modules","authors":"Alzbeta Bartova, Wim Van Lancker, Holly Shorey","abstract":"In this deliverable, we propose a Rotating Module to be included in the European Social Survey (ESS).

Longitudinal evidence from the UK and France","authors":"Daniel Nettle, Coralie Chevallier, Kate Pickett, Matthew T.

Evidence to date has examined fluctuations from year to year or from day to day, whereas a more relevant timescale might be month to month. Here, we use data from the Changing Cost of Living Study, a longitudinal panel from the UK and France with monthly data (n = 484). We examine the association between month-to-month income volatility and two outcomes, self-rated general health and anxiety-depression (a composite measure derived from GAD-7 and PHQ-8 scores). Higher volatility was associated with worse health on both measures, with volatility accounting for similar amounts of variation as the level of income. Some association between income volatility and health is to be expected as a consequence of the concavity of the income-health relationship: because of concavity, a downward fluctuation damages health more than the equivalent upward fluctuation improves it. We show that the observed associations are 3 and 4 times too strong to be explained by this mechanism alone. We suggest that volatility, because it introduces uncertainty and stress, has substantial direct health effects. This claim is important for public policy: it means that policies and institutions that smooth people’s income streams can have beneficial health effects even if they don’t raise anyone’s income.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rwf79_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/rwf79_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4513,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Beyond ‘Equality’: Work and Family Ideals in Contemporary U.S.","authors":"Inés Martínez Echagüe, Joanna Pepin","abstract":"This article provides critical new insight into the discrepancy between the seemingly widespread desire for egalitarian arrangements alongside the reality of persistent unequal work-family arrangements. We argue that haziness in the meaning of what constitutes an egalitarian work-family arrangement results in an overestimation of the desire for evenly sharing paid and unpaid labor. Using original survey data nationally representative of adults in the United States (N = 998), findings show an unspecified sharing arrangement was chosen as ideal by about 50 percent of respondents. Yet, when given precise definitions of what constitutes equal sharing, only 25 percent of respondents considered an even-sharing arrangement their ideal, whereas the majority opted for uneven or non-symmetrical methods of sharing. Rejecting gender essentialism, the belief that men and women are inherently different, was associated with an increased likelihood in reporting an even-sharing ideal, among both men and women. Being a sole provider was less idolized when gender essentialist beliefs were low, especially among men. We conclude that overlooking the variety of work-family arrangements that typical Americans consider to be egalitarian erroneously disregards gender beliefs as a primary barrier to equal partnerships.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tp95v_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/tp95v_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5002,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Sound Bias: the surprising impact of Spotify’s royalty payment threshold on mid-tier artists","authors":"Gordon Dimitrieff","abstract":"In April 2024, Spotify eliminated royalties for tracks with fewer than 1,000 annual streams, justifying the move as a deterrent to streaming fraud, a way to clean up “noise” content and a fix for “trapped” micropayments. Spotify asserted that these changes would benefit “emerging and professional artists” and claimed the policy would not affect music discovery or promotion. This study rigorously tests those claims using a 21-month, 42,000-observation dataset normalized for Spotify’s user growth. By applying difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity and event study designs across artist tiers and career stages, the analysis isolates the policy’s true effects. Contrary to its stated intent, the policy produced a paradoxical outcome: mid-tier artists (10,000–100,000 listeners) experienced a 20% drop in market share growth, while artists already on an upward trajectory captured nearly all the gains. These effects emerged gradually, reflecting algorithmic recalibration rather than immediate changes in listener behaviour, and remained robust across multiple sensitivity checks. Notably, the anticipated substitution effect, where attention would shift to adjacent tiers, did not materialize. These findings reveal that even policies framed as technical or anti-fraud measures can act as powerful infrastructural interventions, quietly amplifying existing inequalities. Rather than democratizing the platform, Spotify’s threshold deepened market concentration and favoured those already poised to benefit. These results highlight the need for rigorous, forward-looking assessment of policy interventions to fully understand their systemic impacts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xkh24_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/xkh24_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4387,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Yrittäjäisien perhevapaat Suomessa","authors":"INVEST Flagship, Sanni Kotimäki, Simon Chapman, Satu Helske, Milla Salin","abstract":"Yrittäjät ovat isien perhevapaita käsittelevässä tutkimuskirjallisuudessa merkittävän aliedustettu väestöryhmä, vaikka yrittäjien työn erilainen luonne palkansaajiin nähden oletettavasti heijastuu yrittäjäisien perhevapaisiin.

Yet, little is known about how rural host communities respond to environmental migrants. This study investigates attitudes towards internally displaced environmental migrants in northern Bangladesh, focusing on three key mechanisms: perceived deservingness, empathy through geographic and experiential proximity, and personal contact. We draw on a pre-registered, face-to-face survey with 265 rural respondents. At the core of our survey is a forced-choice conjoint experimental design (N=936) to causally assess how different migrant characteristics -- including reason for migration, occupation, religion, and distance from origin -- influence host preferences. Findings show that migrants displaced by riverbank erosion are significantly more likely to be accepted than economic migrants, reflecting a strong role for deservingness in shaping attitudes. Environmental displacement also attenuates discrimination based on other migrant attributes, such as religion, occupation, and distance of migrant origin. Respondents who experienced similar environmental hardships, such as erosion-induced house loss, expressed the strongest preferences for environmentally displaced migrants, supporting the empathy mechanism. In contrast, simple exposure to in-migrants in the village had no measurable effect on attitudes, challenging assumptions about the universal benefits of intergroup contact. Our study extends the migration attitudes literature by focusing on internal, rural-to-rural displacement in a climate-vulnerable context. These findings highlight how moral judgments and experiential proximity can foster inclusive attitudes even in resource-constrained settings, with important implications for societal resilience under climate change.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2e3du_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/2e3du_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.6375,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"A changing ethnic landscape?

Moreover, Turkish immigrants showed a tendency to feel more German and felt closer to Turkey at the same time. Poles also felt more German but not closer to Poland.

Our research concentrated on three specific areas: 1) archaeological survey between the Bat towers and surrounding the proposed visitor’s center site; 2) excavations of Umm an-Nar period houses at the Settlement Slope and at Rakhat al-Madrh .Bat South); and 3) artifact and landscape analyses / رخة المدره( The area surveyed specifically to alert the MHC of any cultural resources within a proposed location for the Visitors Center yielded few results, as an active farm and wellhead were situated within the proposed footprint. The MHC immediately took these findings under advisement and their plans have proceeded. Intensive archaeological survey was conducted on the Settlement Slope, around the Bronze Age tower “al-Qa’a” and at Rakhat al-Madrh before beginning excavations. Together, the survey resulted in the documentation of almost 200 previously unrecorded sites. Excavations at the Settlement Slope uncovered an Umm an-Nar period house rich in ceramic artifacts that date the structure’s occupation to the ca. 2200 BCE. Several samples of carbon were collected and will be tested to date the house. Another structure was excavated at Rakhat al-Madrh, located approximately 8 km southeast of Bat. There are at least four houses all placed around an ancient water catchment area. One structure at the site was excavated, revealing an Umm an-Nar period house built with mudbrick walls atop a stone foundation. Ceramics and shell beads were found within the house which is comprised of long, narrow rooms and a central courtyard. The house excavations at both the Settlement Slope and Rakhat al-Madrh are helping us understand the diversity of places and ecologies in which people lived in Bronze Age Oman. Several artifact and landscape analyses were also conducted at Bat this year. We are developing a new ceramic chronology for the Umm an-Nar period. A study of the lithics excavated and collected at Bat since 2007 was also conducted by Dr. Petranka Nedelcheva, a stone tool specialist, to better understand the development of lithic technology in northern Oman. This winter’s rains also allowed for a survey of plants growing around Bat’s archaeology to help us better envision what the site might have looked like 5,000 years ago. Finally, a survey of the status of many of the northern towers was conducted.

Nugent, Eli N. Dollarhide, Jennifer Swerida, Asma Bint Rashid Al Jassisi, Reilly S. Jensen","abstract":"The Bat Archaeological Project (BAP) conducted its 2022 season of excavations and surveys from 26 December 2021 – 24 February 2022. Our research concentrated on five key areas: 1) archaeological excavation at the southeastern end of the Settlement Slope in Umm an-Nar mortuary and domestic contexts; 2) excavation of Umm an-Nar period houses at Rakhat al-Madrh; 3) systematic survey to better understand temporal relationships and artifact density between Bat’s different areas; 4) geomorphological analyses at Rakhat al-Madrh; and 5) an expanded arts outreach and experimental archaeology program to further engage the local community. At the Settlement Slope, mortuary excavations revealed a small but deep Umm an-Nar tomb, unusually located on a hillside with a commanding view of Bat’s ancient landscape. A shallow, rectangular platform built into the hillside was discovered adjacent to the tomb and was covered in small bone fragments. The structure may have served as a body processing area utilized before interment. The continued excavations of Structure SS12 on the Settlement Slope revealed the area’s Umm an-Nar Middle II and Late Umm an-Nar period occupation and behaviors. Domestic excavations continued at Rakhat al Madrh, where two Umm an-Nar period houses were excavated and a geomorphological study of the area was conducted. The house excavations revealed ovens, hearths, and botanically-rich contexts within typical Middle Umm an-Nar domestic spaces. Geomorphological and hydrological investigations suggest the area’s environmental conditions are unlike any other region occupied in Umm an-Nar Bat. Greater water access from flooding events and the recharge of the basin’s water table could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided abundant vegetation for animal pasturing. A multi-year survey project to better understand the areas between Bat’s monuments was completed this winter and resulted in the discovery of a likely Iron Age fortress at Khutm, lithic scatters surrounding Rakhat al Madrh, and a dense area of Umm an Nar artifacts north and east of Operation A. An environmental resilience study continued BAP’s investigations of the intersection of the site's ancient and modern landscapes. The analysis of artifacts and samples collected from excavations and survey operations are ongoing. The project also launched an expanded outreach program, implementing arts engagement strategies to connect with local residents. The program culminated in the creation of an original comic book and experimental pottery production project that was disseminated to the community via Bat’s schools after the conclusion of field season. We deeply appreciate the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism’s ongoing collaboration and support of this research.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a9jht_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/a9jht_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.267,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Earnings Effects of Direct Worker Voice in Production","authors":"Dylan Nelson, Nathan Wilmers","abstract":"When employers use input from workers, who benefits? Direct worker voice in production could boost productivity and strengthen the bargaining position of production workers. Or it could be a way that employers appropriate workers' knowledge and expertise, thereby weakening workers' position. Using a survey of 30,000 US manufacturing establishments matched to administrative records of worker earnings and business performance, we find that employers using worker voice pay workers more and have higher productivity. Even conditional on workers' human capital and establishment characteristics, workplaces using worker voice pay a small earnings premium. One third of this premium is due to increased productivity; the remaining two thirds of the premium reflects greater worker bargaining power. This analysis provides evidence that worker voice in production supports increased earnings for production workers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aex94_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/aex94_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4018,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"From ‘breathing spaces’ to arnasguneak: the development of the concept in the Basque context","authors":"Maddi Dorronsoro Olamusu","abstract":"This article examines the development of the concept of arnasgune in the Basque context. While initially referring to demographically concentrated areas where a minority language thrives, as a translation of Fishman’s ‘breathing spaces’, arnasgune has undergone significant conceptual expansion. The term has gained traction in academic research, language policy, and media discourse, sparking debate over its precise definition. Through a qualitative analysis of academic literature, policy documents and newspaper articles, this study traces the evolution of arnasgune and its varied uses. This paper identifies two key perspectives: a dominant group advocating for a strict socio-territorial interpretation, and a more flexible understanding of the term. Additionally, this study highlights how the growing prominence of arnasgune has drawn social and policy attention to previously overlooked sociolinguistic contexts crucial to the future of the Basque language. It argues that the contested nature of the term arnasgune enriches local discussions on language revitalisation, also illustrating how conceptual shifts reflect deeper sociolinguistic and cultural transformations in the Basque context. Ultimately, by analysing the evolution and use of the term arnasgune, the article contributes to ongoing discussions surrounding minority language maintenance, language policy and minority language media.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/akr4q_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/akr4q_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4035,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Equalizing Education, Equalizing Opportunity? How Education Shapes the Origin-Destination Link","authors":"Fabian Kratz, Markus Klein","abstract":"This study investigates the impact of various educational equalization strategies on labor market disparities by social origin in Great Britain. Specifically, we examine three hypothetical interventions: 1) equalizing higher education rates across social origin groups, 2) equalizing the labor market returns to higher education across social origin groups, and 3) randomly assigning higher education within each social origin group. We hypothesize that equalizing access to higher education would reduce labor market disparities, while the random assignment of high-er education within origin groups would increase them. Reframing conflicting arguments in an ongoing debate, we propose competing hypotheses on whether equalizing returns to higher education increases or decreases labor market disparities. To test these hypotheses, we use a novel non-parametric decomposition method and longitudinal data from the 1970 British Cohort Study. For both sexes, our findings show that equalizing higher education attainment rates would reduce labor market disparities, whereas randomly assigning higher education within origin groups would have no significant impact. The effect of equalizing the benefits of higher education varies by sex and differs depending on whether wages or occupational out-comes are considered.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avzqd_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/avzqd_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5644,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Bat Archaeological Project Preliminary Report of the 2023-24 Season","authors":"Jennifer Swerida, Selin E.

At Rakhat al-Madrh, excavations explored the Umm an-Nar period structures along the edge of the site’s central depression. Building on the results of BAP’s previous two years of work at the site, this season focused on the especially large RaM 3 building. This structure was found to have multiple phases of activity and unusual features that suggest a social function that differs from other excavated buildings at the site—possibly as a public building. Excavations at RaM continued to discover botanically-rich contexts. A third season of geomorphological and hydrological investigations continued to support the interpretation that Rakhat al-Madrh’s environmental and archaeological conditions are unlike the rest of Bat and unique for Bronze Age Southeastern Arabia. Possible human manipulation of flooding events in the basin could have enabled the cultivation of flood crops and provided abundant vegetation for animal pasturing. Botanical analysis suggests wheat, barley, goat grass, cyperaceae, and palm were all grown at the site in the third millennium BC. Test excavations at al-Khutm Settlement continued to clarify the architectural and occupational history of the site. While limited in finds, an Umm an-Nar complex of house, platform monument, and tomb at the eastern end of the Khutm hillside provide new insights into both ritual and domestic behaviors in the third millennium BCE. At the Husn al-Wardi, we began extensively documenting the mudbrick architecture of the Husn al Wardi through photography and 3D photogrammetry, as part of an annual, longitudinal study to identify structural integrity risks and recommend actions for conservation. The project also expanded its community engagement and outreach program by beginning a longitudinal study with Bat residents using structured interviews to document perceptions and expectations of ongoing archaeological research and redesign research and outreach practices to integrate community voices in the years ahead. We also continued our partnership with the Bat office of the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism as well as local partners in the BAP School Day Event.

Traditional survey-based research on antisemitism and anti-Israel sentiment is often limited by response biases and social desirability bias. This study introduces a novel field-experimental approach to measuring anti-Israel sentiment in a real-world university setting. Using event history analysis, it examines the removal probability of stickers of the Israeli flag compared to German, US, Palestinian, and rainbow flags at a German university. Over a 24-week period, 600 stickers were placed on 50 public notice boards and were monitored for 14-day cycles. The results provide strong evidence of anti-Israel sentiment. The Israeli flag had the highest removal rate, with only 47.5% of the flags remaining at the end of the observation period—significantly lower than the survival rates of the other flags (which range from 68% to 80%). Cox regression analysis confirms that Israeli flags faced the highest removal hazard, being 3.3 to 3.7-times more likely to be removed than the rainbow flag and nearly twice as likely as the German flag. Politically motivated removals, though less frequent, disproportionately targeted Israeli flags as well. Removal rates were highest in hallways of the humanities, shared humanities/social sciences as well as in central facilities hallways. Hallways in the natural sciences, the human- and social sciences and economics had lower removal rates. Areas with higher student traffic exhibited fewer removals. Overall, the findings indicate a pronounced anti-Israel bias on campus, distinct from attitudes toward other nationalities or symbols.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcr4y_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/hcr4y_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5676,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Immigration Attitudes and the Puzzle of Latinos’ Swing Toward the GOP","authors":"Daniel Hopkins, William Marble","abstract":"In the wake of the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections, scholars, politicians, and commentators alike frequently characterized Latino voters as unlikely to support anti-immigration candidates, especially when immigration is salient.

How did Trump increase Latino support despite the mismatch between his opposition to unauthorized immigration and Latinos' historically pro-immigration views? We investigate this question primarily using multiple high-quality, population-based panels of Latinos interviewed in English or Spanish (2016-2024). We document a restrictionist turn in Latinos' attitudes, alongside perceptions that both parties slightly moderated. Immigration attitudes were consistently integrated with vote choice to roughly the same degree in 2016, 2020, and 2024 for both Latino and white voters, and do not prove especially predictive for Latinos.

We use mixed effects models with heterogenous variance components, and latent group mixed effects models. Our findings align with our central argument that the degree of similarity in trajectories within social classes differs across classes. Social class is linked to typical earnings trajectories, with a pronounced division between the salariat and other classes. However, the degree of trajectory similarity varies across classes. Salaried workers show the least tightly clustered trajectories. Fluctuation in earnings is most pronounced for lower-grade and routine workers.

The study adopted a descriptive research design and a quantitative research approach. The target population was 548 staff working in finance, investment, risk, actuarial and operations departments in the six insurance firms listed in Nairobi Securities Exchange. The sample size was determined using Yamane's Formula and stratified random sampling was used in the selection of the sample size. The study made use of both primary and secondary data. The study used a data extraction tool to collect secondary data from the annual reports and financial statements of the insurance companies. The study made use of structured questionnaires to collect primary data. The questionnaires generated quantitative data. Descriptive and inferential statistics was used in analyzing quantitative data with the help of the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 24) statistical software. Descriptive statistics included frequency distribution, percentages, mean, and standard deviation. Inferential data analysis was done using Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis. The study found that price volatility mitigation has a positive and significant effect on securities market financial performance of listed insurance firms in Kenya. The study recommends that insurance firms should focus on implementing strategies to effectively manage supply and demand dynamics within the securities market.

The study area consisted of a 0.23 km2 space between the five main towers of Bat: Al-Rojoom, 1156, Al-Khafaji, Al-Ahliya, and Matariya. Thirty-nine transects were walked at 5 m intervals. All diagnostic finds were mapped and collected and a count of non-diagnostic finds kept for each transect. A total of 218 (180 previously undocumented) features were documented within the thirty-nine transects. The majority of identifiable feature types were walls, and the majority of artifacts represented belonged to the Bronze Age. There is a clear variation in the distributions of ceramics across the site. Many of the transects indicate extensive use during the Umm an-Nar period. However, the transects around Matariya indicate use primarily during the early Umm an-Nar period and earlier; transects between Rojoom and Khafaji indicate use during the Iron Age and later; and transects between al-Ahliya and the Settlement Slope suggest use in the Pre-Modern period. Petrographic analysis of ceramics from the Bat to ‘Amlah areas show distinct changes both in time and in space. The ceramics from Bat South are the same as those from Bat, suggesting that the people lived and/or worked closely together. The survey identified three areas for targeted excavation. These trenches focused on: (1) Hafit period mudbrick architecture east of Matariya tower; (2) intact Umm an-Nar deposits across from the Settlement Slope; and (3) varying ancient topography in the center of the site. Future fieldwork will focus on understanding the relationship between settlement, subsistence, and sociopolitical organization in prehistoric Bat and its environs.

Challenging hydraulic-state orthodoxy, I argue that domestication emerged not through discrete human control but via phase transitions within fire-maintained ecotones operating on 3-7 year cycles. Through archaeobotanical and genomic evidence, I demonstrate that upland swidden systems created recursive attractors - ecological and cognitive feedback loops in which rice and humans co-adapted through repeated burning (t), systematic return (t+1), and selective harvesting (t+2). Fire functioned simultaneously as ecological reset mechanism and prosthetic memory system, compressing successional cycles while entraining selection pressures across multiple plant generations. These early disturbance regimes structured not only rice biology but the cognitive infrastructure enabling subsequent agricultural intensification. I propose that domestication represents a distributed phase shift in socio-ecological networks - a recursive enclosure operating at the ashline where repetitive human-fire interactions established the conditions for coevolutionary change without requiring conscious breeding programs.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jy4h_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/3jy4h_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3764,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Caste, Migration, and Intragroup Polarisation: Psychosocial Dynamics within the South Asian Diaspora in the UK","authors":"Saira Mirza","abstract":"This chapter examines the intersecting psychosocial phenomena that shape the lives of South Asians in the UK within their complex bioecological systems, informed by their distinct social, cultural, historical, and political contexts. Under the lenses of intersectional feminism and post-colonial theory, the chapter explores the interplay between caste, migration and group dynamics, revealing caste as not only a social structure but also a deeply internalised belief system that influences individual behaviour, identity, and well-being. Advantaged and disadvantaged castes internalise superiority or inferiority respectively, through experiences of shame and intergenerational trauma, creating a sense of ‘otherness’ that polarises the group. This internalisation exacerbates socioeconomic divisions and mental health challenges, further entrenching disparities and creating an intragroup polarisation. The complexities of acculturation in post-colonial Britain further complicate caste dynamics as individuals navigate between traditional identities and the pressures of integration into a multicultural society.

A central goal in this regard is to calibrate trust, i.e., to align people’s trust with the “actual trustworthiness” of AI systems. The present article argues that we should refrain from using the concept of actual trustworthiness. Leveraging philosophical pragmatism and phenomenological thought, it shows why the ideas of actual trustworthiness and calibrated trust are not only epistemologically but also ethically problematic. “Actual trustworthiness” recasts the question of whether an agent deserves trust – which has a normative dimension – into a question of factual correctness. It also draws humans in the same behavioural framework as machines, treating the relation between AI trustworthiness and human trust as something that is calculable – rather than subject to deliberation. Beyond leading us astray in our language use, this can serve to reduce the space for human autonomy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/74z2x_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/74z2x_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3466,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Welsh accents and social identity: A study on perceptions of new and traditional speakers","authors":"Robert Mayr, Jonathan Morris, Ianto Gruffydd","abstract":"This paper presents the results of an accent rating study of Welsh in which 59 raters were asked to listen to speech samples of three speaker groups (Welsh home language speakers, immersion education learners, and adult learners). The study aimed to ascertain (a) whether these groups are identifiable based on their accents, (b) how raters evaluate the three speaker groups socially, and (c) what phonetic features they associate with them. The results revealed that all groups could be identified well above chance and received positive evaluations in terms of status and solidarity-based traits. However, traditional speakers were correctly identified significantly more often and were perceived more favourably in the social evaluations. In the feature analysis, new speakers’ accents were largely described as deviant from traditional speakers’ although some distinctive patterns were also identified. These findings have important implications for discussions surrounding accent bias and the emergence of new speaker varieties.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9r2gj_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9r2gj_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4512,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Low-Code Strategy with Machine Learning for the Healthcare Area: Assessing the Correlation of Occupational Activity with the Incidence of Cancer in Brazil","authors":"Rafael L. Queiroz, Joberto S. B. Martins","abstract":"Artificial intelligence and machine learning are widely utilized and offer significant benefits in various fields of knowledge, including healthcare. However, there is an important barrier to disseminating machine learning among healthcare professionals, which primarily stems from their unfamiliarity with programming and computing concepts. The development strategy known as 'low-code,' when applied to software development, encompasses frameworks and tools that, in short, make application development more accessible to professional communities. The low-code strategy simplifies the software development process. This strategy is particularly relevant for smart cities that seek to develop approaches that enhance the efficiency, humanity, and sustainability of cities, thereby contributing to the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This article positions the low-code strategy, implemented through the PyCaret framework, as a key element of innovation and contribution to the development of health systems utilizing machine learning in smart cities. The paper presents the low-code strategy through a case study that evaluates the incidence and correlation of occupational activities with the occurrence of cancer in Brazil using an anomaly detection algorithm. The article's contributions include positioning the low-code strategy as an element of innovation in smart cities and presenting a case study that serves as a reference for developing applications with machine learning in the healthcare sector. The case study presented, in turn, presents a differentiated approach to detecting cancer using an anomaly detection algorithm and reiterates correlations between types of cancer and occupational activities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9wsqn_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9wsqn_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3344,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Evaluation of Generated Responses by ChatGPT to Complex Linguistics Related Questions","authors":"Hadis Habibi","abstract":"As a generative AI chatbot which is based on large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT (4.o) offers numerous advantages and promising applications in applied linguistics (Alaqlobi et. al., 2024). However, there are still some uncertainties and concerns regarding its accuracy of responses to some complex questions related to linguistics (Qamar et al., 2024; Nuland, 2024; Dale, 2021). To address this gap, 5 participants as mediators from 5 countries in 3 continents were engaged in this study. Their responsibility was to initially copy a set of predefined questions (syntax, n=1 &amp; semantics, n=1) from the email sent to them and then input them into ChatGPT. The accuracy of responses was measured and checked through the assistance of two senior lecturers in Linguistics at a private college in Athens, Greece. In addition to the evaluation of the questions and responses, the two experts labeled the responses based on three criteria: accurate, partially accurate and inaccurate. The categorized responses were eventually analyzed by a software program. The findings indicated that ChatGPT demonstrated stronger performance in syntax-related questions compared to semantic-related questions. More specifically, its overall performance in responding to more analytical and subject specific questions such as those related to semantics was less than mediocre. This study adds to the persistent debate on the role of AI in linguistics and offers insights into the reliability and accuracy of responses by ChatGPT to complex questions.

Housing policy makers often see 'pathways' as how households move between different tenancies and tenures, including social housing and emergency housing. However, it is useful to think of pathways as the different experiences households have with their housing and their housing aspirations. This helps us think about how housing assistance can support housing pathways and how the social housing system can better support households. Why this research is important: a better system for socially supported housing pathways could focus on supporting each person and household's needs and goals, rather than being constricted by access to a small number of social housing homes. With social housing getting much-needed extra funding, it is important to also improve how the system works with households that need help.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d4asg_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/d4asg_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3547,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"“I appreciate birding more”: Exploring and reframing experiences of disabled birders using a strengths-based approach","authors":"Freya McGregor, Ashley A. Dayer, Emily N. Sinkular","abstract":"While being disabled is often considered a deficit that creates only problems, in reality every human has interests, values, skills, knowledge and external supports that can act as strengths when participating in recreation. Indeed, many disabled birders anecdotally report experiencing positives of birding with a disability, and the inherent modifiability of birding may allow disabled birders to experience different ways of engaging with this activity. We conducted a survey of disabled birders (n=147), then used inductive coding to analyze the responses to an open-ended question (n=106) about the positives of birding they experience. These responses included themes of slowing down, identifying more birds, noticing more details of birds, and feeling a sense of belonging in nature. This reconsidering of disability using a strengths-based approach creates opportunities for disabled birders and bird-related programming to focus on aspects of birding that may be more in line with disabled birders’ interests, experiences and strengths. It also creates a new avenue for nature organizations to engage with up to a quarter of the population who may feel excluded due to disability. This study contributes to the literature by exploring a rarely studied topic of disabled birders’ experiences using a strengths-based approach to studying disability in outdoor recreation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/evc4m_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/evc4m_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3781,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"What if we implemented a congestion charging scheme in Los Angeles? An epidemiological assessment and predicted impacts","authors":"Mayank Kejriwal","abstract":"This study investigates the potential health impacts of implementing a hypothetical Congestion Charging Scheme (CCS) in Los Angeles (LA), a city facing significant traffic-related air pollution. Traffic emissions are a major source of pollutants like particulate matter (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which have been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Utilizing intervention-based epidemiological study designs, the research estimates the effects of a proposed 25% traffic reduction in downtown LA. Simulated results indicate a substantial decrease in NO2 and PM10 levels, with predicted increases of 1,263.58 years of life gained (YLG) in the greater LA area over a decade. The discussion highlights the potential of CCS to not only reduce pollution but also address socio-economic disparities in health outcomes. This model could serve as a blueprint for other urban areas considering similar policy interventions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fk9wm_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/fk9wm_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.379,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"National Birth Outcomes and Care Utilization for Infants of Emergency Medicaid Eligible Parents","authors":"Xeuchao Qian, Lilla Orr, Duncan Lawrence, Fernando S.

Cognitive dissonance occurs when people face situations that do not confirm their expectations. Past WT participants have protested that involuntary, inescapable, and harsh conditions harmed them through PTSD and subsequent dissociation. This argumentative study compares dissonance and dissociation using a critical realist and argumentative research process using publicly available information. Using the confronting coercive WT model to illuminate concerns clearly, we argue that dissociation is a response recorded in the design of these WT practices and participant statements and is often mistaken for dissonance. Deliberate use of forced cognitive dissonance during involuntary treatments aligns with the conditions that may cause dissociation. Therefore, planning to enforce cognitive dissonance during WT is likely to be harmful and, given this potential, may be regarded as malpractice","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qta5p_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/qta5p_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3544,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Recent changes to public land budgets and staffing are changing the way avid outdoor recreationists plan their activities.","authors":"Elizabeth Himschoot, Brendan Derrick Taff","abstract":"Recent changes to the federal workforce and agency budgets, including those working in public lands, have garnered international attention.

These events have been widely interpreted through the lens of manipulation, deviance, and disruption; all closely linked to the spread of false information, automated amplification, and foreign interference in digital communication environments. More recently, advances in Artificial Intelligence have added to anxieties about the growing sophistication and scale of disinformation campaigns. Collectively, these concerns are often framed under the concept of digital disinformation and viewed as posing existential threats to democratic systems. This entry provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the disinformation debate. It traces the definitional and conceptual challenges inherent in the term “disinformation,” highlights how digital infrastructures shape both the problem and its perceived urgency, and synthesizes empirical evidence on the actual reach, distribution, and impact of political disinformation. The article distinguishes between individual, collective, and discursive harms, while cautioning against inflated threat narratives that outpace empirical findings. Importantly, the entry addresses the risks of regulatory overreach and centralized control. Efforts to counter disinformation may themselves undermine democratic openness, suppress dissent, and weaken societies’ capacity for collective information processing. In response, the article outlines a research agenda that prioritizes conceptual clarity, empirical rigor, and systemic analysis over alarmism. It advocates for a shift away from overstreching framings of disinformation toward more precise and differentiated understandings of digital political communication and its challenges.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xtfq2_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/xtfq2_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4146,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Using artificial intelligence to detect predatory journals: all that glitters is not gold","authors":"Lukáš Plch, Vojtěch Pilař","abstract":"The abuse of the open access model by publishers of predatory journals has caused serious disruption to scientific publishing. Recognizing a legitimate scientific journal from a predatory one is becoming increasingly difficult, and the scientific community is coming up with many ways to detect them. One of the new methods is the involvement of artificial intelligence. This short communication summarizes the limits of using artificial intelligence in detecting predatory journals and divides them into three categories – the limits associated with the creation of untrustworthy and legitimate journals, the heterogeneity of definitions and characteristics of predatory journals, and the grey area of scientific publishing. The very cases where artificial intelligence has failed to perform well on this issue speak to the need to add an expert perspective to quantitative machine evaluation of predatory journals and to focus primarily on the data on which artificial intelligence models operate and train.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfbms_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/yfbms_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.2928,"specialized":false,"preprint":true}]
