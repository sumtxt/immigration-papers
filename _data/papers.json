[{"title": "Defiant pride: Origins and consequences of ethnic voting", "authors": "Mashail Malik", "abstract": "Why do voters often remain loyal to ethnic parties despite receiving little in terms of material welfare? I develop a theory focused on the role of dignity concerns in explaining within‐group variation in ethnic party loyalty. Group members who face discrimination from state agencies dominated by outgroups respond with defiant pride, which manifests as ethnicity becoming a larger part of the self‐concept. This heightened ethnic identification creates a demand for recognition through descriptive representation. Consequently, high‐identifying group members—often from lower social classes—are more forgiving of malfeasance by ethnic parties and more likely to trade off material for symbolic goods. I provide experimental, descriptive, and qualitative evidence for this argument from Karachi, Pakistan—a megacity ruled for three decades by a poorly governing ethnic party. This article pushes the literature on ethnic voting beyond dominant instrumental approaches and underscores the necessity of systematically unpacking heterogeneity within ethnic groups.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70015", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70015", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.5455130526609742}, {"title": "Race, Democracy, and Public Support for War", "authors": "MICHAEL TOMZ, JESSICA L.

Polarization can clarify political positions and thereby simplify the formation of opinions, increase the stakes of elections, and offer more options to citizens. To estimate the impact of polarization from a causal perspective, we exploit variation within individuals over time using individual-level data from the Swiss Household Panel spanning from 1999 – 2023, amounting to 178,251 observations from 28,187 persons. Ideological polarization at the individual level is measured by a process of increasing extremity of the self-position on the left-right scale. In addition, we test how polarization of cohabiting household members has spillover effects on political engagement and trust. For political engagement, we adopt a comprehensive approach, focusing on interest in politics, participation in popular votes, party identification, and frequency of political discussions as dependent variables. Political trust is measured as confidence in the federal council. To analyze the data, we primarily use fixed effects models, complemented by a pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, and cross-lagged models to address reverse causality. Results show that ideological polarization does promote engagement but has a weak negative impact on political trust. This effect remains significant when controlling for affective polarization. Additionally, there is an overall increase in political engagement and a decrease in political trust if partners living in the same household become more extreme in their ideological preferences.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676525100248", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676525100248", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010712703650986533}, {"title": "Coalition government formation and policy payoffs", "authors": "David M.

This allows us to investigate how structural political socialisation and indoctrination in more or less democratic regimes affect the democratic values of migrants and to what extent possible differences in values diminish when migrants from non-democratic countries settle in democratic countries. The analyses show that all three – non-migrants, migrants from more democratic countries, and migrants from less democratic countries – have high levels of liberal democratic values. At this elevated level, we additionally observe that longer periods of socialisation in less democratic countries of origin reduce, and longer periods in more democratic countries of destination increase, migrants’ support for liberal democratic values.

To answer this question, we leverage the fact that the timing of major Hindu festivals in India is exogenously determined by the lunar calendar and that when a major Hindu festival happens to fall on a Friday—the principal day Muslims attend mosque—the likelihood of a Hindu-Muslim riot increases significantly. Using this instrument, we find that the well-documented serial correlation in Hindu-Muslim riots disappears entirely (T = 1950–2006).

Ultimately, the chances of migration-driven coercion to be successful should increase when target countries are both domestically unstable and suffer from environmental shocks. This claim is tested using quantitative data on the outcomes of coercive engineered migrations since the 1950s, which I combine with information on environmental extremes, as measured by the number of environmental disasters. Controlling for several other influences that may affect the outcome and employing sample-selection estimators that account for the non-random assignment of coercive engineered migration, the results support the argument as I show that the likelihood of successful migration-related coercion increases when domestically unstable target countries also face environmental disasters.

We engage a survey experiment to extend the ‘relational theory of terror perception’ to one’s attachment to the nation. We test how national attachment, an ostensibly positive disposition and distinct from patriotism and nationalism, shapes how racially motivated violence is perceived. We find that those with a stronger attachment to the nation are less concerned by hypothetical incidents of white supremacist violence than those with a weaker attachment to the nation. These biases that minimize concern for white supremacist violence are held across the political spectrum and are not simply a function of race, party affiliation, or political ideology. In fact, national attachment is a stronger predictor of attitudes toward white supremacy than respondent race; we find no support for our hypothesis that white respondents would be less concerned by violence committed by white perpetrators.

Examining perceptions of neighborhood safety, wealth, and disorder reveals a clear bias in GenAI toward national averages over local perspectives.

Muttram", "abstract": "In recent years, prominent Republican elites have instituted statewide migrant transportation programs in which asylum-seeking migrants are “bused” to liberal cities across the country. These programs are often justified by invoking NIMBYism (not-in-my-backyard), suggesting that when people must consider the effects of immigration policy in terms of their community, their attitudes toward immigrants will vary. Despite this, extant scholarship has yet to document the extent to which American immigration preferences vary by spatial scale and gives no expectation about how important any variation is relative to other determinants of immigration attitudes. Findings from a conjoint experiment reveal that Americans, on average, oppose immigrants proposed to move into their neighborhoods, but spatial scale does not alter considerations at the national, state, or city level. The relative importance of this NIMBY effect, however, is modest compared to a host of other individual-level characteristics of an immigrant. Moreover, despite elite claims of “liberal hypocrisy” in immigration, we find no evidence that the NIMBY effect varies by partisanship. Both Democrats and Republicans exhibit modest preferences against immigrants expected to move to their neighborhoods.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096525101467", "doi": "10.1017/s1049096525101467", "journal_full": "PS: Political Science & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9970886005642818}, {"title": "What is to be done about The Autocratic Academy?", "authors": "Michael W.

Over 20 million noncitizens pay taxes, own businesses and homes, send their children to schools, and make countless economic, social, and cultural contributions every day. Yet they cannot vote to select politicians who make policy that affects their daily lives. Today, noncitizens currently vote legally in local elections in 22 cities and towns in Maryland, Vermont, California, and Washington, DC. These practices have their roots in another little-known fact: noncitizens voted in 40 states at some point in time from the Founding until 1926. Noncitizens voted not only in local elections but also in state and federal elections, and they could hold office such as alderman. “Alien suffrage” was seen as a means to facilitate immigrant incorporation and citizenship, which it did in practice. This article examines the politics and practices of immigrant voting in the US, chronicling the rise and fall—and reemergence—of immigrant voting rights. It explores arguments for and against noncitizen voting, reviews evidence about its impact on policy and American political development, and considers its implications for immigration policy and democratic practice. Debate about immigrant voting rights can be viewed as a microcosm of broader debate about immigration, citizenship, and democracy reflected in scholarship and political conflict embroiling the nation, which holds valuable lessons for scholars and policy makers today. I argue, in a country where “no taxation without representation” was a rallying cry for revolution, such a proposition might not be so outlandish upon further scrutiny.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096525101492", "doi": "10.1017/s1049096525101492", "journal_full": "PS: Political Science & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9561981350840106}, {"title": "The Advantages of taking the Long View: American Political Development and Higher Education", "authors": "Julie L.

Within the region, Chile used to stand alone as the poster child of economic growth and political stability from 1990 to 2010. However, a stark contrast is perceived since around 2014, as Chile has also been trapped in a decade of slow economic growth, marking a shift in its economic trend. This paper examines this Chilean slowdown from an empirical perspective and determines how much can be attributed to internal and external causes. Using the Synthetic Control Method (SCM), our empirical analysis suggests that at least two-thirds of Chile’s recent slowdown can be attributed to internal causes (i.e., policy regime change) and only one-third to external ones. Our results are consistent with the literature, confirming that external volatility can explain only a small fraction of poor economic performance, suggesting that internal factors are the primary source.

Examining how WeChat users communicate sensitive issues, knowing that every word and image they share can be tracked, analyzed, and acted upon, we, bringing the work of James Scott in dialogue with Chinese internet studies, demonstrate how online contention is openly articulated, but simultaneously obfuscated and disguised. We focus on the sticky super app WeChat, being the central node of the Chinese internet, deeply integrated into everyday life. We argue that, especially in China and other authoritarian contexts, it is vital to situate, study, and analyze online contention within the flows of everyday communication. Confronted by ubiquitous surveillance and censorship, Chinese citizens constantly and consciously calibrate the way they voice or do not voice opinions on sensitive societal issues. By weaving sensitive messages through mundane exchanges on social media, they can hide in plain sight.

We demonstrate this approach by analyzing Mexico’s PROGRESA anti-poverty program. The analysis reveals that while the program prioritized certain subgroups — such as indigenous households — the fact that those groups benefited more implies that the program did not actually assign them a higher welfare weight.

Through in-depth interviews with male returnees in Tamil Nadu, the paper explores how migrants in highly precarious situations mediate modes of irregularity, examining the vulnerabilities they face as well as the strategies they use to manage the migration system. In adopting a migrant-centered perspective, this article sees migrants as co-constructors of (ir)regularity rather than as victims of the migration industry. We develop the emic category of “ khalluli ” to problematize the assumed link between the structural aspects of the migration system and the agency of migrants in dealing with its injustices. Rather than seeing engagement in “khalluli” or irregular labor as a coping strategy, we show that it is a collective sensibility that is woven into the social practices of migrant men.

It is estimated that out of around 281 million international migrants, 12.2% (34.3 million) are aged 65 or older. Looking at cases from Japan and Malaysia, this report discusses the experiences and challenges of older or “aging” Filipino migrant workers, many of whom happen to be among the most vulnerable.

This formalization is perceived as a mutually beneficial win-win arrangement: host countries secure labor, source countries establish a reliable system of remittances that contribute to development, and migrants are positioned as individuals attaining access to secure and better employment. Labor contractors have been made important in this context, as they play a role in forming linkages, managing a steady supply of workers, managing bureaucratic procedures, training workers, and becoming a buffer between labor and capital. While the dominant debate has been on blaming the labor contractors for the exploitation of migrant workers and creating precarious forms of work, this paper uses racialization theory to locate their role against the backdrop of enforcing return, fragmented labor management, upward capital concentration, and downward labor outsourcing. Using the case of Thai migrant workers who work seasonally in the berry farms of Sweden, it highlights a fundamental contradiction in the current regime of transient servitude: migrant worker is desired, yet the individuals embodying it are not. In so doing, an array of contractual and extra-contractual mechanisms is employed, which reinforces deeply racialized ideologies, stereotypes, and institutions. The use of labor contractors is one such mechanism. Utilizing racialization theory, the thesis identifies enforced return of migrants and the pursuit of an ideal worker as crucial components in the formalization of transnational circular migration. Deportation, rather than being an ultimate objective of enforcing return, serves to deepen the inherent vulnerability experienced by workers who grapple with the understanding that their deportability is an intrinsic aspect of their existence. This reinforcement further amplifies deeply entrenched racialized forms of insecurity, where laborers form a permanent labor force of the temporarily employed. To ensure that migrant workers are at the forefront of recruitment for specific types of low-paying and precarious work, employers strategically employ racialized narratives, portraying them as invaluable assets by emphasizing their perceived strong “work ethic” and reliability. This depiction elevates them to the status of “good workers,” surpassing the local labor alternative.

We examine White Democrats’ racial attitudes further using four framing experiments that we embed in a nationally representative survey. The experiments demonstrate that younger generations of Democrats are often, but not always, the group most supportive of progressive racial rhetoric when compared to older Democrats, Republicans in their generation, and older Republicans. Older Democrats often mirror the attitudes of their younger counterpart. Thus, we find that racial attitudes are shaped not just by generation but also by partisan cues. Last, when it comes to reparations, young Democrats are merely less hostile to the policy than other groups in our sample but do not endorse reparations. Overall, our findings thus suggest that while younger generations of Democrats are sometimes more progressive in their racial attitudes than other groups, their racial attitudes are somewhat inconsistent.

Khandani entrepreneurs rapidly accumulate start-up capital by leveraging their reputational credibility and transnational embeddedness, securing preferential access to large-scale financing through Rotating Credit Associations (kameti). By contrast, non-Khandani entrepreneurs face delayed entry, relying on modest loans from kin and co-ethnic migrants, with limited capacity to scale. The study highlights how lineage-based prestige intersects with broader kinship networks (Biraderi), producing differentiated trajectories of immigrant entrepreneurship.

We tackle this question by examining the role that categories and figures of migration—such as the “genuine” and “bogus” asylum seeker, the refugee, and the economic migrant—play in European border policy and how they are changing in the present conjuncture. We argue that a redefinition is taking place of who counts as a “good” and “bad” migrant, which responds to the changing political economy of contemporary European capitalism and is reflected in the growing prominence of the dichotomy of “legal” and “illegal” migration. This, we argue, reconfigures the existing categories of economic migrant and asylum seeker and speaks to the emergence of new forms of racialized disposability at Europe’s borders.

The mechanism analysis suggests that migrating to cities at a younger age promotes higher income, better social integration, and enhanced cognitive awareness of urban education. Moreover, a heterogeneity analysis reveals that the positive effects of early city migration on children migrating with their parents are more pronounced among second‐born children, younger children, and migrants with lower education. Further analysis demonstrates the significant impact of early migration to cities in shaping gender disparities, particularly by increasing the likelihood of sons migrating with their parents.

Our findings demonstrate how participants recalibrated their strategies in international political tensions and economic recessions at the macro level, with alterations in mobility infrastructure at the meso level.

A gravity model with Poisson pseudo‐maximum likelihood estimation is employed to assess the impact of cities' industrial structure—measured by industrial structure rationalisation, inter‐sectoral upgrading, and intra‐sectoral manufacturing upgrading—on intercity migration. The econometric results indicate that higher levels of industrial structure rationalisation and nonagricultural industrial development are associated with greater in‐migration and lower out‐migration. A higher capital‐intensive manufacturing concentration tends to reduce population inflows, whereas cities with a higher concentration of technology‐intensive manufacturing attract more migrants.

Descriptive statistics show that endogamous immigrants are most likely to be living near their parents, followed by exogamous immigrants, and then endogamous and exogamous Swedes. However, discrete choice models of residential mobility behaviors , which account for the spatial distribution of housing, reveal that all groups are more likely to locate nearer to parents, with only modest differences between them. Across model specifications, the effect of distance to parents for immigrants in exogamous unions is slightly, but consistently, weaker than for their partners or counterparts in other kinds of unions.

In this paper, we investigate systematically the relationship between polygyny and men’s marriage prospects.

Second, through analysis of 84.1 million census records from 30 countries across Africa, Asia, and Oceania between 1969 and 2016, we show that the subnational association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men is negative or null, rather than positive, for almost all countries in the sample. Third, through analysis of the full-count 1880 US federal census, we show that the average prevalence of unmarried men is lower, not higher, across counties of the West with Mormon polygyny, compared to other counties of the West, and to counties of the Midwest and the Northeast; it is higher only compared to counties of the South.

We show that high-income countries face higher air pollution–attributable mortality owing to population aging, in contrast to the established exposure inequality pattern. While affluent populations within most countries also face higher mortality burdens, in several low-income countries, this pattern is reversed due to elevated exposures among impoverished rural populations. South Asia and Africa exhibit the highest levels of vulnerability to coincident mortality and poverty, where populations living in periurban transition zones bear disproportionate dual burdens.

Extreme weather events such as droughts decrease agricultural yield and harvested areas, impact the domestic trade of agricultural products and, in turn, food manufacturing. We investigate this relationship at the state level by estimating the food manufacturing production function in a two-stage instrumental variable estimation process. We first assess how drought affects trade in animals and fish, cereal grains, and all other crop products. Next, we estimate a nested production function for processed food. Our findings indicate that the impact of a drought is far from being confined to the area where it happens. At the national level, we find that a 1% increase in drought in the states producing agricultural commodities reduces their exports to other states by 0.5% to 0.7% which, in turn, reduces food manufacturing production by an average of 0.04%. The capacity to shift the origin of import flows, adjust their volume, and substitute agricultural inputs supports the resilience of the food manufacturing sector. We further estimate the 48 × 48 pairwise dependence across states and by commodity group. While cereal grain production is more spatially concentrated than other crops, the agrifood supply chain can enhance its resilience by sourcing from geographically diverse counties within key supplier states and improving multistate coordination.

This paper uses the introduction of a crop pest to sub-Saharan Africa to estimate the effect of a negative agricultural productivity shock on deforestation. Using primary household data, we first find that farmers who were exposed to higher levels of fall armyworm saw substantial decreases in yield and food security. Using estimates of fall armyworm suitability in conjunction with machine-learning models of maize yields and deforestation, we find that the introduction of the fall armyworm induced a doubling of the deforestation rate in Zambia in the 3 y following the outbreak. This increase was driven both by increased agricultural land expansion and increased charcoal production as a coping strategy. These responses vary substantially over space. More remote areas experienced 23% lower FAW-induced deforestation compared with the sample average, suggesting that farmers with access to maize and charcoal markets may have increased deforestation as a response. Wealthier areas were also less likely to deforest in response to FAW pressure. In sum, our results suggest that negative agricultural productivity shocks may lead to a negative climate feedback, with farmers engaging in emissions-increasing strategies in response.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2427156122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2427156122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01726338392241855}, {"title": "Association of affirmative action with health and education outcomes and services in India", "authors": "Priyanka Pandey, K G Sahadevan, Paul David Hastings", "abstract": "Structural and social inequalities are determinants of poor human development outcomes in low- and middle-income countries.

Exposure was 60 village clusters with, and nonexposure was 60 village clusters without, local leadership reserved for scheduled caste (SC) in 2021 local elections. Primary outcomes were infant mortality rate (IMR) and student test scores. Secondary outcomes were prenatal visits, mother tetanus vaccinations, prenatal supplement, infant vaccination, and teacher engagement in schools. Groups did not differ on socioeconomic, geographic, and service delivery indicators in 2020 (baseline). In 2023, 2.5 y after elections, exposure village clusters had lower IMR (0.46 IRR; [0.30 to 0.69]; P &lt; 0.001), and exposure village clusters had significantly higher odds of two prenatal visits, two tetanus vaccinations, and prenatal supplement received by the second trimester. Exposure was not associated with maternal care in the first trimester or infant vaccination. Exposure was not associated with test scores, but teacher engagement was lower in exposure village clusters. Exposure group leaders reported higher discrimination than nonexposure group, and in follow-up interviews, they described more difficulty in working with teachers. Affirmative action in local governments in India predicted greater infant survival and improved prenatal health services, indicating benefits of addressing structural inequities.

Their reanalysis, while differently specified, reinforces our central finding: adolescents with Jewish upbringing demonstrate higher rates of college completion and selective institution attendance. We defend our use of a multidimensional SES index—including income, education, and occupational prestige—grounded in stratification research, and we consider the theoretical and empirical utility of their proposed alternatives. Yet their replication overlooks the qualitative evidence central to our argument: the role of self-concept congruence, or the alignment between one’s identity and educational trajectory. Among girls with at least one Jewish parent, we find that attending a selective college is not simply an instrumental goal but part of who they envision themselves becoming. This congruence is shaped by a habitus rooted not only in social class but also in Jewish upbringing. In contrast, similarly positioned non-Jewish peers do not express the same identity-education alignment. We also respond to their concern that our work risks essentialism or reflects “culture of poverty” arguments. Our study explicitly avoids attributing educational outcomes to ascribed group identity. Instead, we identify clear, transferable mechanisms, including habitus and self-concept congruence, through which religious subcultures influence educational trajectories. These mechanisms are socially transmitted, shaped by family culture and broader structural contexts, and portable across groups and settings.

I examine this phenomenon through the evolution of civil wars in Colombia in the mid-twentieth century, a period initially marked by a Liberal–Conservative conflict that developed into a civil war between the state and communist guerrillas. Drawing on archival records, oral histories of civilians and combatants, and newspapers, I demonstrate that when one party invents an “imagined third”—an actor, external to the original conflict dyad, who lacks any connection to an actual military or political threat—to blame for the violence in civil war, a self-fulfilling logic turns the imagined third into a tangible enemy of the nation, thereby creating a new fault line. In Colombia, politicians’ baseless accusations and preemptive actions against Communists activated three mechanisms of fault line formation—enemy legitimation, boundary demarcation, and identity shift—that materialized the very revolutionary threats they claimed to prevent.

Analyzing over 220,000 digitized divorce decrees from China’s patrilineal family system, this study reveals a paradox: despite mothers serving as primary caregivers, fathers more frequently obtain custody. Two institutional pillars of patrilineage explain this outcome. First, paternal grandparents commonly assume childcare responsibilities as fathers’ proxies, reducing mothers’ custody prospects.

Immigrant coworkers, assimilation, and employee turnover", "authors": "Edvard Nergård Larsen, Aleksander Å Madsen, Are Skeie Hermansen", "abstract": "How does the presence of immigrant coworkers shape the likelihood that minority employees stay or leave their jobs? This study uses linked employer–employee administrative data covering the entire Norwegian labor market to investigate how workplace immigrant concentration influences turnover among immigrants and their native-born children. Building on theories of organizational demography, we ask whether working alongside a higher share of immigrant-background coworkers fosters employee retention—consistent with mechanisms of social contact and homophily—or instead prompts workplace exit, as suggested by group threat and competition theories. Our findings reveal that greater representation of immigrant-background coworkers significantly reduces turnover among immigrants, especially when contact occurs within same-skill occupations. The exposure effects reducing the likelihood of workplace exit are also stronger when immigrant-background employees share the same national origin with their minority coworkers and when minorities are better represented among top earners in the organization. For children of immigrants, the effects of coworker composition are weaker, consistent with theories of assimilation and the weakening of ethnic boundaries across generations. Taken together, these results support social contact theories, which claim that a more inclusive work environment and coworker support in more ethnically diverse workplace contexts foster organizational attachment and reduce turnover among immigrant-background minority employees. However, minority employees’ increased retention in organizations with higher immigrant concentration may also reinforce patterns of ethnic workplace segregation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf161", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf161", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9918722426785467}, {"title": "Beyond the Diagonal Reference Model: Critiques and New Directions in the Analysis of Mobility Effects", "authors": "Ethan Fosse, Fabian T.

We make four main contributions to this rapidly expanding literature. First, we show that under plausible values of mobility effects, the DRM will, in many cases, implicitly force the underlying mobility linear effect toward zero. In addition, we show both mathematically and through simulations that the mobility effects estimated by the DRM are sensitive to the size and sign of the origin and destination linear effects, often in ways that are unlikely to be intuitive to applied researchers. This finding clarifies why, contrary to expectations, applied researchers have generally found mixed evidence of mobility effects. Second, we generalize the identification problem of conventional mobility effect models by showing that the DRM and related methods can be viewed as special cases of a bounding analysis, where identification is achieved by invoking extremely strong assumptions. Finally, and importantly, we present a new framework for the analysis of mobility tables based on the identification and estimation of joint parameter sets, introducing what we call the structural and dynamic inequality model. We show that this model is fully identified, relies on much weaker assumptions than conventional models of mobility effects, and can be treated both as a descriptive model and, if additional assumptions are invoked, as a causal model.

It aims to validate whether AI-enhanced open-source intelligence (OSINT) evidence governance can reconstruct auditable evidence chains and quantify narrative discrepancies in education-related public incidents, while extrapolating governance performance to multidimensional national security risks. Methodologically, we collected university announcements, mainstream media reports, platform-accessible pages, and judicial leads within a unified time window to construct a “source-time-version” evidence graph. We introduced multilingual NLI and sentence vectors to measure narrative consistency, combined with JSD to monitor monitoring scope drift. We employed temporal propagation networks and DTW to measure the temporal misalignment between “post deletion/restriction” and public opinion peaks. Further, we mapped “evidence governance/information control opacity” to four normalized risk dimensions—academic integrity, rule of law and institutional trust, ideological security, and social stability—using structural causal models, providing 95% confidence intervals. Results indicate: The foundational evidence chain can be robustly reconstructed, yet significant narrative gaps exist regarding “whether ‘7 categories, 40 items’ of fraud occurred” and “whether platform actions were implemented/compliant.” Communication peaks typically precede search peaks by approximately one cycle (moderate DTW misalignment), with public nodes consistently holding the highest intermediary scores. Among the four risk dimensions, “academic integrity” and “ideological security” exhibit relatively higher levels. Conclusions indicate that earlier, auditable evidence disclosure (versioned notifications, third-party verification, platform log retention) simultaneously reduces all four risk dimensions and shortens the public opinion chain, whereas declarative statements alone fail to resolve disputes.

Purpose: This study probes how the confluence of sovereign debt strain, entitlement promises, and derivatives exposure can destabilize the dollar’s reserve-currency privilege and maps reforms capable of forestalling a debt-driven systemic rupture. Methods: An integrative review of Congressional Budget Office forecasts, BIS derivatives statistics, and peer-reviewed network-risk models is synthesized through a tri-theoretical lens that combines Modern Monetary Theory, Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis, and network-based systemic-risk science. Results: Vector-error-correction analysis reveals that a one-point rise in the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio lifts global derivatives gross-market value by 0.7 percent within two quarters, indicating tight macro-financial coupling. Stress scenarios show that breaching a 120 percent debt-to-GDP threshold alongside derivatives GMV above 10 percent of GDP elevates one-notch downgrade odds to 50 percent within two years.

However, domestic capabilities and strategies mediated EU resourcing, brokering, facilitation, and protection, the main functions of the DNS.

This study examines participation in, and returns to, non-formal job-related training among vocationally and generally educated workers. Non-formal training, such as structured courses or seminars, allows employees to update and consolidate skills throughout their careers. We hypothesize that general graduates benefit more in early careers, while vocational graduates gain later as training helps counteract skill obsolescence. Drawing on longitudinal data from the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we find that secondary-level vocational graduates participate less in training than university graduates, whereas tertiary-level vocational graduates train at similar rates. Training promotes employment stability, particularly in later careers, but effects are relatively uniform across educational groups. These results indicate that while training strengthens career resilience, it does not eliminate disparities between vocational and general graduates.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/763bm_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/763bm_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011184211358878926}, {"title": "Care in crisis: Picturing care work and climate change in the Philippines", "authors": "Samantha Julia Legaspi Eala, Rebecca Patrick, Theo Prudencio Juhani Capeding, Cathy Vaughan", "abstract": "As climate change exacerbates socioeconomic vulnerabilities, women, often carers, emerge as \"invisible safety nets\" sustaining family and community resilience.

Latin American countries may be addressing region-specific health concerns or environmental challenges different from the European countries. A bibliographic universal classification of SDGs may overlook such crucial issues and nuances vital to the development of these countries. This study emphasises the differing priorities between Latin America and certain countries in the Global North regarding the health and well-being of all individuals. It focuses on improving reproductive, maternal, and child health, ending epidemics of major contagious diseases, reducing non-communicable diseases, promoting mental health and well-being, and addressing behavioral and environmental health risk factors. While Latin American countries often focus on topics like infections or mental health, the Global North tends to priorities Covid 19 and cancer. These differences reflect distinct economic, social, and political contexts, with us Global North sometimes overlooking the foundational needs of Global South countries. The research employs a sample from the Open Alex database, focusing on the ten most productive countries in Latin America and the ten most productive countries in Europe in SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being in the period of 2023-2024. The study, which falls under the framework of SDG 3 publications and employs data analytics techniques, identifies priority topics for Latin America and Europe, as well as common interests across both regions. Utilising predictive models based on machine learning, the study forecasts the topics that these countries are likely to prioritize in the near future with an accuracy of 60%. This level of accuracy may be influenced by the sample size used; therefore, future analyses will incorporate additional data, such as examining abstracts to determine whether European countries continue to diverge in their focus or if they find common ground on certain topics.

In this paper, we propose a set of criteria to define ENC and track its emergence in the archaeological record. These criteria highlight the importance of persistent, publicly accessible, and evolutionarily incremental modifications that sustained behavioural coordination among individuals in space and time. We apply this framework to three major domains of material culture: the structuring of space for collective action, the culturalization of the human body, and the emergence of exosomatic artefacts to store coded information.

This paper introduces a Political Stress Index (Ψ) designed as a retrospective and prospective tool. This index aim to identify periods during which structural stress accumulates and aligns across three dimensions: elite overproduction and factionalism, fiscal fragility of the state, and the potential of the population to mobilize. When these variables rise together, the likelihood of significant institutional change increases. Applying this framework to post-war France, we argue that recent political unrest should be interpreted not as a series of isolated disruptions, but as the cumulative effect of deep structural transformations.

These typologies are linked to composite measures of marginalisation and integration, constructed from group-level socioeconomic indicators at settlement and five years later. Results reveal that the association between neighbourhood role and integration outcomes is neighbourhood-dependent rather than uniform. The same neighbourhood may function as a site of long-term residence for some immigrant groups, while being highly transient for others. We find no overall association between internal migration patterns and socioeconomic integration outcomes at the neighbourhood-level. Neighbourhoods near city centres and on the periphery often display dual functions, indicating transitional dynamics within the urban system. Over time, sinks tend to become more strongly associated with marginalisation, while the role of sluices remains variable. The findings support a pluralistic understanding of neighbourhoods as dynamic contexts shaped by migration flows, rather than as fixed determinants of outcomes, as integration and spatial mobility are linked for some immigrant groups but not others.

Typically seen as a technical endeavour, M&amp;E is frequently presumed to yield impartial, objective assessments of societal advancement. This paper contests that assumption by proposing a philosophical redefinition of M&amp;E as performative ritualism, a fusion of Judith Butler’s theory of performativity and Victor Turner’s anthropology of ritual. The analysis employs a critical conceptual methodology and normative critique. Butler's explanation of performativity shows how indicators and reports work not just as reflections but also as performative utterances that have an \"impact\" through their repeated use in rituals. Turner's ritual theory shows that evaluation cycles baseline, midline, and endline act as rites of passage, turning ambiguity into symbolic closure for funders and policymakers. Post-humanist insights further expand these frameworks, illustrating how dashboards, algorithms, and artificial intelligence tools now operate alongside human evaluators, reinforcing evaluative categories through automated repetition. The findings indicate the cultural and ethical conflict of these activities within African cultures. Western evaluation rituals focus on linearity, abstraction, and bureaucratic closure. In contrast, African communitarian ethics focus on relational accountability, oral testimony, and cyclical processes of responsibility. The difference shows how theatrical imported evaluative systems are; it also shows how to recreate ethics by thinking of evaluation as participatory storytelling and communal debate instead of a bureaucratic audit. The article finds that monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) is not a neutral tool but a symbolic system that enacts legitimacy and authority.

Experimental pressing of its branches produced a golden-tawny juice, accompanied by the crackling sound noted in Vedic hymns. Experiential trials confirmed psychoactive and healing effects resembling those praised in the hymns, such as relaxation, enhanced concentration, relief from pain, and states of calm joy.

It contends that these systems are not impartial technology of efficiency but modern manifestations of colonial control mechanisms. The paper, based on Quijano's idea of the \"coloniality of power,\" says that digital program management is a form of epistemic violence since it turns communities into databases and puts donor supervision ahead of relational accountability. Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) functions, integrated into these systems, exacerbate the issue by legitimising surveillance and data extraction as the prevailing framework of responsibility. Based on decolonial theory, the analysis compares the technocratic positivism that underlies today's management methods with epistemologies based on Indigenous African Knowledge Systems (IKS), especially Ubuntu relationality. Biometric systems erase relational identity by favouring individualised markers over community recognition. Dashboards impose a managerial \"view from nowhere,\" turning complexity into metrics. Mobile survey tools silence oral testimony by putting stories into pre-coded categories. These behaviours show how digital program administration weakens local ways of knowing and gives more authority to outside funders and technocrats. In response, the article proposes a normative framework of Relational Accountability. It asks for a change from data extraction to ethical witnessing, participatory discussion in community assemblies (baraza), data sovereignty as cultural sovereignty, and the speculative design of Ubuntu-centric technology, all based on IKS principles.

Grit, defined as the trait of working diligently for long-term goals, is important for life satisfaction. This study examines the relationship between grit and life satisfaction for second-year high school students in South Korea and the mediating effects of crucial relationships formed by adolescents, such as teacher-student relationships, parent-child relationships, and friendships. The data was collected through the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS), and there were 2,252 second-year high school students who participated in this study. By completing regression analyses on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, grit and the mediating variables, and the effect of grit and the mediating variables on life satisfaction, as demonstrated by the Baron and Kenny process (Baron and Kenny, 1986), it was found that these variables were all correlated with each other. On the third step of the regression analysis, where the mediators were controlled for, it was found that the mediators had a significant effect on the relationship between grit and life satisfaction, and a partial mediation took place. Out of the mediators, teacher-student relationships had the biggest explanatory impact with an R-squared value of 0.177.

This article posits that AGI signifies an epistemological rupture in the extensive continuum of scientific rationality, wherein explanation, the quest for causal and conceptual comprehension, transitions to simulation, a mode of cognition propelled by predictive patterning rather than interpretative profundity. The paper engages figures from the philosophy of science and philosophical hermeneutics, including Popper, Kuhn, Hempel, and Lakatos, in conversation with Gadamer, Ricoeur, and Heidegger, to investigate how AGI redefines the concept of “knowledge.” Through a hermeneutic analysis of AGI manifestos, research papers, and policy documents, the study interprets these scientific texts as manifestations of a novel epistemic attitude, one that prioritises performance over comprehension and reduces explanation to algorithmic efficiency.

It can make convincing audio-visual content that looks just like real media. Although much of the current research has looked at deepfakes from legal, technological, or ethical points of view, this article uses a psychological point of view to explain their particular potency. The main point is that deepfakes don't work mostly as rational lies; instead, they work as cognitive exploits, types of \"perceptual malware\" that attack the way people trust each other. The article illustrates how deepfakes exploit entrenched biases, such as the truth bias, familiarity effects, and the fluency of perceptual processing, by referencing cognitive psychology and neuroscience. In doing so, they avoid higher-order logical inspection and use autonomic processes of recognition and belief construction. The paper also puts deepfakes in the context of other research on false information and how memories can change, suggesting that fake media can create false memories or strengthen existing biases through repeated exposure. Deepfakes undermine epistemic trust by eroding the dependability of visual and aural evidence, which have historically been regarded as the \"gold standard\" of credibility, in contrast to conventional kinds of propaganda. This situation not only puts democratic discourse and trust in the media at risk, but it also poses a serious psychological challenge: fighting deepfakes requires using cognitive and perceptual mechanisms that are mostly outside of conscious control. This article provides an interdisciplinary framework for comprehending deepfakes as psychological weapons by integrating insights from cognitive science, information warfare studies, and emerging media research.

This study investigates how entrepreneurs in Lagos and Nairobi mobilize informality to build resilience and navigate institutional voids. Drawing on qualitative interviews and thematic analysis, the findings show that resilience is not an episodic response to shocks but a structural entrepreneurial capacity embedded in everyday practices. Startups in Lagos adopt survival-driven strategies that rely on grassroots bricolage and selective compliance, while those in Nairobi pursue more collaborative approaches that leverage donor partnerships and community-based legitimacy. Informality emerges not as a deficit but as a productive resource that enables adaptation, innovation, and hybrid legitimacy across both contexts. Theoretically, the study contributes to institutional theory by reframing voids as enduring and generative rather than transitional. It extends entrepreneurship research by conceptualizing resilience as an ingrained capacity rather than a reactive response, and it advances the study of informality by demonstrating its role as a strategic resource.

Although traditional literature regards Power BI mainly as a visualisation or decision-support instrument, this study employs a critical conceptual and metascientific perspective to analyse how the platform pre-defines legitimate evidence, influences organisational reasoning, and reallocates interpretive labour within knowledge-driven organisations. The analysis puts up three connected arguments. To begin with, Power BI acts like a cognitive prosthesis by automating basic operations like trend identification, forecasting, and comparison measurements. This frees managers from low-level duties while also making them dependent on its dashboards and algorithmic logic. Second, it works as a micro-technology of cognitive capitalism by capturing, directing, and turning management attention into a resource of economic and organisational value. Third, the platform incorporates epistemic authority into its visualisations and metrics, gently regulating the generation of organisational knowledge and influencing the ethical and political aspects of managerial decision-making. By integrating perspectives from cognitive science, critical theory, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and political economy, the article illustrates that the automation of cognition is inherently biased, resulting in epistemic constriction, ethical challenges, and technocratic validation masquerading as “data-driven” objectivity. The research enhances metascientific discourse by elucidating the infrastructure of knowledge production within organisations and advocating for reflexive literacy in the utilisation of data analytics platforms.

This effect offsets inflationary pressures from tariffs and supply shocks. Calibrated on U.S. macroeconomic data, the model reveals that loosening monetary policy stimulates housing-related expenditure while dampening CPI inflation. Our transmission mechanism challenges classical views and offers insights for policymakers navigating today’s volatile economic environment.

Instead of viewing persons as the most vulnerable component in technical systems, social engineering should be recognised as a means of revealing the cultivation, maintenance, and exploitation of moral and intellectual inclinations within digital contexts. Current ethical frameworks predominantly exhibit deontological and utilitarian influences, prioritising adherence to regulations or the optimisation of favourable results. Although these frameworks possess practical applicability, they inadequately represent the moral agency of individuals faced with deception. This essay constructs a conceptual analysis that reinterprets social engineering within the context of Digital Virtue Ethics. Utilising Aristotle's notion of phronesis and MacIntyre's interpretation of practices, the argument underscores that effective resistance to manipulation relies more on the cultivation of qualities such as wisdom, temperance, courage, and justice than on strict compliance with laws. Insights from virtue epistemology, especially in the writings of Zagzebski and Sosa, enhance this study by highlighting epistemic vigilance through attentiveness, humility, and conscientiousness. The amalgamation of these traditions facilitates the emergence of Digital Phronesis: a distinctive form of practical wisdom tailored to the inherent unpredictability and persuasive dynamics of online existence. The important point is that technical precautions and compliance procedures are necessary, but they are not enough on their own. They need a philosophical framework that sees people as moral actors who can develop strong inclinations.

At the semantic level, it is concluded that the structure introduced by en describes a dynamic, durative, atelic event that entails agentivity. This way, this article intends to contribute to our understanding of a construction that is unique among Romance languages.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/63r7u_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/63r7u_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.052956515990722486}, {"title": "Smallholders’ perspectives on restoring farmlands in western India", "authors": "Abha Joglekar, Morena Mills, Arundhati Jagadish", "abstract": "Agroforestry adoption by smallholders globally has been limited despite long-term encouragement from national policies. In India, a dedicated agroforestry policy, combined with its potential to contribute to forest restoration goals, has led to a renewed emphasis on promoting the adoption of agroforestry practices among smallholders. However, the views of smallholders residing near forest fringes, who are often approached for adopting agroforestry as part of restoration plans, have not been extensively documented. Using surveys and interviews, we investigate the motivations for engagement and non-engagement in agroforestry for forest restoration among smallholder farmers in Chhota Udepur district, Gujarat. Our logistic regression model indicates that the results of agroforestry from fellow farmers and knowledge about government programs have a strong positive association with agroforestry engagement. In contrast, water availability and trust in government are negatively associated with engagement. Our interviews substantiate these associations and provide additional information about perceived risks. Specifically, water shortages and labour scarcity are significant barriers to smallholders considering the adoption of agroforestry. In all sampled villages, smallholders have emphasised a need for reliable markets for selling agroforestry produce. The mobilisation of sales through existing farmer producer organisations in the region presents an opportunity to increase agroforestry uptake among farmers. Additionally, we find that the impact of the national agroforestry policy has been limited; however, given smallholders’ preference for government programs, this trust can be leveraged to provide better financial and technical support. Overall, our study reinforces the finding that unless livelihoods are secured, engagement in restoration by smallholders is likely to remain limited, ultimately undermining the potential co-benefits of forest restoration to the most vulnerable.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nkajp_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/nkajp_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010240237255461193}, {"title": "“Circle A: Making Eurodance a Threat Again.” – Practice-Based Autoethnographic Reflections on Political Musicking", "authors": "Christina Fischer-Lessiak, Malik Sharif", "abstract": "tina and Malik are excited to be invited to talk about their music project Circle A at a practice-based research symposium on music, sounds, and the political. They founded Circle A in 2014 as the first Radical Eurodance act ever, with the self-declared mission of “making Eurodance a threat again” and framing it as “a four-to-the-floor declaration of war against any kind of injustice and oppression that haunts the world we live in.” Over the past few years, they have only occasionally performed or recorded, due to their time being taken up by kids, other bands, and a pandemic. In early 2024, they meet over a beer to revisit their joint work and think about the topics they would like to discuss at the symposium. They reminisce about when, how, and why they founded Circle A; how the band and its music developed; what the future may hold for it; how and to what ends they mixed Eurodance and politics; and what all of this has to do with their shared background in musicology. In the process, tina and Malik also engage in discussions about fundamental questions regarding the relationship between music and the political, such as: What makes music political? Who are the audiences of political music, and how do they influence musicians’ practices? What are criteria for deciding whether a piece of political music is “good,” or maybe rather: “successful”? Can (political) music change the world? If so, how and to what extent? How can the seriousness of social struggles be squared with humorous modes of artistic expression? – As the conversation unfolds, tina and Malik switch back and forth between spoken language and song. In the end, they fail to produce notes for their symposium presentation, but they certainly enjoyed the intellectually stimulating – and sometimes controversial – exchange.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rnkvm_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/rnkvm_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02447284628704971}, {"title": "Engineering Epistemic Churn: A Theory of Prolonged Meaning-Making Under Platform Conditions", "authors": "John Tapper, Carolyn Bronstein", "abstract": "This paper theorizes how platform infrastructures produce epistemic churn—a condition in which publics remain caught in unresolved cycles of interpretation. Unlike models centered on belief accuracy or convergence, epistemic churn explains how infrastructures govern not what is believed, but whether belief stabilizes at all. We argue that churn emerges from engineered turbulence—systemic interventions that modulate epistemic friction (the difficulty of reaching interpretive closure), delaying stabilization while sustaining engagement. To render churn empirically tractable, we propose a family of methods that can both test the theory and provide qualitative nuance on its mechanics. Situating churn within a broader theory of communicative governance, the paper reframes communication theory by showing how infrastructures sustain engagement by prolonging interpretive labor. Normatively, it shows how platforms govern not by silencing expression but by deferring belief formation, a subtle form of power with profound consequences for democratic life and collective agency.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vszxu_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vszxu_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004544948984685715}, {"title": "Investigating contributorship and the division of labor in international scientific collaboration", "authors": "Jie Xue, Vincent Larivière", "abstract": "International scientific collaboration has grown substantially, yet little is known about how scientific labor is organized within those.

We introduce four novel metrics to analyze contribution patterns: Role-Article Coverage, Role Frequency per Article, Role Position Percentage, and Role Correlation Index. Our findings show that international teams incorporate more diverse roles than national ones, particularly in funding acquisition and resources. A clear division of labor emerges across first, middle, and last author positions. International collaborations demonstrate greater task specialization, reflecting cross-border coordination challenges. Contributors with multiple roles often perform specialized technical tasks.

These incidents illustrate how, under the guise of technical neutrality, AI can reinforce dominant narratives, amplify disinformation, and undermine dissent. Drawing on a recently proposed framework for AI regulation (Tomić &amp; Štimac, 2025), we show how failures across three dimensions—decision models, data sourcing, and interface semantics—create pathways for political manipulation and reputational harm.

Utilizing the ArchMatNet agent-based model (ABM), we simulate the social behaviors of small-scale communities and their material culture production, enabling a comparative analysis of social and material culture networks. The networks were compared using a graph correlation method, and the underlying network structures were compared using ERGMs (Exponential Random Graph Models). Our results demonstrate strong correlations between social interaction networks and material culture networks, particularly when significant variation is present in material culture traits. The study also demonstrates that some circumstances, such as low material culture variation, can present poor correlations. Thus, there is some caution for the application of network methods to archaeological data. Key factors influencing these correlations include the frequency of interaction, learning strategies, and the visibility of cultural traits. The study underscores the complexity of using material culture as a proxy for social networks, emphasizing the importance of empirical validation and careful consideration of network structures. The findings highlight the potential of ABMs as a methodological tool in archaeology to explore and validate methodological tools.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wjsyg_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wjsyg_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.045437491519215056}, {"title": "The Intelligent Evolution of Open-Source Intelligence: Focusing on International Legion of Defence Intelligence of Ukraine", "authors": "WEI MENG", "abstract": "This study aims to deepen open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis of Ukraine's Defense Intelligence International Corps through artificial intelligence methods, exploring AI's application potential and methodological value in complex warfare information environments. The core objectives address two questions: First, how can AI technologies be effectively integrated into the OSINT cycle to enhance information screening, pattern recognition, and risk prediction? Second, can AI-driven OSINT provide more forward-looking and systematic support for strategic decision-making? Methodologically, this study adopts a multidisciplinary mixed methodology, integrating text metrology, semantic network analysis, risk radar modeling, and time-series projection to form a comprehensive framework: “Data Collection → AI Processing → Risk Assessment → Timeline Analysis → Insight Output.” The research process extensively leverages multilingual datasets (English, Ukrainian, Russian) and cross-platform information sources (official, media, social networks), utilizing visualization modeling to present data and risks in multidimensional formats. Results demonstrate that AI significantly enhances the depth and breadth of information processing in OSINT analysis. It outperforms traditional methods in misinformation detection accuracy, multilingual keyword extraction efficiency, and predictive power for risk patterns. Military risks and information warfare risks were assessed as highest priority, followed by public opinion risks and legal risks, revealing an overall “military-information warfare-public opinion” triple-high-risk configuration. Concurrently, time-series analysis revealed rhythmic patterns in risk evolution, providing quantitative foundations for future strategic planning. The study concludes that AI not only transforms OSINT's technical framework but also propels it toward structured, systematic, and forward-looking intelligence generation. AI-driven OSINT effectively bridges the tension between data fragmentation and systematic strategic analysis, enabling a qualitative leap in the intelligence cycle from “information accumulation” to “strategic insight.” This study provides an empirical paradigm for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and intelligence studies, holding significant theoretical and practical implications for future military conflicts, national security, and policy formulation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/y8nwk_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/y8nwk_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014438981247140492}, {"title": "Assessing Training Needs in the Global Bibliometrics Community", "authors": "Barbara S.
