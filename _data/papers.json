[{"title":"Military Service and Immigrants’ Integration: Evidence from the Vietnam Draft Lotteries","authors":"NAN ZHANG, MELISSA M. LEE","abstract":"Seminal theories in political science argue that military service is a critical driver of minority integration. However, a major obstacle bedeviling the study of military service is self-selection: individuals who are better integrated may be more likely to join the military in the first place. We address the selection problem by examining the effects of military conscription during the Vietnam War using an instrumental variables approach. Conscription during 1970–72 was decided on the basis of national draft lotteries that assigned draft numbers based on an individual’s date of birth. Using the draft lottery instrument, we find no evidence of a causal effect of military service on a range of integration outcomes from the 2000 decennial census. At least for the Vietnam era, the link between service and long-term integration is largely driven by self-selection, which points to important scope conditions for the integrationist view.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s000305542500019x","doi":"10.1017/s000305542500019x","journal_full":"American Political Science Review","dist":0.6284,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"A New Measure of Affective Polarization","authors":"NICOLAS CAMPOS, CHRISTOPHER FEDERICO","abstract":"Affective polarization has emerged as an important construct in the literature on partisanship. However, most efforts to measure it have relied on simple preexisting indices, potentially missing the complexity of affective polarization. In this article, we address these concerns by reconceptualizing and deriving a new measure of affective polarization. Drawing on the notion of political sectarianism and other lines of research in political behavior and social psychology, we develop and validate a novel multidimensional measure of affective polarization consisting of three parts: othering, aversion, and moralization. Our analyses yield a valid and reliable nine-item measure with three subdimensions. These subdimensions and the full scale broadly correlate with various measures of political identity, anti-democratic elite action, and political violence. Importantly, we find that the subdimensions have different patterns of correlation with key criterion variables, suggesting that othering, aversion, and moralization are distinct components of affective polarization.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425000255","doi":"10.1017/s0003055425000255","journal_full":"American Political Science Review","dist":0.4881,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Selecting the ‘Best’? Competing Dimensions of Politician Quality in the Developing World","authors":"Ananish Chaudhuri, Vegard Iversen, Francesca R. Jensenius, Pushkar Maitra","abstract":"Evidence suggests that politicians in advanced democracies are positively selected on characteristics relevant to their suitability for political office. Whereas stereotypes abound, much less is known about the quality of politicians in developing countries. Drawing on unique experimental and survey data on village-level politicians in West Bengal, India, we find some evidence of positive selection into office: elected politicians are more educated, motivated, and have greater integrity than their constituents. However, they also have lower cognitive ability and are more likely to come from politically networked families. Comparing first-timers with re-elected politicians, we observe that experienced politicians display somewhat more political knowledge and motivation than their inexperienced peers, but are also more likely to be wealthy and male. Our findings demonstrate that conclusions about politician quality depend critically on measurement choices and that there may be competing dimensions of politician quality in the developing world.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425000225","doi":"10.1017/s0007123425000225","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.5013,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Defending the Status Quo or Seeking Change? Electoral Outcomes, Affective Polarization, and Support for Referendums","authors":"Bjarn Eck, Emilien Paulis","abstract":"Voters of governing parties are more satisfied with democracy than opposition voters, but the consequences of this winner-loser gap remain underexplored. We argue that electoral losers should be more supportive of referendums than electoral winners as representative democracy has failed electoral losers, whereas electoral winners aim to protect their party’s ability to govern without constraint. In addition, we theorize that affective polarization should strengthen this gap. Using cross-national survey data from thirteen European democracies, we find that electoral losers consistently show greater support for referendums than winners, and affective polarization amplifies this effect. Yet, the effect of affective polarization is solely attributed to a decrease in support for referendums among polarized election winners. These findings raise questions about the role of affective polarization in undermining the accountability mechanism between electoral winners and their parties. Concerns about electoral losers might be overstated and potentially overlook the democratic implications of electoral victory.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425000365","doi":"10.1017/s0007123425000365","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.5422,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gendered Expectations: Do Voters Reward Women for Supporting Women’s Interests?","authors":"Nichole M.

We marshal an original content analysis of cable news coverage and two survey experiments testing voters’ assessment of hypothetical legislators on the issues of abortion and equal pay.

We also find that women voters negatively evaluate women legislators who act against women’s interests at a greater rate than men voters.

This trend has consequences. We argue that certain member states are incentivized by the benefits of partaking in complex missions. These include ‘process’ benefits such as reimbursement payments, training, and reputation building. Specifically, non-democratic states are more likely to make greater contributions to missions with complex mandates than democratic states. In a global analysis of UN member peacekeeping contributions from 1990 to 2022, we show that as mandate complexity increases, non-democracies make larger contributions relative to democracies. While democracies do not shy away from supporting peacekeeping, they resist substantial contributions to the ambitiously mandated missions that they have often themselves promoted. These findings contribute to ongoing academic discussions about the challenge of recruiting sufficient resources to pursue peacekeeping while insisting on a liberal global order.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425000316","doi":"10.1017/s0007123425000316","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.3733,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Inflation, Blame Attribution, and the 2022 US Congressional Elections","authors":"Leonardo Baccini, Stephen Weymouth","abstract":"This study investigates the impact of inflation on the 2022 US mid-term elections, a period witnessing the resurgence of inflation as a major concern in the USA for the first time in decades. We develop a pre-registered survey with an embedded experiment to examine the political repercussions of rising prices. We find that individuals experiencing a higher personal inflation burden are more inclined to support Republican candidates. Our survey experiment further assesses the impact of partisan messaging leading up to the election, focusing on two primary narratives: government spending, as emphasized by Republicans, and corporate greed, highlighted by Democrats. The results indicate that attributing inflation to government spending decreases support for Democrats, whereas associating it with corporate greed undermines confidence in the Republicans’ ability to effectively manage inflation.

However, several factors, such as corporate prioritization of social values, changes in trade policy, and anti-business sentiment among Republican rank-and-file, suggest a coalitional shift is underway. Scholars have debated whether this shift is an illusion or is real. At the core of this debate is how businesses navigate two forms of organizational conflict: a) stakeholder cross-pressure and b) policy cross-pressure . To measure cross-pressure, we conduct an original survey of elite business leaders. Our evidence suggests a widespread view that companies are increasingly aligned with the Democrats, including in alignment on core policy priorities. When companies are cross-pressured, leaders perceive the company as leaning toward the Democrats. The potential decoupling of business from the Republican coalition represents one of the most significant changes in American politics in decades.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007123425000304","doi":"10.1017/s0007123425000304","journal_full":"British Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4875,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do Culturally Embedded Political Leaders Help or Hinder Economic Development?","authors":"Xiaojun Yan, La Li","abstract":"Previous research presents conflicting views on whether cultural similarities between state officials and the societies they govern promote or hinder economic growth. We posit that cultural embeddedness can facilitate local growth by reducing the transaction costs for alleviating the credible commitment problem, thereby efficiently diminishing the uncertainty for production and investment. Using linguistic similarity as a proxy for cultural embeddedness, we find that the Chinese municipalities governed by political leaders whose cultural background is similar to that of the local society exhibit significantly stronger economic growth. Further, the appointment of a new political leader typically dampens business performance due to local enterprises’ inclination to avoid risks, but this effect is absent when the incoming leaders are culturally embedded. We also demonstrate that in the institutional setting of modern states, cultural connection serves as a “weak tie” that efficiently facilitate state-society communication of credible commitment, but are inadequate to foster corruption.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251342920","doi":"10.1177/00104140251342920","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.4942,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"“Stand by Those who Share our Values” – How Refugees Fleeing the Taliban Improved European Attitudes Toward Immigration","authors":"Joris Frese","abstract":"Several existing studies have found that negative political framing of immigrants increases anti-immigrant public attitudes.

I argue that when refugees are framed as vulnerable, assimilable, and deserving of help, this should cause a reduction in anti-immigrant sentiment. In the first study, analyzing the case of the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, I demonstrate such deservingness frames with computational and qualitative text analyses of news archival data and social media posts by political elites. In the second study, I show with an unexpected event during survey design that the positive framing of refugees during this highly salient event led to a significant immediate and long-term increase in pro-immigration attitudes across Europe. Together, these findings suggest that it is possible for politicians and journalists to effectively reduce xenophobia during large-scale refugee arrivals by highlighting refugees’ vulnerability and assimilability.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251342915","doi":"10.1177/00104140251342915","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.6619,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Nonstate Actor Inclusion and the Social Legitimacy of Global Governance Institutions","authors":"Matthias Ecker-Ehrhardt, Soetkin Verhaegen, Sigrid Quack","abstract":"Nonstate actors play powerful roles in global governance institutions (GGIs) as advocates, experts, representatives, regulators, monitors, and implementing agents.

In this contribution, we theoretically argue that such inclusion effectively enhances the social legitimacy of GGIs, but only to the extent that citizens expect nonstate actors to provide relevant governance contributions. We find strong empirical evidence for this argument in two large-N conjoint experiments fielded in Brazil, Germany, South Africa, and the United States. First, our results suggest that citizens, on average, ascribe more legitimacy to GGIs if learning that nonstate actors have a say in important decisions. Second, the strength of this effect depends on the degree to which citizens expect nonstate actors to provide expertise, representation, public interest orientation, transparency, or operational capacity. Third, expected governance contributions remarkably vary among different types of nonstate actors in kind and degree. In line with our overall argument, findings suggest that nonstate actor participation plays a more complex and significant role in the social legitimation of global governance than previously understood.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/isq/sqaf040","doi":"10.1093/isq/sqaf040","journal_full":"International Studies Quarterly","dist":0.4366,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Prodigal Child Returns?

Return migration is known to be a boon for the local economy and a catalyst for political reform. However, these effects are conditional on successful reintegration, which is dependent on the preferences of nonmigrants. What causes negative attitudes towards return migration, given its significant potential economic benefits? I argue that nonmigrants are concerned about both the economic and political competition of returnees. Nonmigrants prefer to welcome back migrants who can bring financial capital and employment back home, but will oppose competitors on the job market when unemployment is high. Furthermore, nonmigrants are concerned about the potential role of return migrants as norm entrepreneurs.

To measure these perceptions, I apply a conjoint experiment with a multinomial outcome, in which respondents are asked to categorize hypothetical immigrants as coming from one of the five regions. Results from a nationally diverse sample demonstrate that immigrants from all regions other than Europe are associated with speaking poor English.

This gap emerges early in life and could be influenced by gender norms learned through socialization, in the family or at school. Using a natural experiment in high school assignment in South Korea, we examine whether an all-female school environment can contribute to narrowing the gender gap by increasing women’s civic and political participation and fostering their ambition for leadership. We find that female graduates of single-sex schools are more engaged in politics and society and more likely to pursue leadership positions compared to women who graduated from coeducational schools. These effects are durable, lasting for years, even decades. However, single-sex schools do not cultivate more progressive gender attitudes among women, so increased female participation need not imply greater activism for gender equality.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/xps.2025.6","doi":"10.1017/xps.2025.6","journal_full":"Journal of Experimental Political Science","dist":0.5592,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Women’s roles and reproductive violence within armed rebellions","authors":"Lindsey A Goldberg","abstract":"Why do armed rebel movements perpetrate intragroup reproductive violence? While extant research predominantly focuses on wartime sexual violence against civilians, the targeting of rebel women with reproductive violence remains underexplored. My research contributes new insights on how women’s idealized roles within armed rebellions shape the likelihood of these groups engaging in various forms of intragroup reproductive violence. I theorize that forced abortions are more likely to occur within rebellions that idealize women’s contributions through masculine duties like frontline combat because in these cases, pregnancy is perceived as antithetical to women’s expected contributions to the rebel movement. Conversely, forced pregnancies are more likely to occur within rebel movements that idealize women’s feminine support roles away from the frontlines because in these cases, pregnancy and motherhood are often part of rebel women’s expected contributions. I provide illustrative examples of armed rebellions characterized by these dynamics, and I introduce novel data on intragroup reproductive violence across a global sample of rebel organizations.

Although existing research has argued that sanctioned countries reduce their military spending in absolute terms, it is unclear whether they do trade more guns for butter in relative terms. We argue that in the short run, sanctioned states have an incentive to channel proportionally more resources to the military for two primary reasons. First, this allows them to signal their resolve not to back down to sanctioning states and potentially maintain their bargaining leverage. Second, higher relative military spending can strengthen leaders’ hold on power by improving their ability to co-opt and repress political opponents. However, this combined incentive to signal resolve and consolidate power weakens after the initial economic and political shocks. As such, we also expect that the increase in relative military spending will diminish gradually. To test our theory, we propose a new measurement of sanction shocks that carefully accounts for the salience, costs, and duration of different sanction episodes. Using this measure, we apply dynamic panel modeling to examine the military spending of 166 countries from 1962 to 2015. We find strong support for our theoretical expectations. In response to sanction shocks, target states choose to spend proportionally more on the military; this increase peaks in the first few years and dissipates over time. These results hold important implications for research on both economic sanctions and military spending.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251331486","doi":"10.1177/00223433251331486","journal_full":"Journal of Peace Research","dist":0.4711,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"War, social preferences, and anti-outgroup behavior: Experimental evidence from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine","authors":"Sam Whitt, Douglas Page","abstract":"How does war affect social preferences toward people with conflict-related outgroup identities?

We consider the case of Ukraine, where many people with Russian identity markers reside. We ask whether people in Ukraine who identify as Russian by ethnicity or language have become stigmatized following Russia’s invasion. To measure social preferences, we introduce a variant of the Equality Equivalency Test (EET) as a third-party dictator game, where respondents decide between equal or unequal allocations of money involving two recipients. We run the EET in a January 2023 nationwide survey in Ukraine where dictator recipients are randomized by Ukrainian and Russian ethnicity, language, and/or Ukrainian civic identity. We also randomize priming on conflict-related victimization experiences. Despite widespread devastation across Ukraine by Russian forces, the majority of respondents, who identify as ethnic Ukrainians, treat Russian identifiers benevolently (fairly) relative to Ukrainians, and only a minority of respondents behaved malevolently (spitefully) toward them. Priming on victimization has minimal negative effects on benevolence.

We find that center-right parties have been reluctant to address high inequality and demands for equal rights, while many far-right parties have surpassed them in promoting economic equality and even support for equal rights. As an important qualification, we show that far-right parties support equal rights often in abstracto ; without specifying groups.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/13540688251339625","doi":"10.1177/13540688251339625","journal_full":"Party Politics","dist":0.5095,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"AI and the Bomb: Nuclear Strategy and Risk in the Digital Age.

However, less attention has been given to how to counter such support. One possible route for pro-democratic forces to counter anti-democratic tendencies is telling people that democracy is vulnerable and at risk of breaking down. In this paper, I examine this straightforward intervention against support for undemocratic politicians. Specifically, I prime democratic vulnerability and assign undemocratic behavior to political candidates in two experimental studies from 2020 to 2021 including 10 countries in total. I find that vulnerability priming only in few cases increases the extent to which citizens sanction undemocratic behavior. The findings have important implications for our knowledge of how to counter democratic backsliding and show that pro-democratic forces may be better off resorting to other arguments.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10044-4","doi":"10.1007/s11109-025-10044-4","journal_full":"Political Behavior","dist":0.5248,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Tipping point urbanism: A study of the painting and fading of the macromural La Mariposa in governing self-built settlements in Bogotá","authors":"Petr Vašát","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.polgeo.2025.103337","doi":"10.1016/j.polgeo.2025.103337","journal_full":"Political Geography","dist":0.4421,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The geography of intent: The bodily implications of border surveillance technologies","authors":"Samuel N.

Minority stress, multisystemic resilience, and identity among Roma people in Germany","authors":"Kirsty Campbell, Timothy Williams","abstract":"Roma people in Germany pursue different practices in terms of “coming out” with their Roma identity in mainstream German society, with some people concealing their identity for fear of discrimination, others disclosing it openly, and others selectively disclosing it in specific contexts while masking in others. Given the historic marginalization and ongoing discrimination that Roma people experience in Germany, it is puzzling why anyone decides to disclose their identity as Roma within a hostile environment. This article addresses this puzzle by drawing on queer approaches on how coming out can positively affect dealing with minority stress that has been induced by discrimination and bringing it into conversation with the idea of multisystemic resilience, highlighting that identity disclosure can have different effects for resilience in different systems of discrimination and resulting minority stress. Empirically, we draw on data from a participant action research project and identify three main effects that determine why individuals make choices to disclose or mask their identities as Roma: individual learning whereby people learn from past experiences of discrimination and coming out; self‐confidence developed as a result of pride in one's identity; and intergenerational learning whereby people follow the identity disclosure practices of their parents and grandparents.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70040","doi":"10.1111/pops.70040","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.4879,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Demanding more than what you want","authors":"Zuheir Desai, Scott A.

We develop a theory of electoral competition focusing on politicians who differ in terms of both ideological preferences and in their capability to “get things done.” An imperfect ability to implement platforms introduces a novel role for status quo policies. We first show that the traditional left-right orientation of political competition arises only when the status quo is relatively moderate. Otherwise, an extreme status quo becomes the dominant dimension of electoral competition, providing a novel rationale for “populist” campaigns. Our second set of results address when campaign platforms can serve as effective empirical proxies for policies. We show that when there is a shock to voter preferences, the effect on platforms and policies is qualitatively the same, hence platforms are good qualitative proxies for policy implications. But when shocks are to the platform-policy linkage, platforms and policies respond in qualitatively different ways.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.25","doi":"10.1017/psrm.2025.25","journal_full":"Political Science Research and Methods","dist":0.4159,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Rational gridlock","authors":"Scott Baker, Michael D.

The institutional designer maximizes voter welfare. We find that the optimal arrangement consists of two lawmaking institutions that must agree to enact any reforms. The institutions do not share preferences with one another or with the median voter. As a result, gridlock arises: the institutions reject some reforms that the median voter favors. However, when reform succeeds, it tends to be modest in scope and to more closely track what the median voter prefers. The optimal institutional design trades off the cost of failing to change law due to gridlock against the benefit of forcing advocates to moderate their proposals and offer more centrist reforms. Surprisingly, voters are best served by a pair of polarized and unrepresentative institutions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01264-7","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01264-7","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.3895,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Different Standards: Observing Variation in Citizens’ Respect-Based Norms for Mediated Political Communication","authors":"Emma Turkenburg, Ine Goovaerts, Sofie Marien","abstract":"Incivility, oversimplification, lying, inaccessible language: there is widespread concern and controversy about the disrespectful ways politicians communicate. The reasoning underlying these worries is that such communication violates widely shared communicative norms, and that exposure to it may lead to adverse consequences in the wider public. However, widespread support for respect-based norms among citizens is generally presupposed, and little is known about the extent to which norm support matters in how people react when witnessing disrespectful politicians. Using Belgian survey data (N = 2,030), we investigate whether citizens differ in the degree to which they support different respect-based norms for mediated elite communication, and whether differing levels of norm support moderate the relationship between perceived norm violations and several political outcomes (affect toward politicians; political trust; talking about politics; political information seeking). The results reveal substantial variation in norm support across the population, with differences based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., education level) and political attitudes (cynical, populist, polarized attitudes). This variation, moreover, matters. While depending on the outcome and norms we study, several findings show that citizens supporting respect-based norms react more negatively when perceiving norm violations more frequently, as compared to citizens caring less about these norms. Yet, whether and in what way this moderating effect occurs can differ for different types of disrespect. As such, besides showing that respectful communication is not equally important to everyone and that not everyone reacts to norm breaking in the same way, this study also underlines that not all shades of disrespect should be tarred with the same brush.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf001","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf001","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5009,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Measuring (Sub-)National Identities in Survey Research: Lessons from Belgium","authors":"Dave Sinardet, Lieven De Winter, Christoph Niessen, Jérémy Dodeigne, Min Reuchamps","abstract":"This article explores different measurements of (sub-)national identities in survey research and examines to what extent they lead to different results. Using survey data from Belgium, where there is a long-standing tradition of (sub-)national identity surveys, three types of questions are scrutinized: the “hierarchical” question (asking respondents to which of a list of given identities they feel most closely related in first and second place), the “Linz-Moreno” question (asking respondents to situate their regional and national identities vis-à-vis each other), and the more recent “metric” question (asking respondents to situate themselves on distinct eleven-point scales for multiple identities). This article analyzes the extent to which respondents answer these questions consistently, how varying degrees of consistency can be explained, and what this tells us about the way social scientists measure (sub-)national identities. The results show that, depending on the question, only 39.4 percent to 69.2 percent of the respondents answered the three (sub-)national identity questions consistently. Differences in consistency are found to be not only related to respondents’ political knowledge and interest, but also to the question forms and wording, leading us to reflect on the validity of identity measurements.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfae066","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfae066","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5138,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gender, Ethnicity, and Intersectionality: Double-Minorities in Asian Cabinets","authors":"Keith Padraic Chew, Amy H Liu","url":"https://doi.org/10.1086/736696","doi":"10.1086/736696","journal_full":"The Journal of Politics","dist":0.4173,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Socialization, Self-Selection, and the Life Experiences of World Leaders: Why Business Experience Influences Defense Spending","authors":"Matthew Fuhrmann, James D.

Despite Gu’s unprecedented achievement, her identity drew controversy in China. This comparative study of media discourses on Gu reveals how Chinese identity is contested in a global context. The analysis suggests that state-owned and social media use different rhetoric to discuss Gu’s Chinese identity as either a state of being or a process of becoming. State-owned media highlight Chinese identity as a “being” by emphasizing Gu’s kinship and cultural ties to China, thus acknowledging her essentialized identity as a Chinese. Social media, represented by Zhihu , underscore Chinese identity as a “becoming” that is not only based on connections to China but also on reiterated performances of Chinese culture and commitment. Social media users largely negate Gu’s Chinese identity due to her perceived failure to provide sufficient evidence that she has become Chinese. The two modes of rhetoric reflect the state’s and ordinary citizens’ respective relationships with global elites, which have shaped their varied framings of Gu.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251341708","doi":"10.1177/01634437251341708","journal_full":"Media, Culture & Society","dist":0.4296,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"“I remember, I saw, I knew”: Journalists’ use of first-person storytelling in award-winning podcasts","authors":"Jessica Pettengill","abstract":"This study focuses on first-person storytelling in six United States, award-winning podcast series.

A royalty share is a form of securitized music copyright that is packaged and sold as an investment asset to buyers on royalty sharing marketplaces (RSMs). Royalty shares represent an evolutionary step in financialization of music markets that contributes to deepening inequalities by transforming copyright ownership, introducing new kinds of socio-legal obligations between musicians and financial rentiers, and shifting the way recorded music is valued. Drawing on field ethnography at music industry trade events, qualitative interviews with RSM executives, and document analysis of corporate communication and music business trade press, this article answers the question: to what extent does the rise of assetized music copyrights traded on RSMs contribute to inequality for musicians. This article argues that the assetization of musical copyrights introduces new legal frameworks to exploit musicians while maintaining existing inequalities and poor working conditions in the music industries. The conclusion reflects on the consequences of royalty shares becoming more normalized in music markets and indicates directions for future research into the assetization of cultural production.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251341715","doi":"10.1177/01634437251341715","journal_full":"Media, Culture & Society","dist":0.4062,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do They Even Care?

While this phenomenon has been studied in for example news media and social movements, we know less about its influence on civil society organizations, despite their pluralism being a centerpiece in a vibrant democracy. More specifically, we do not know if social media make civil society organizations more isomorphic and thus decreasing the diversity of their emotional communication over time. This question is relevant given the broad range of organizational fields that civil society engages in, as well as the documented push toward especially extreme positivity on social media platforms. Given this background, the article explores the use of positive and negative sentiment, as well as of sentiment intensity, over time in the social media communication of different organizational fields of civil society. We employ sentiment analysis to analyze approximately 100,000 organizational posts on Facebook from 125 Swedish nonprofit organizations during 2015–2020. We find that the pluralism of civil society organizations across different fields, as regards emotional communication, is retained over time, thus not threatening the pluralism of civil society in this way. In addition, emotional communication, and especially positivity, increases over time in all fields in absolute terms. However, considering post length, the relative amount of emotional communication exhibits less of an increase. Rather, across all fields there is an unexpected isomorphism relating to posts becoming longer, while enticing less user engagement. This development, rather than the lack of pluralism, raises democratic concerns.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251337220","doi":"10.1177/20563051251337220","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4874,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Like, Share, Lead: The Impact of Social Media on Authority and Legitimacy in the Labor Movement","authors":"Mark Friis Hau","abstract":"This article draws on the theories of Max Weber to explore how social media can redefine organization and hierarchy in the contemporary labor movement.

Analyzing Levels of Polarization in the German Twitter/X Debates on “Fridays for Future” and “Letzte Generation”","authors":"Hendrik Meyer, Louisa Pröschel, Michael Brüggemann","abstract":"Examining how different forms of climate protest affect social media debates is critical to understanding their role within societal climate policy discourse. This study compares debates surrounding disruptive and non-disruptive movements on Twitter/X, asking to what extent they lead to ideologically and affectively polarized networks. We analyzed debates around two prominent German climate movements—Fridays for Future and Last Generation—using automated content and network analyses ( N = ~5,000,000) and manual content analyses ( N = 2,830) of data compiled during 2022 and 2023. In doing so, we identified the types of events, (extreme) frames, users, and interactions that shape the structure of the online debates. The results reveal polarized networks in both debates, with the climate protesters’ antagonists driving discursive polarization. The Last Generation debate, however, has a significantly higher number of antagonistic users, more extreme frames, more toxic cross-group interactions, and less diverse network clusters. Last Generation generated higher individual user engagement, suggesting that debates about disruptive protests are effective at attracting attention, albeit at the cost of distracting from climate policy and expanding antagonistic networks. This debate was more polarized than that around Fridays for Future, dividing users into opposing camps, with fewer political and journalistic actors being on the protesters’ side. Thus, the disruptive protests unleashed two types of connective action: a supportive network that defended the protesters and their goals more extensively than during non-disruptive protests, and an antagonistic backlash network driven by what we term “connective counteraction.”","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251337400","doi":"10.1177/20563051251337400","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4774,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Spaces of Hybridized Prefatory Extremism (HYPE) on Social Media","authors":"Line Nybro Petersen, Mikkel Bækby Johansen","abstract":"New trends in online extremism are currently unsettling the typical classifications used to assess violent threats to democratic societies. While extremism is usually perceived to be a matter of extreme ideologies and methods, social media enables and shapes distinct hybridization processes by which conspiracy beliefs, personal grievances, and various ad hoc convictions are combined with ideology fragments, consequently producing new extremist narratives. However, research into hybridized extremism has not yet accounted for the specific role of digital platforms and social media. This article develops the concept of hybridized prefatory extremism (HYPE) spaces to account for these recent changes and offers a heuristic framework for future studies to pinpoint the participatory engagement of digital publics in co-creating hybrid forms of extremism which may evolve into violent extremism. Based on five quantitative and five qualitative datasets collected through digital ethnography, the article identifies three domains, which shape HYPE spaces: (1) actors , (2) practices , and (3) content . Through these three domains, we are able to point to how emerging processes of hybridization of extremism are not only a matter of content hybridity, but also a hybridity of technologies, aesthetics, and participation. The conceptualization of HYPE spaces allows researchers and practitioners to carry out further empirical studies to elucidate the distinct role of social media in current trends of extremism and identify and monitor potential risks of hostile and violent action in online spaces.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251340145","doi":"10.1177/20563051251340145","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4789,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Do digital platform's unethical behaviors influence users' trust and intention to use alternative platforms?","authors":"Jungyong Ahn, Seongcheol Kim","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102996","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102996","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.2991,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"On the verge of a digital divide in the use of generative AI?","authors":"David Suárez, Begoña García-Mariñoso","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102997","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102997","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.2552,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Are we there yet?

Using a difference-in-differences design that leverages variation in union affiliation to this federation, we find that “bargaining for women” increased female-friendly amenities in collective bargaining agreements and in practice. These changes led women to queue for jobs at treated establishments and separate from them less—both revealed preference measures of firm value. We find no evidence that gains came at the expense of wages, employment, or firm profits. Better amenities instead reduced turnover and absenteeism, suggesting greater worker satisfaction and effort. Larger improvements occurred where women initially comprised a lower share of workers or union leaders. Our findings show that shifting union priorities toward women improved workplaces without meaningful trade-offs and instead benefited both workers and employers.

In terms of past African mobility, forced emigration through the slave trade, with its nefarious characteristics and long-lasting legacies, has also received much publicity. But what happened to African mobility in the long century between the demise of the trans-oceanic slave trades after 1850 and the gradual resurgence of African extra-continental migration since 1960? This paper adopts the concept of the “Age of Intra-African Migration” to analyze a distinct epoch of widespread and large-scale African mobility, characterized by a succession of overlapping transitions in continent-wide migration patterns. We identify five of these transitions and explain their drivers. Overall, we show that the inward shift of African migration patterns was a consequence of intensified state formation, the demise of the transoceanic slave trades, and export-oriented commercialization. These processes were in turn shaped by trade integration, industrialization and imperialism on a global scale. As such, the Age of Intra-African Migration did not signify a retreat of Africans from global migration altogether, but rather the growing importance of migration destinations across the continent itself. We contend that the ongoing globalization of African diasporas cannot be fully understood without accounting for the dynamics of regional mobility between 1850 and 1960, and that, contrary to popular belief, Africans today are not any more mobile than they were a century ago.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00448-w","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00448-w","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5385,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Genocide and enslavement","authors":"Scott Straus","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2504624","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2504624","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.2229,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"“I think it’s a very nasty question”: Trumpian anti-Black racism and the limits of traditional journalistic standards","authors":"Chad Rhym, Laura Garbes","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2501751","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2501751","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.3507,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Symposium on Marcel Paret’s Fractured Militancy: Precarious Resistance in South Africa after Racial Inclusion","authors":"John Solomos","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2501125","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2501125","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.3888,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Assisted return programmes across Europe – Mapping an increasingly obscure landscape","authors":"Lukas M.

Our article contributes to this under-researched area by examining how return migrants view future migration, based on 97 in-depth interviews with Romanian returnees from four European countries. We focus on young, working-age returnees, who are nevertheless well settled in their work and domestic lives. Comparisons between “then” and “now” are at the heart of participants’ reflections and draw attention to two temporal dimensions that become entangled in their future mobility considerations: prior migration experience, and life-course transformations. We show how returnees’ experiences of difficult and precarious work conditions, marginalization, and social isolation abroad, place important limits on migrating again, and generate specific parameters for future mobility, in conjunction with present family commitments and life-stage norms and aspirations. Future migration is thus often conditioned on preserving family unity and “decent” work opportunities, which reflect one's skills but also protect one's economic stability and wellbeing. The findings advance understanding of return and migration aspirations more broadly. Contrary to common assumptions, they show that prior migration experience does not simply facilitate but can also temper and recalibrate future migration aspirations, in conjunction with life-stage considerations. The findings additionally enrich the understanding of intra-European mobility dynamics, bringing in returnees’ perspectives, and revealing important temporal limits to European free mobility.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251337023","doi":"10.1177/01979183251337023","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5852,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Book Review: Sin Padres, Ni Papeles CanizalesStephanie L.2024.

To assess the efficacy of this program in attracting and retaining migrants, we apply survival analysis to administrative longitudinal microdata from the Person Level Integrated Data Asset linked to census data from 2010 to 2020. We find that this program attracts few new migrants to regional Australia given that over 80% of regional visa holders applied onshore. Furthermore, close to 65% were already in a nonmetropolitan region for an average of 2 years while the remainder took on average 7 months to relocate to a nonmetropolitan area from overseas or from within Australia. While nonmetropolitan retention is high — 70% after 10 years — it is significantly lower in remote and very remote regions, and it is lower than the Australian population at large, suggesting limited policy efficacy in retaining rural populations in the long term. We also identify a negative selection, with migrants with low English proficiency being more likely to remain in nonmetropolitan regions, which suggests a possible segmentation of nonmetropolitan labor markets where migrants are concentrated in low-wage sectors. Two policy levers emerge to improve retention: (1) targeting co-ethnic communities and (2) focusing on young families with children. The mixed results from this policy evaluation highlight the difficulties of stimulating nonmetropolitan population growth via immigration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251330275","doi":"10.1177/01979183251330275","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5831,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Longitudinal Relationship Between Acculturation and Alcohol Use Among Immigrant Adolescents in Europe","authors":"Krzysztof Czaderny","abstract":"This study examines the relationship between alcohol use among immigrant adolescents living in Europe and their sense of national belonging as well as the ethnic composition of their friendship networks, contributing to the broader discussion on the healthy immigrant effect. To date, the majority of longitudinal studies examining the relationship between acculturation and alcohol use have been conducted in the United States. This study employs a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, analyzing data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries . The sample includes 5,235 adolescents with an immigrant background living in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The findings of this study indicate that identification as a foreigner was negatively related to alcohol use over time, whereas identification with the host country was positively associated with alcohol use longitudinally. In line with the immigrant acculturation hypothesis, the proportion of friends from the ethnic background of the host country was longitudinally positively associated with alcohol use. A similar pattern of relationships was observed for alcohol misuse. As demonstrated in the two-part analysis, identification as a foreigner, identification with the host country, and ethnic composition of friendship networks were primarily associated with the initiation of alcohol use rather than the frequency of alcohol use among immigrant adolescents. In conclusion, the promotion of selective acculturation among this group is recommended, especially in view of the increased health risks associated with alcohol use due to immigrants’ lower propensity to utilize preventive healthcare.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251333767","doi":"10.1177/01979183251333767","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.6055,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Education Abroad and Income Paradox: A Research Note","authors":"Wei Liu","abstract":"Youths of a country seem to be less interested in going abroad when the per capita GDP of the country reaches a certain level.

Pervasive across these are how best to conduct research “with” rather than “on” migrants as its primary object of study. Though it is frequently emphasized that alternative framings in knowledge production based on the lived experiences of migrants are vital in migration research, many scholars highlight how their voices continue to remain at the margins. If such perspectives continue to be sidelined, while maintaining that they are essential for necessary changes to how migration research is conducted, then researchers need to reflect on how they can operationalize methodologies that enable more meaningful engagement with migrants in practice. Drawing on a decade of experience working directly with and alongside migrants in diverse settings, this paper reflects on the convergence of academia and practice. We emphasize that a participatory approach, when holistically applied in conducting empirical research with migrants, can better enable researchers to transcend many common challenges, provide a space for knowledge co-production, and often result in more ethical and quality research overall. The most crucial aspect for researchers to consider is how the participatory approach is both conceptualized and subsequently applied in practice. Participatory research does not necessarily need to be considered as a novel or standalone method as such but as a way to approach research that can underpin or be embedded into a multitude of migration research projects and designs, often complementing other methodologies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251325203","doi":"10.1177/01979183251325203","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5497,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Book Review: ID Wars in Côte d'Ivoire BanégasRichardArmandoCutolo. 2024.

Scholarship, particularly from West Bengal, India, reveals that dominant narratives have largely ignored caste-based differences in the experiences of displacement and rehabilitation, creating homogenized national memories. Official narratives often portrayed Partition as a necessary cost of independence, with refugees being blamed for their own plight. In response, upper(ed)-caste male refugees constructed a counter-narrative of victimhood and struggle, asserting their rights to citizenship. This narrative, coupled with rising communist influence, positioned refugees as the new proletariat in Leftist politics, erasing distinctions of caste, class, and gender. State policies on refugee rehabilitation, however, were often caste-blind or actively discriminatory, further marginalizing lowered-caste refugees. This paper explores these dynamics through an ethnographic study in Asansol, West Bengal. The lowered-caste migrants, relocated to Asansol to serve as cheap labour for industrial development, faced ongoing hardship, exacerbated by industrial closures and labour informalization. Women from these families, excluded from formal labour, were forced into devalued, caste-based work, a pattern that has persisted across generations. The structures of caste, then, have rendered lowered-caste refugee families as marginalized ‘quasi-citizens.’ Unlike upper(ed)-caste refugees, they have struggled to overcome the consequences of Partition and become integrated as ‘successful’ citizens; in a context where the degree of citizenship has been increasingly defined as being inversely proportional to one's economic dependence on the government and directly proportional to one's performance of ‘caste-moral respectability’. But, in a teleological fashion, their insufficient capacity to display adequate citizenship has only reinforced their de-valuation as labourers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251333760","doi":"10.1177/01979183251333760","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5575,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"A multi-level mixed-methods research design in studying localised experiences of asylum seekers: challenges and lessons learned","authors":"Antoine Roblain, Alessandro Mazzola, Emanuele Politi","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487744","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487744","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.4843,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Constructing difference in postsocialist Britain: the role of historical memory in media narratives of German and Polish migrants","authors":"Charlotte Galpin, Maren Rohe","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505219","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505219","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.5066,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Digital by default: the literacies, legibilities and legacies of the UK’s post-Brexit EU settled status regime","authors":"Kathy Burrell, Anna Key, Kate Botterill","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505706","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505706","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.459,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Behind the scenes: a (self) critical reflection on doing mixed methods","authors":"Samira Azabar, Peter Thijssen","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487742","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487742","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.3393,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Transformation in the use of mixed methods for migration-related research","authors":"Cesar Eduardo Merlín-Escorza","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487743","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2487743","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.5057,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Emotion work and the children of the Chilean exile, 50 years on","authors":"Verónica Díaz Cerda","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505704","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505704","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.408,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Explaining re-migration preferences among assisted returnees: evidence from Discrete Choice Experiments in Sudan, Somalia, and Ethiopia","authors":"Jasper Tjaden, Ulf Liebe, Davide Bruscoli","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505708","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2505708","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.5924,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gatekeepers or agents of change?

Paul, Courtney J. Nava","abstract":"In the United States, the public does not view all refugee groups with equal favorability. Why do individuals express more support for some refugee groups compared to others? We argue that some Americans are more supportive of certain refugee groups when they share a racial identity because it is easier for them to empathize with them. While recent research points to empathy as a useful tool for cultivating supportive attitudes toward refugees and immigrants, the political science literature lacks a nuanced understanding of the conditions under which empathy drives pro-social attitudes toward refugees, specifically with regard to racial dynamics. Does empathy allow people to overcome their racial ingroup preferences, or does it magnify them? With an original web experiment administered to a 50/50 Black and white sample of Americans, we prime half of the sample to associate refugees with their racial ingroup and prime the other half with their racial outgroup. We find that refugee race only affects support for refugees among white individuals with low group empathy. For high-empathy whites and Blacks of all levels of empathy, the race linked to refugees does not condition their support for refugees. Rather, group empathy is a strong, independent explanation for variation in attitudes toward refugees. We also find modest evidence that the positive association between empathy for refugees and support for this group is driven by partisanship, particularly for whites. The direct effect of partisanship on support for refugees is much stronger. This study contributes to research on the dynamics of race, empathy, and attitudes toward refugees.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.35","doi":"10.1017/rep.2025.35","journal_full":"Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics","dist":0.6327,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Correction to: Empire of refugees: North Caucasian Muslims and the Late Ottoman State.

That is, migrants with a higher socioeconomic status (in their prime working years, with higher household income and educational attainments) are more likely to access urban public services. Then we find that such multiple public services all have positive but different effects on migrants' settlement intention, after eliminating bias due to the selective accessibility of migrants by propensity score matching analysis.

This study highlights how ICT usage shapes migration dynamics and connectivity across geographic spaces, with implications for labor mobility and urban inclusivity. Using panel vector autoregression models, we establish a causal relationship between ICT usage and GDI, revealing heterogeneous impacts: large cities and male workers benefit more from ICT usage than small cities and female workers. While ICT-driven diversity enhances labor productivity, it also increases migrant workers’ job-hunting travel distances, contributing to higher carbon emissions.

Participants (Experiment 1: N = 1,092, Experiment 2: N = 1,809) saw an eyewitness’s lineup identification, accompanied by the eyewitness’s verbal confidence statement (e.g., “I’m pretty sure”) and either a featural (“I remember his eyes”), recognition (“I remember him”), or familiarity (“He looks familiar”) justification. They then judged the accuracy of the eyewitness’s identification. AI-assistance (vs. no assistance) improved people’s ability to distinguish between correct identifications and misidentifications, but only when they evaluated lineup identifications based on recognition or featural justifications. Discrimination of identifications based on familiarity justifications showed little improvement with AI-assistance.

In principle, reviewing aims to improve the effectiveness of regulations through economic rationality, tools, and methods. In practice, the work of oversight bodies occurs amid the politics of the rulemaking process and can be a way for the executive to control the regulatory agenda. Based on a 13‐month ethnography of Mexico's regulatory oversight body, I examine how analysts enact the technical and legal requirements of regulatory improvement while facing political tensions and interference. Using negotiated order theory, I show how analysts respond to political attention, conflict, or interference by expanding, shielding, or bending their mandate and conducting their work accordingly. Reviewing to improve regulations takes on different meanings and forms, allowing analysts to protect their work, organization, and techno‐legal mandate in the long term. The article contributes to a better understanding of regulatory review and oversight bodies.

Despite the abundant literature on social distancing, how this mode of direct state intervention, which inevitably requires a lot of regulatory resources, was implemented has been a rare source of scientific inquiry. This paper attempts to fill this gap by presenting a case study that explores how regulatory resource deficits faced by regulators implementing social distancing were addressed in the regulator‐intermediary‐target (RIT) network. This paper highlights the role of local facilities as regulatory intermediaries in implementing social distancing in South Korea. Although social distancing was purported to keep physical distance among individuals, authorities' enforcement activities were primarily, though not entirely, targeted at local facilities. Analyzing in‐depth interviews with 30 local frontline inspectors conducted in September 2021, this paper finds that local facilities played a key intermediary role in deterring the spread of COVID‐19 as a private regulator.

Initially recruited to represent their employer in court, lawyers' transformation into internal regulators can be explained by their unique position in the company and beyond. Professionally required to represent the interests of expatriate management, the lawyers, as Ethiopian nationals, routinely identified with the local workforce and counterparties. Many construed compliance as respect for Ethiopian sovereignty and popular dignity as much as adherence to the law, which explains their commitment to compliance work. By exploring the position of Ethiopian lawyers and their relative success in gently yet persuasively encouraging expatriate managers to abide by legal regulations and social norms, the article sheds light on the human face of regulation.

This study introduces the concept of uneven mixing, which captures variation in the number of intergroup ties that individuals hold in a network, as a strategy for assessing meaningful integration. A low level of uneven mixing represents more widespread intergroup ties, which is analogous to “blurred boundaries” that imply a less rigid sense of “us” versus “them.” In contrast, a high level of uneven mixing occurs when just a few individuals appear to cross over to the other side of otherwise unambiguous group boundaries. Using the case of classroom friendships, I show that native students embedded in more unevenly mixed networks are more closed off to immigrant cultures and view immigrants less favorably, even after accounting for their personal ties to immigrant classmates and the overall number of native–immigrant ties in the classroom. These patterns underscore the importance of considering the structure of intergroup ties when analyzing the relationship between networks and attitudinal integration. While this study focuses on immigrant integration, the approach used here is likely to advance knowledge on any kind of social integration that requires widespread intermixing across groups.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251336471","doi":"10.1177/00031224251336471","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.6492,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Frame Backfire: The Trouble with Civil Rights Appeals in the Contemporary United States","authors":"Fabiana Silva, Irene Bloemraad, Kim Voss","abstract":"Many scholars and activists consider civil rights to be a powerful, effective way to frame diverse causes, but do civil rights claims actually resonate? Building on social movements, collective memory, and public opinion scholarship, we conceptualize civil rights claims in three non-mutually-exclusive ways: as a highly resonant “master frame” grounded in core American ideals of equal rights, as an appeal to the idealized memory of the Civil Rights Movement, and as racialized messaging that is likely to provoke backlash. Using these conceptualizations, we derive expectations about the effectiveness of civil rights claims across diverse issues, beneficiaries, and audiences, which we test using two large-scale survey experiments. Respondents viewed “civil rights” very positively in the abstract and broadly agreed about the meaning in both closed and open-ended survey responses: civil rights are about ensuring equal rights and treatment, rather than addressing material needs. Yet, surprisingly, framing contemporary problems—even unequal treatment—as civil rights violations reduced support for government intervention. Indeed, we find widespread frame backfire : civil rights framing was counterproductive across issues (material deprivation, unequal treatment), beneficiaries (African Americans, Mexican Americans, White Americans, undocumented Mexican immigrants), and audiences (liberals, conservatives, Whites, African Americans, Latinos). Given the consistently negative effects across respondents, these findings cannot be adequately explained as racialized backlash. Instead, we propose that civil rights claims evoke comparisons to the historic Civil Rights Movement, making contemporary hardships appear less significant and prompting unfavorable contrasts with idealized claims-making of the past. Our findings challenge assumptions that frames resonate when they align with audiences’ values or appeal to positive collective memories; indeed, invoking idealized memories risks undermining support for contemporary causes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251333087","doi":"10.1177/00031224251333087","journal_full":"American Sociological Review","dist":0.531,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Correction to: How perceived daycare quality shapes norms around daycare use and parental employment: experimental evidence from Germany","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf023","doi":"10.1093/esr/jcaf023","journal_full":"European Sociological Review","dist":0.4222,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Sexual harassment across occupations: new evidence from Swedish Nationally representative data","authors":"Olle Folke, Johanna Rickne","abstract":"This paper describes sexual harassment risks from two groups of perpetrators in Swedish nationally representative survey data.

Specifically, applicants from groups facing lower callback rates must submit more applications to ensure an eventual callback, have fewer opportunities to choose from, and face higher uncertainty regarding how many applications to submit. These results reflect several sequential and cumulative stratification processes “real-world” applicants face that warrant attention in conventional audit reporting.

A major – yet surprisingly understudied – mechanism for nonviolence to work is backlash of regime repression on the regime itself, what has also been coined “political jiu-jitsu”. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to research on this repression-mobilisation nexus by investigating the effect of a campaign’s organisational structure on the likelihood of backlash, understood as increased mobilisation after repression. This study uses the NAVCO 2.0 dataset, and works with a subset of annual data on over 100 nonviolent campaigns from 1945 to 2006 with maximalist goals, i.e. regime change, anti-occupation, and secession. I argue that nonviolent campaigns with a non-hierarchical organisational structure are more likely to experience increased mobilisation after repression due to their tendency to operational resilience, internal unity, adoption of new media, favourable goals, and membership diversity. Conducting a series of logistic regression analyses, I make the findings that (1) a non-hierarchical campaign structure significantly increases the likelihood of backlash, as compared to a centralised, hierarchical campaign structure. This relation holds even when controlling for campaign size and campaign year, as well as a variety of other plausible campaign characteristics. And (2) no evidence is found for interaction effects of other campaign characteristics with non-hierarchical campaign structure in its effect on backlash. This study finds an effect previously unobserved by quantitative methods, thereby contributing to an understanding of a major mechanism of nonviolent resistance. The fruitfulness of a perspective oriented on movement characteristics, especially organisational structures, for enhancing the field’s understanding is supported.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4dcmx_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/4dcmx_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.469,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Policy Brief para prevenir la obesidad en jóvenes y adultos promoviendo la actividad física: El caso de tembici en la ciudad de Bogotá trayendo las experiencias de Lima y Monterrey","authors":"Catalina Arbelaez Hoyos, Antonia Perilla Orduz, Francisco Palencia-Sánchez, Ana Paola Islas Castillo, Diego Alesis Lara Miranda, Romina Villarreal Pérez, Andrea Cantú Rodríguez","abstract":"La obesidad y el sobrepeso son problemáticas de salud pública que vienen en aumento en años recientes a nivel mundial.

In the same way that public officials stand to lead constructive online dialogue, they also hold the potential to accelerate the dissemination of low-factual and harmful content. This study aims to explore and explain the sharing of low-factual content by examining nearly 500,000 Facebook posts by U.S. state legislators from 2020 to 2021. We validate a widely used low-factual content detection approach in misinformation studies, and apply the measure to all of the posts we collect. Our findings reveal that the prevalence is relatively rare, affecting less than one percent of legislators' posts overall. However, Republican legislators share low-factual content at higher rates, and certain states emerge as hotspots for such content. We also find that conservative lawmakers are more likely to share such content, with this tendency potentially intensifying in conservative districts, and waning in liberal ones. Most importantly, legislative professionalism acts as a systemic constraint: lawmakers in professionalized legislatures are less likely to share low-factual content, suggesting that high professional standards curb the spread of misinformation. We conclude with a discussion of how our results present implications for future interventions to reduce the spread of low-factual content.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c9qea_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/c9qea_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4393,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Good Description","authors":"Daniel de Kadt, Anna Grzymala-Busse","abstract":"What distinguishes 'good' description from 'mere' description?

Reidpath","abstract":"The global human rights framework is failing—not from irrelevance, but from a lack of foundational coherence. Despite formal commitments, rights are routinely violated, fragmented by political will and conceptual fragility. Nowhere is this disjunction more evident than in global health and development, where institutional rhetoric masks systemic inertia. This paper argues that human rights lack a principled foundation, rendering them vulnerable to political manipulation, relativist erosion, and functional collapse. In response, it proposes an axiomatic approach, identifying three irreducible moral commitments—dignity, welfare, and non-expendability—as necessary and jointly sufficient to re-ground the framework. These axioms resist coercive power, protect against majoritarianism, and constrain cultural relativism, offering a structure capable of sustaining universality without imposing uniformity. Rather than relying on abstract theories or cultural consensus, this model works backward—asking what is minimally required for rights to function meaningfully across domains. The axioms clarify contested issues (e.g., abortion) and evaluate institutional legitimacy through a moral lens. They do not resolve all conflicts but render them intelligible and accountable. In a world where the international order is faltering and states increasingly reject moral constraint, these axioms offer a stable foundation for human rights to endure—even, and especially, when institutions fail.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h32p7_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/h32p7_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4302,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Improving Use of SMART Goals in Science Diplomacy: An Overview of Concepts and Approaches","authors":"Lee Voth-Gaeddert","abstract":"The SMART goal approach (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound) can provide a robust tool within the complex field of science diplomacy.

The motives for targeted violence against health care are often diverse. Research on the topic is challenging since perpetrators are usually unable or unwilling to participate in the research. This study investigates the perpetrators' possible motives through healthcare workers' experiences and views. To protect health care in contemporary modern complex conflicts, it is essential to understand the motives of perpetrators of violence. This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews (n = 25) with professionals who have worked in Syria between 2011 and 2017. Participants were selected using a snowball sampling method and interviewed in Turkey and Europe between 2016 and 2017. The analysis was performed using content analysis. Our results indicate that the violence conducted by GoS may aim to suppress all forms of dissent and critical voices, regardless of profession, underlining the political nature of the regime's actions. NSAGs, instead, seemed to perceive healthcare workers as valuable assets to exploit. ISIS's attitude towards HCWs was predominantly political-ideological, fostering deep suspicion and intent on punishing those participating in resistance. Both GoS and ISIS were seen to use violence against health care as part of a broader pattern targeting civilians.

We argue that the effect of violence is asymmetric and predominantly benefits nationalist, radical-right parties. Posing as defenders of the nation, nationalist parties benefit from violence by their political opponents and violence targeted against perceived threats to the nation. Two potential mechanisms underlie this asymmetric effect. First, nationalist violence becomes an acceptable means of defense in the eyes of status quo-oriented voters if they attribute blame to out-groups who used violence first. Second, nationalist violence itself increases the salience of a threat to the nation, and voters concerned with preserving the status quo see radical right parties as its most effective defender. To test this argument, we collect novel actor-based and geospatial data of political violence in interwar Italy. Using a difference-in-differences estimator, we model the effect of violence on vote shares of anti-system parties at the municipality-level in the 1919 and 1921 elections. Our results indicate increasing electoral support for the nationalist Fascist party in municipalities that experienced violence committed by either the far right or left after the 1919 election. In contrast, the radical left Socialist party loses electoral support if violence occurs. These results are robust to different specifications, modeling choices, and measurement approaches. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our findings for violence in liberal democracies today.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w8y96_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/w8y96_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5426,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Asymmetric Alliances in Climate Misinformation: A Network Analysis of the Swedish Climate Change Countermovement","authors":"Anton Törnberg, Victoria Vallström","abstract":"Climate change countermovements play a key role in spreading misinformation and delaying policy action.

The alliances between these ideological groupings are not reciprocal: while climate skeptic sites receive numerous links from other groups, they predominantly link to scientific sources and international sites. The presence of this asymmetric alliance indicates that climate skeptic sites act as central hubs, channeling international CCCM discourses into Sweden, influencing and strategically aligning with various local ideological communities.

These frameworks hold significant implications both for our understanding of cultural polarization, and our real-world strategies to address it. To help adjudicate between these two perspectives we examine a contemporary conservative social movement: book bans in public schools and libraries. Using vignette experiments that manipulate the social characteristics of the main characters in existing novels, our findings support the consolidation model of cultural polarization. Although Americans are inclined to judge the appropriateness of books based on the social identities of their main characters, they still generally consider stories about outgroups and rivals to be appropriate for public schools and libraries. Ideological effects are significantly attenuated by sociodemographic, psychometric, and sociometric factors that have been consolidated into parties. This suggests that even at the height of a “take-off” issue replete with consistent cueing by partisan elites and targeted campaigns by activists, popular culture remains a resource for polarized partisans, rather than a creator of them.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zpe8y_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/zpe8y_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5514,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Impact of Austerity on Mortality and Life Expectancy","authors":"Yonatan Berman, Tora Hovland, Carolyn Fisher","abstract":"This paper studies the impact of austerity measures implemented by the UK government after 2010 on life expectancy and mortality.

Second, instead of blunt tariffs, IP is granular and technocratic. Countries tend to use subsidies and export promotion measures, often targeted at individual firms. Third, the countries engaged most in IP tend to be wealthier (top income quintile) liberal democracies. In our data, IP is rarer among the poorest nations (bottom quintile). Fourth, IP is targeted toward a subset of industries and is highly correlated with an industry’s revealed comparative advantage.

Results show that exposure is linked to reduced preference for co-ethnic Japanese candidates, consistent with the deprovincialization hypothesis. However, openness to foreign candidates varies by nationality. Contact is associated with increased acceptance of some groups, but not others and in some cases even reinforces negative views.

This study investigates the internal mobility preferences of Syrian refugees in Turkey and Germany. Adopting a multi-method approach, we conducted a choice-based conjoint experiment with over 3,000 participants and a content analysis of qualitative survey data. The results of the experimental survey reveal that local attitudes and policies are more significant in shaping refugees’ destination preferences than economic factors and social ties. Additionally, the results of the content analysis demonstrate that Syrian refugees associate anti-immigrant local policies and attitudes primarily with exclusion, social isolation, discrimination, and heightened anxiety. Many refugees fear that such conditions and experiences may prevent them from developing a strong sense of belonging, leading them to avoid localities with restrictive policies and hostile attitudes. Our findings also demonstrate a strong deterrent effect of anti-immigration policies and discourses. From both normative and policy perspectives, we conclude that inclusive local policies and attitudes are essential for promoting refugees’ integration and psychosocial well-being.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mjgzh_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/mjgzh_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.7179,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Environmental Fallout of India's Protracted Conflicts","authors":"Dr. Soshina Nathan","abstract":"Wars are often measured by the number of lives lost and political change, but the damage they cause to our environment; land, water, air, and wildlife, are equally severe. While the environmental impacts of wars or armed conflicts have been widely studied, the effects of low-intensity and protracted social and political conflicts have not received as much attention, despite their far-reaching and often overlooked ecological consequences. India’s landscapes have been profoundly shaped by centuries of environmental change, much of which stem from a history of colonial exploitation and subsequent conflict and resistance. This paper presents a chronological analysis of the ecological consequences of low-intensity and protracted conflicts in India, beginning with the environmental legacy of British colonialism. The colonial era brought about extensive deforestation, the expansion of monoculture plantations, and the arrival of invasive species; changes all propelled by the British Empire’s economic goals and strategic ambitions. These shifts disrupted traditional land use practices, displaced indigenous communities, and laid the groundwork for many of the ecological crises India faces today. In the postcolonial period, the environmental landscape continued to be shaped by new forms of disruption: militarization in the Himalayas, armed insurgencies in regions like the Red Corridor and the North East, and growing resistance movements led by Adivasi communities in places such as Jharkhand and Kerala. Each of these phases has left lasting ecological footprints, from the breaking up of habitats and species loss, to the erosion of long-standing systems of environmental stewardship. These developments reveal how deeply today’s environmental challenges are rooted in India’s colonial legacy and the enduring struggles of its marginalized communities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ng9wv_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ng9wv_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3501,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Living on buffered time: Toward another sociology of storage","authors":"Veit Braun","abstract":"This article seeks to understand the role of storage for social time. While social theory has largely interpreted storage in spatial terms, a recent body of literature explores how cold storage technologies affect society’s relationship with time. The ability to suspend life in ice, several scholars argue, leads to a new relationship with time: the future becomes malleable as frozen cells, tissues and seeds are options with which events can be reversed, action can be postponed, and the status quo can be preserved. However, a growing number of empirical studies of cold storage complicates this hypothesis, finding that these technologies are often used to accelerate action instead. The divergence, this article argues, can be understood by linking the assumptions underlying the suspension hypothesis to sociological concepts like value, expectations, and especially practice. It argues that under certain circumstances, storage is best understood as dynamic rather than static. Taking in things and releasing them at different rates, it acts as a form of buffer that can link social activity and flows of different speeds and rhythms without imposing a shared temporality on them. On these grounds, the article pleads for a broadened understanding of storage as a social technique that affects both space and time.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ua8bn_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ua8bn_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3791,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Education Reimagined in the Age of AI: Why We Learn and the Meaning of Human Labor","authors":"Erica Hu","abstract":"Since ancient times, humanity's relentless pursuit of knowledge has been a defining attribute of our species. As AI capabilities rapidly accelerate, the relationship between human learning and machine intelligence has reached an inflection point. Our antiquated education systems now stand at a crossroads, where technology offers potential to redefine the fundamental nature of learning. This dissertation argues that the rise of AI necessitates a reimagining of education, shifting away from rote knowledge acquisition to instead creativity, emotional intelligence, and lifelong curiosity—the qualities that make us intrinsically human. Human labor faces its own AI-induced metamorphosis. As algorithms automate tasks and enhance productivity, we must reexamine the deeper meaning and value of work in a society increasingly permeated by intelligent machines. What becomes of the dignity, satisfaction, and sense of purpose humans have long derived from their labors? This dissertation will investigate the social, economic, and philosophical implications of an AI-transformed labor market through an interdisciplinary lens spanning fields from anthropology and cognitive science to economics. This study contends that rather than training workers for specific skills, the schools of the future should prioritize nurturing self-directed learning and engaged citizens who can thrive in a workplace shared with AI. If education is reoriented toward cultivating humanity's unique aptitudes, we can build a future where both human and machine intelligence reach their full potential in collaboration. This outlook provides a compass to guide education leaders in adapting to an automated, AI-driven world where the meanings of learning and labor continue to evolve.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/27naq_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/27naq_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4033,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Conflicts and Agricultural Reconstruction: Challenges Faced by Formerly Displaced Farmers under Victor’s Peace -Case of Sri Lanka","authors":"Sho Yamada, Minakshi Keeni, Katsuhito Fuyuki","abstract":"Since the Second World War, conflicts in developing countries have led to the displacement of rural residents. In Sri Lanka, an internal conflict between 1989 and 2009 displaced many rural residents. Muthur residents were forced to evacuate in 2006 and returned in 2014 on average after prolonged displacement. In this study, we aim to identify the constraints on agriculture in post-conflict settings and the roles of governments and aid donors in enhancing the recovery of their livelihoods. Through semi-structured interviews with Muthur farmers, we found conflict-induced constraints, such as deterioration in human capital, destruction of storage facilities, confusion of land ownership, constrained paddy cultivation, along with other agricultural constraints. Addressing land ownership issues and providing financial compensation are crucial for enhancing livelihood recovery in such cases. However, in intrastate conflicts, the role of the government in leading reconstruction is problematic. If land ownership issues are not resolved, development projects can harm their livelihoods.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3zcwu_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/3zcwu_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.411,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Great Sysop: Elon Musk, X, and the Emergence of Platform Illiberalism","authors":"João C.

Together, these processes resulted in what we conceptualize as platform illiberalism, an emerging regime whereby illiberal-esque logics reshape speech control internally while supporting illiberal actors externally. We argue that X represents an unprecedented fusion of social media and authoritarianism, with close ties to and potential implications for democratic erosion in the US and beyond.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6grbc_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/6grbc_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4117,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"How Public Administrators Empower Themselves","authors":"David S.

However, its institutionalization in the mid-20th century contrasts sharply with the 300-year history of academic journals. By the early 21st century, there emerged an opinion that the conventional model of peer review faces systematic challenges, including inefficiency, bias, and institutional inertia. The study aims to synthesize the evolution, practices, and outcomes of both conventional and innovative peer review models in scholarly publishing. Through a mixed-methods approach combining interpretative literature review and process modeling (BPMN), it identifies four frameworks: pre-publication peer review, registered reports, modular publishing, and the Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) model. While the PRC model, which integrates preprints with post-publication review, demonstrates advantages in transparency and accessibility, no single approach emerges as universally ideal. The choice of model depends on disciplinary context, resource availability, and institutional priorities. The analysis underscores the need for adaptable platforms that enable hybrid workflows, balancing rigor with inclusivity. Future research must address empirical gaps in evaluating these innovations, particularly their long-term impact on equity and epistemic norms.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2ra3_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/b2ra3_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3794,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Comparing methods for determining home and work locations from geotagged social media data","authors":"Robert Goodspeed, Meixin Yuan, Ashley Nicole-Beals Bhogal, VG Vinod Vydiswaran, Daniel Romero, Matthew Willis, Tiffany Veinot","abstract":"Geotagged social media data have emerged as a rich source of insight about spatial dimensions of social phenomena.

We argue that the poor can hold governments accountable through critical peer discourse, which refers to the exchange of critical views within communities about public policy. While critical peer discourse often generates a passive political space with limited influence on government politics, it can become a space of governmental accountability when customized around SDG1 and SDG2 indicators.

This study introduces a novel generative AI (GenAI) platform, trained with a new Culturally Competent Communication (CCC) Guide, that can offer additional learning opportunities for students. Methods. The AI platform can simulate consultations and give students structured feedback based on the CCC Guide. A qualitative survey was used to capture fifteen third-year medical students’ experience learning with the AI platform, which was then thematically analysed. Results. The results show that the feedback based on the CCC Guide was effective in developing students’ culturally competent communication strategies. The CCC Guide offers a practical framework for clinical practice and educational interventions. The AI platform provides students with a safe and flexible space for practice. It can allow students and teachers to track and personalise learning. Discussion. This innovative approach provides another solution to the evolving trend in medical education, which is moving away from high-stakes summative assessments toward more continuous formative evaluations and blended learning strategies. The findings also pose a critical argument that GenAI tools should serve as complementary to, rather than a replacement for, human-led training.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ywv7z_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ywv7z_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3757,"specialized":false,"preprint":true}]
