[{"title": "Citizenship Renunciation without Emigration", "authors": "LIOR EREZ", "abstract": "Against the status quo, this article argues for the right to renounce state citizenship while remaining a resident. To motivate this argument, it presents a dilemma: if long-term residents can choose not to naturalize, why cannot citizens renounce their status without leaving? This article rejects one way out of this dilemma—making citizenship mandatory for long-term residents—and proceeds to make the positive case for the right to renounce citizenship. It argues for the value of citizenship renunciation as an expressive political act, distinct from territorial exit, which allows individuals to sever political ties while maintaining social membership. This form of political exit enables citizens to express their detachment from the state without the costs of emigration. This article explores the implications of this proposal for democratic consent, legitimate authority, and collective citizen responsibility for state action, arguing that a right to renounce without emigration enhances autonomy and democratic legitimacy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101020", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101020", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.7907647994126578}, {"title": "Performative Violence and the Spectacular Debut of the Atomic Bomb", "authors": "JOSHUA BYUN, AUSTIN CARSON", "abstract": "The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki reshaped international politics and the field of International Relations.

One key approach is democratizing legislative candidate selection to grant party members or voters greater influence and signal improved responsiveness, transparency, and legitimacy.

We argue that more inclusive candidate selection does not have meaningful effects at the polls despite its merits.

I argue that judicial checks on the government shape citizens’ attitudes about judicial institutions at large, but these effects are driven by instrumental considerations, namely partisanship. In particular, my account suggests that judicial checks – as specific instances of interbranch conflict – provide citizens with instrumental information that shapes their beliefs about the broader judiciary. Thus, I hypothesize that court rulings limiting the government’s power will undermine support for the judiciary among individuals aligned with the incumbent, but increase support among opposition sympathizers. I test these expectations by exploiting the timing of two judicial decisions in Argentina (enacted by a lower court and the Supreme Court) that invalidated a highly salient judicial reform promoted by the government in 2013. Using data from a survey fielded before and after the court rulings, I show that the decisions significantly decreased government supporters’ trust in the judiciary, while opposition supporters increased their trust only following the Supreme Court ruling.

The use of what we term ‘authoritarian nostalgia’ is not only becoming more widespread across politics but it has proven effective across diverse segments of the electorate. This study examines the extent to which (populist radical) right supporters approve of their countries’ authoritarian histories and view these past regimes favourably. Using original survey data fielded in Spain and Portugal and a novel set of survey items measuring authoritarian nostalgia, we find that supporters of VOX and Chega are more likely to express a broad sense of collective nostalgia, particularly through a longing for their country’s ‘old, glorious days’, but demonstrate strong nostalgia for Franco and Salazar’s authoritarian regimes more specifically. Furthermore, we observe similar affinities for the authoritarian past amongst traditional right-wing supporters, primarily among Partido Popular (PP) supporters in Spain, with weaker evidence for PPD/PSD supporters in Portugal.

This is largely due to opposition from fossil fuel producers and heavy industrial sectors that are existentially threatened by decarbonisation. The rise of green industrial policy promises to advance climate policy by reducing this opposition and mobilising corporate supporters. But can climate policy strategies actually shift the balance of interest group mobilisation among expected winners and losers simply by using different policy instruments? I theorise that policy strategies (de)mobilise corporate interests through regulatory targeting. Corporations directly targeted by a proposed policy are more likely to lobby because of policy-specific informational advantages and more certain and immediate impacts. Compared to traditional climate policies that impose direct costs on fossil fuels, green industrial policies should therefore demobilise high-carbon firms and mobilise their low-carbon counterparts. I collect and code novel data on all corporate responses to online consultations in European Union climate and energy policy from 2017 to 2022. Dyadic regression analyses confirm that low-carbon sectors lobby mostly on green industrial policies while high-carbon sectors mobilise more around traditional climate policies, and that stakeholders are more likely to lobby when directly targeted by policies.

While most of this literature has focused on human rights framing by NGOs and advocates, governments can also frame human rights interests to their advantage. Focusing on the topic of police violence in the United States government’s transnational human rights advocacy practices, this article argues that a government may frame advocacy narratives for its benefit. For the government, strategic framing could be used to mobilize pressure against its geopolitical rivals, ease condemnation against its friends, and actively define advocated issues in a way favorable to its regime. With a novel network approach for text representation based on pre-trained large language models (LLMs), this article proposes an effective method to measure strategic framing from text data. Using the US State Department’s human rights reports, the results show that police violence accusations in the US government’s human rights advocacy narratives are strategically framed with reporting in favor of countries closer to the US. This research contributes to human rights scholarship by highlighting how governments’ national interests considerations could be incorporated into transnational human rights advocacy activities through strategic framing. The proposed LLM-based text data representation method also shows promising potential for broader text analysis tasks like topic modeling.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251360205", "doi": "10.1177/00223433251360205", "journal_full": "Journal of Peace Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.020817728735282426}, {"title": "Hit where it hurts: City vulnerability during wartime", "authors": "Bryce W Reeder, Gary Uzonyi", "abstract": "Success in center-seeking rebellions requires rebels to oust the incumbent government.

We build from existing literature to integrate theories of rebel strength with a broader understanding of both the strategic and symbolic value of territory. Building a new dataset of location value and employing novel empirical techniques, we demonstrate that as a location’s value increases relative to the capital city for a group, the rebels become less likely to move against the capital as they can build offensive strength, fortify their defensive position, and appease local constituents in their current geographic domain. Relative strength conditions these strategies, as stronger groups tend to take a more straight-line approach to the capital, middling groups advance in zigzag patterns, and the weakest groups move in spiral formations to maximize their defensive and symbolic positions. We find that these patterns hold across a wide range of population thresholds. Several case studies help illustrate the mechanisms central to these dynamics.

I point to two analytical blind spots in research on progressive politics: (1) the separation of sociocultural from economic issues, which can conceal critical policy preferences within the knowledge economy class, and (2) the prevailing dichotomy of knowledge economy “winners” and “losers,” which can lead scholars to underestimate status concerns in the knowledge economy class. To illustrate why addressing both blind spots matters for research on electoral outcomes and progressive policy agendas, I apply my claims to the issue of immigration. I show how the interaction of sociocultural progress and economic change—manifesting in this case as status gains among ethnoracial minorities—can underpin a politics of status preservation among “winners” that calls for as much attention as that dedicated to the politics of status loss among “losers.” Using cross-national survey data, I show that members of the knowledge economy class adopt a politics of status preservation in contexts in which ethnoracial minorities, although not on a par with advantaged white majorities, are better represented in high-status positions.

In line with theoretical expectations regarding human behavior, our results suggest an increase in negative media bias: a 0.5 °C (0.9 °F) increment in daily maximum temperature on a hot day (&gt; 25 °C or &gt; 77 °F) leads to about a 10% increase in the negative bias measured as the difference in the share of negative news about the Republicans and the Democrats. This effect is mainly driven by an increase of the share of negative news about the Republicans. This bias in political reporting exists only for maximum temperatures, as opposed to minimum or average temperatures.

This article demonstrates that financial globalization transforms party positions in one important policy area: the degree of exchange rate overvaluation or undervaluation. At low levels of capital mobility, left-wing parties are more likely to overvalue the exchange rate than are right-wing parties because doing so redistributes income from capital to labor. As capital mobility rises, overvalued exchange rates become costlier for workers but more attractive to firms.

An empirical analysis of twenty-five years of wto Appellate Body (ab) activity offers a nuanced answer. Exploiting the random allocation of adjudicators to ab divisions, the authors find no evidence of systematic national bias across the board. Yet evidence does exist of bias on the part of ab division chairs, suggesting that when adjudicators are singled out, they become more prone to political pressure. A similar effect pertains to individual dissenting opinions. The presence of a conational from a litigant country on an ab division is associated with significantly increased odds of dissent.

Specifically, a cognitive-structural approach to message design would suggest that messages targeting central concepts in an audience’s shared cognitive structure will have stronger persuasive effects than messages targeting more peripheral concepts. The present investigation, however, failed to provide support for this approach. The results of four studies revealed that attitude and semantic networks each provided a different estimate of cognitive structure and made competing claims about whether this structure differs for Republicans and Democrats.

The article proposes a conceptual framework for analyzing rural communication through an analysis of the activities of Radio Dhimsa, a community radio broadcaster in Eastern India. It critiques the tendency to treat ‘rural’ as a passive backdrop, advocating for a deeper understanding of the interplay between media, place, and rurality. By analyzing the cultural, administrative, and material dimensions of CR, the study highlights its multifaceted impact on content production and dissemination. Drawing on ethnographic and qualitative methods, including participant observation, interviews, and focus group discussions, and employing constructive interpretive grounded theory, the findings reveal Radio Dhimsa’s critical role in cultural preservation, local empowerment, and amplifying marginalized voices. Broadcasting in the Desia (Indigenous) dialect, the station fosters belonging and counters socio-political marginalization while navigating the challenges posed by physical geography and climatic conditions.

By employing ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, Critical Discourse Analysis, and Framing Theory, this research explores a multilayered model of mediation that merges the strategic coordination of programmed campaigns with the emotional authenticity of grassroots spontaneity. Through the strategic exploitation of Facebook’s algorithmic architecture, emotionally resonant content was widely disseminated, creating echo chambers that reinforced ingroup loyalty while excluding dissent. Religious framing was central to these efforts, positioning Bolsonaro as a divinely ordained leader whose political struggles integrated a larger spiritual mission. Actor 1 emerges as a paradigmatic intermediary, whose communicative practices integrate opinion leadership, moral-political curation, religious framing, and strategic activism. Religion plays an important role, positioning Bolsonaro as a divinely ordained leader whose political struggles were embedded in a broader spiritual mission. The study demonstrates how technopolitical strategies, intertwined with religious discourse, were used to adapt to regulatory pressures by casting institutional supervision as censorship. These practices shaped collective identities, sustained ideological cohesion, and rallied supporters within a polarized sociopolitical context.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251385466", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251385466", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01925115731585214}, {"title": "Towards the Comparative Study of Domestic Influence Operations: Cyber Troops and Elite Competition in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand", "authors": "K.

What were its long-term effects? We digitize a great deal of historical data from the mid-1500s onwards, impute prehispanic populations at municipal level, and reconstruct the Spanish conquerors’ route through Colombia using detailed topographical features to calculate their least-cost path. We show that Colombian municipalities with encomiendas in 1560 enjoy better outcomes today across multiple dimensions of development than those without: higher municipal GDP per capita, tax receipts, and educational attainment; lower infant mortality, poverty, and unsatisfied basic needs; larger populations; and superior fiscal performance and bureaucratic efficiency, but also higher inequality. Why? Mediation analysis using data on local institutions, populations and racial composition in 1794 shows that encomiendas affected development primarily by helping build the local state. Deep historical evidence fleshes out how encomenderos founded local institutions early on in the places they settled. Places lacking encomiendas also lacked local states, often for centuries. Local institutions mobilized public investment in ways that doubtless suited encomenderos, but, over time, spurred greater economic and human development.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf108", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueaf108", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.10828354374251092}, {"title": "Being Young in Spain and the Scars from Recessions", "authors": "Andrés Erosa, Ismael Gálvez-Iniesta, Matthias Kredler", "abstract": "Evidence from Spanish administrative data suggests that the Great Recession had long-lasting effects on employment and wages, with heterogeneous impacts across different groups of male workers. To assess the long-run effects of recessions on males’ careers, we develop a statistical model of cyclical fluctuations in the labour market. In the model, young workers are more likely to be employed in temporary jobs than older workers, increasing their likelihood of facing a job separation when a recession hits. Low job-finding rates during recessions imply that displaced workers will likely face a long period of unemployment and lower skill accumulation, feeding into worse future labour-market outcomes. Our results indicate that individuals with less than a high school education entering the economy at the start of the Great Recession suffered the highest lifetime earnings losses of about 12 percent. High school and college graduates experienced losses of about 9 and 8 percent.

The boll weevil, one of the most destructive agricultural pests in American history, decreased cotton production and resulted in substantial changes to the Southern economy. The impact of this shock on children who were born before and after its arrival is not a priori obvious; it could be positive or negative depending on whether children born after the shock experienced better or worse early life conditions. To examine the empirical effects of this shock on Black and White fathers and sons, the analysis makes use of cross-census links from the Census Tree (Buckles et al., 2023) and race-specific difference-in-differences and triple difference empirical strategies. We find the arrival of the boll weevil benefited Black sons in the long run, as reflected in two 1940 measures of income – wages and imputed income – and did not harm White sons. These differential gains decreased inequality. We provide empirical and historical evidence on a range of mechanisms through which early life conditions may have improved for Black sons relative to White sons.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf110", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueaf110", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014785697617530902}, {"title": "Dynamic Choices with Social Interactions", "authors": "Tiziano Arduini, Alberto Bisin, Onur Ozgur, Eleonora Patacchini", "abstract": "We introduce the study of dynamic, forward-looking equilibrium choices in environments characterized by social interactions.

We then derive conditions for the identification of the parameters of the dynamic social interaction model with panel data. We finally illustrate the empirical implications of the model by bringing it to data in the context of adolescents’ smoking behaviour, where addiction effects are arguably a first-order concern.

For the typical year in our period, the annual return to owning housing was 9%, driven mostly by rental returns of 7.7%, with capital gains contributing only 1.3%.

This note seeks to uncover patterns in recent Presidential elections that display a lack of effectiveness of prominent voter turnout models for Black Americans due to disparate socializing experiences in a post-Obama context like voter suppression and a global pandemic. It employs models previously used by Leighley and Vedlitz (1999) to evaluate and compare turnout models for Black and White individuals with mini-meta analysis. This paper utilizes the 2016 and 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-election Survey (CMPS) and the 2016 and 2020 American National Election Study to establish models and measure their impact on Black and White voter turnout. I find support that prominent turnout models behave differently in a post-Obama context like income, length of residence, group consciousness, and group threat while some models behave differently for Black and white voters like political interest and political efficacy. These findings assert that new turnout models need to be established to better understand the Black electorate in a post-Obama context.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10027", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10027", "journal_full": "Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012118265152514018}, {"title": "Recentring Intimacy in Hopping (Im)mobilities of Academic Precarity", "authors": "Ieva Puzo, Aija Lulle", "abstract": "This article introduces the notion of ‘hopping (im)mobilities’, referring to relatively short‐term relocations—socially and geographically—within neoliberal academia.

Two questions are examined: First, does international experience pay off in terms of labour market success? Second, does remigrants' labour market success depend on other social factors? To answer these questions, German remigrants and the German stayer population are compared regarding wages, occupational status and unemployment risk. Thus, not only employment conditions are analysed, but also labour market participation. Based on data from the German Emigration and Remigration Panel Study (GERPS) and German Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP), regressions are estimated. Results indicate that compared to stayers, German remigrants generally benefit in terms of wages and partly in terms of occupational status.

Only 11% of respondents reported having no migration potential, while those with the highest migration capabilities ‐ including both returnees and non‐migrants ‐ were often undecided about their future mobility.

The findings indicate that the RECSP improves regional employment rates and population inflows, with enhanced environmental quality, refinement of public services, manufacturing shifts, and industrial upgrades being the primary mechanisms. Notably, the effects of RECSP on population settlement are more pronounced in regions with centralized heating and in the Northeast. Furthermore, mining cities witnessed a more substantial surge in employment rate, while forestry‐based cities registered a marked population inflow.

However, as the economy transitions toward tertiary industry dominance, population regulations in many mega‐cities exhibit a preference for high‐skilled labourers while constraining the inflow of low‐skilled ones. Using panel data from 288 Chinese cities, this study examines the changes of human capital's divergence and how population regulations and industrial development influence the changes. We present new spatial evidence that sheds light on the reverse changes in the divergence of human capital from 2008 to 2019, which initially decreased and then increased. When population regulations align with the demands of industrial development, they help reduce the divergence in human capital. Conversely, misalignment exacerbates undesired divergence, which fails to meet the regulatory objectives for high‐ and low‐skilled labourers and fails to satisfy the labour demands of industrial development.

Based on a university graduate survey conducted in 2022, this study examines the influence of multidimensional distance on the destination choices of graduate migrants, which comprises of geographical distance, administrative distance, cultural distance, informational distance and industrial distance, taking into account the dual reference points of both the hometown and the city of the university. The research findings suggest that, for university graduates who migrate to destinations distinct from both their home city and university city, the distance with the home city plays a more important role than the distance with the city of university, in determining their destination choices. Thereinto, the geographical distance, administrative distance and informational distance with hometown have a stronger influence on the destination choices of graduates, while the cultural distance with the city of university matters more in affecting their migration decisions. The industrial distance with the destination city, nevertheless, has a dual character: the complementarity of industry structure to the city of university increases the in‐migration of graduates, while the similarity of industry structure to the hometown encourages the in‐migration of graduates. In addition, the impacts of multidimensional distances on destination choices of graduates vary with their degree levels, hukou status and self‐assessed risk attitude.

Identifying Long‐Term Internal Migration Trajectories of Rural Young Adults in the Netherlands", "authors": "Tineke Reitsma, Femke D. Cnossen, Tialda Haartsen, Bettina B. Bock", "abstract": "To counteract the effects of young adult out‐migration, rural areas are increasingly interested in whether leavers return, and when and why they do so. However, little is known about their migration trajectories after departure. Their out‐migration is often studied as a one‐time event, even though it marks the start of a dynamic life phase with numerous events that potentially lead to residential relocations. To capture long‐term migration trajectories, we provide a more nuanced picture of rural young adult migration by following their residential trajectories from age 17 to 35, using longitudinal register data from Statistics Netherlands. We reveal five common migration patterns after leaving: (1) return migrants, (2) repeat leavers, (3) late leavers, (4) onward migrants, (5) one‐time migrants, alongside a group of non‐migrants: (6) stayers. Partnering with someone from the same area of origin increases the likelihood of return, whereas having a partner from elsewhere is linked to continued migration. Men are more likely to be late leavers or stayers; (applied) university graduates are more likely to have more mobile trajectories; and parenthood raises the likelihood of return migration, repeat leaving, or late leaving, while lowering the likelihood of one‐time migration. Our focus on long‐term trajectories reveals that over half of rural young adult leavers have returned to the rural by age 35. This shows that by and large not all out‐migrants leave the rural for good and suggests that return migrants are a valuable group to target when addressing rural youth out‐migration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70130", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70130", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9790362887202132}, {"title": "Reexamining the Impact of Locations on Leaving the Parental Home and Choosing New Locations: Evidence From a New Joint Choice Model", "authors": "Yusi Luo, Ling Li, Ying Jin", "abstract": "Previous models for leaving the parental home mainly focus on the influence of local factors while overlooking how opportunities and costs associated with living outside the local area influence the decision to leave.

This model accounts for young people's trade‐offs between various location factors in both their parents’ residences and different alternative destinations based on their Socioeconomic circumstances and family backgrounds. Using data from the Understanding Society, we employ an approximate estimation techinique to estimate this model with sampling of alternatives. The results confirm the effectiveness of the model in quantifying the decision‐making process and align closely with migration theory. Specifically, job opportunities in nonlocal areas encourage both graduates and non‐graduates to leave home and migrate there, while housing costs pose a barrier for non‐graduates but not for graduates.

In this study, we analyzed 250,000 d of smartphone usage data from 10,099 adults, using objective measures of smartphone usage collected over 4 wk. We examined normative usage patterns and the temporal relationships between smartphone use and mood. Our findings reveal weak or null associations between smartphone use and mood, both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and at both individual and group levels. Demographic factors, such as age and gender, were stronger predictors of mood than smartphone use. Statistically significant results that were observed showed that younger adults demonstrated a stronger association between social media use and lower mood cross-sectionally, but not longitudinally. Non-social app use was linked to lower mood in between-subjects analyses, but better mood in within-subjects analyses. However, all effects were small (or null), indicating minimal practical significance.

Accordingly, judgment errors arise from biased sampling of information from graphs. We tested our theory in four eye-tracking experiments (total N = 421), in which participants made correlation judgments from scatterplots of both experimentally manipulated data (Experiment 1) and real data (Experiment 2), as well as plots with different display formats (Experiments 3 and 4). Participants’ judgments displayed several known biases, including underestimation of absolute correlations and sensitivity to irrelevant visual features. Importantly, the (optimal) Bayesian belief updating model, trained on the sensory inputs from visual information search, predicted both participants’ judgments and associated biases with high accuracy in all the experiments. Additionally, a computational model of participants’ information sampling processes, combined with the Bayesian model, reproduced all behavioral regularities.

Further, we found task-related measures, like overall friend requests, were correlated with mental health dimensions like social thriving and anhedonia. Next, in an ultra-high-field fMRI study (n = 24), we found that both fundamental features of social environments--opportunity density and frequency of success--affected neural activity across a network of regions linked to foraging including dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and anterior insula. Thus, humans consider the background statistics of an environment while making social decisions and these decisions are linked to activity in cortico-subcortical circuits mediating the influence of environmental statistics on other aspects of behavior.

These estimates, however, are essential for monitoring gaps within countries and implementing targeted interventions within the global sustainable development goals, which emphasize the need to close inequalities both between and within countries. We develop estimates of internet and mobile adoption by gender and digital gender gaps at the subnational level for 2,075 regions in 117 LMICs from 2015 through 2025, a context where digital penetration is low and national-level gender gaps disfavoring women are large.

The MTPA framework also allowed us to reverse-engineer specific thematic properties of the stimulus that evoked differential neural responses linked to these predicted outcomes.

Synthetic tropical cyclones were generated using data from seven global climate models (GCMs), used to compare power outage risks at the census tract level along two periods: hindcast (1995–2014) and late-century (2071–2100) using the SSP5-8.5 scenario.

Results highlight a significant increase in power outage risks and high agreement in northern Florida, Georgia, the mid-Atlantic, and the North Atlantic coast. Distributional impact analyses indicate higher outage risks for Hispanic, non-White, and low-income populations, while economic projections show annual costs rising from $6.2 billion in the hindcast to over $11 billion for the 3 °C scenario.

This paper contributes to the current literature by investigating how the relationship between digitalization and the government's capacity to tax is influenced by governmental responsiveness and capabilities, an element largely disregarded in prior analyses. Empirical results from a time‐series cross‐sectional dataset that includes up to 159 countries spanning from 2004 to 2021 demonstrate that a high level of digitalization does not automatically result in an increased non‐resource tax revenue‐to‐GDP ratio.

Specifically, we examine whether and to what extent a more representative government workforce influences immigrant families' participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and moderates the impact of unfavorable immigrant policy climates. Analyzing data on 49 states from 2006 to 2016, we find that a government workforce with higher Hispanic and Asian representation within the public welfare area is associated with increased SNAP participation among U.S.‐born children with immigrant parents. This link is contingent on states' immigrant policy climates. Higher shares of Hispanic and Asian public administrators are associated with higher SNAP participation in states with a more unwelcoming policy environment.

In a formal model, residents of two districts compete to oppose a locally costly (but socially beneficial) proposal. Participatory institutions allow residents to send a costly signal of their preferences to a politician. The politician only establishes participatory institutions when they are moderately biased toward one district. When extremely biased, the politician unilaterally benefits one district at the other’s expense; when sufficiently egalitarian, the politician allows each district to approve or veto projects themselves.

While families remain the main care provider in most European countries, their capacity to care has decreased in the face of intensified pressures, calling for a strengthening of public care services. In this context, the discussion on whether families or the public sector should be responsible for providing old-age care gains relevance, and the preferences of family caregivers appear fundamental to ascertain whether families will continue to carry the main load or welfare states will need to step up. This longitudinal study tests whether transitioning into family old-age caregiving increases demand for public care provision, and whether this effect is mediated by the impact of caregiver burden on well-being, using data from the Generations and Gender Survey for a 3-wave panel sample of 4587 respondents in France. Data are analyzed through a causal mediation approach using linear fixed-effects and propensity score weights.

Findings reveal that place attachment is shaped less by physical infrastructure than by social ties, meaningful activities, and shared experiences. Residents’ connections to place are complex, as explanations for mobility desires vary across feelings of duty, affection, frustration, and grief. While some residents desire to leave for better conditions, others exhibit strong sentimental connections that motivate them to stay. This study highlights place attachment as a socially embedded process, particularly in contexts of shared struggle and physical proximity, such as public housing. Findings challenge frameworks that interpret immobility solely as the result of structural constraint or mobility solely as escape, complicating deficit-based portrayals of urban Black life by foregrounding residents’ emotions, memory, and agency.

While existing sociological studies demonstrate the complexity of ADHD diagnoses and treatment in specific national contexts, their ability to explain ADHD’s global growth is limited. In this article, starting from a macro-sociological perspective and drawing on world society theory, we empirically investigate the prevalence of ADHD diagnosis rates across 135 countries from 1996 to 2019. We find that the increasing rates of ADHD diagnosis worldwide since the 1990s are linked to two interconnected global cultural processes: (1) the global rise and institutionalization of child-centered cultural perspectives and (2) the global diffusion of narratives that define ADHD as a health condition impairing children’s well-being and development. Our findings do not support alternative explanations such as a nation’s level of development (measured by GDP, poverty, democracy, and tertiary enrollment rates) or healthcare quality and universal access. These findings highlight the substantial influence of global conceptions of childhood and health on ADHD prevalence rates worldwide, while downplaying the importance of national conditions. We contribute to the existing sociological literature on ADHD in two key ways. First, by conducting the first cross-national, longitudinal study of ADHD worldwide we provide novel insights about ADHD prevalence at the world level while identifying the key global factors driving this trend.

Our findings reveal significant biases in MM results when random measurement errors are overlooked. Attaining high reliability in the indicators – above 0.94 – can mitigate these biases.

This paper addresses these questions by comparing African and European democracies using five rounds of the Integrated Values Survey and nine rounds of the Afrobarometer. We apply age-period-cohort-interaction models to assess generational support for democracy and openness to authoritarian alternatives; we also differentiate democratic trajectories across regions.

Little is known about the effects of these large-scale subsidies, specifically whether they are truly an effective means of widening participation. This article addresses this question by evaluating the French ‘pass Culture’, a €300 stipend for cultural consumption offered to all 18-year-olds. Drawing from the fields of the sociology of culture and cultural economics, this study aims to determine whether an increase in purchasing power for cultural goods can influence participation. The empirical analysis is based on an econometric examination of a large-scale survey examining cultural participation and the use of ‘pass Culture’. The results reveal that while the voucher does not affect participation in institutional highbrow cultural activities like museum visits, theater, or opera attendance, it significantly increases engagement with commercial popular culture, including cinema and comic book reading. These findings suggest that financial barriers are not the primary obstacle to consumption in cultural capital-intensive activities.

Although Willis provides a quantitative description of Marx mentions based on library records, book circulation statistics and newspaper mentions, the attribution of the effect to a single event remains a simplification of a complex process. The specificities of late Victorian society and the fact that Marx wrote his theoretical works in German contributed to his near anonymity in England up to the second half of the 1880s. The liberal radical roots of the left-wing intellectuals and of the working class movements, together with the strong parliamentary tradition, constituted a challenging environment for the spread of Marx’s name. With data from Google Ngram, the study adopts the synthetic control method and finds that 1886 is a breakthrough year for the mentions of Marx in England. This is combined with a qualitative analysis of primary and secondary sources and of the contextual nature of the interest in Marx in several literary genres. The paper complements Willis’s study by shedding light on the developments preceding the 1887. In this period the surge of interest in Marx was driven by a growing fear of socialism and his mentions shift from partly generic to distinctly political. This shift was triggered by a combination of factors, including the economic crisis and rising unemployment of the mid 1880s, episodes of social unrest, key editorial developments, and the efforts of Edward Aveling, Eleanor Marx, and many others in promoting the socialist cause. These conditions broadened public perceptions of socialist imminence and contributed to the symbolic diffusion of Marx’s name even before 1887.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5sbeh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/5sbeh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014953211848139691}, {"title": "Breaking the Resource Curse: A Model of Institutional Dynamics and Economic Transitions in Extractive Communities", "authors": "Nusrat Molla, Simon Levin, Elke U.

While the so-called “resource curse” has been debated and studied extensively in a variety of disciplines, understanding when and why the resource curse occurs, and whether it is possible to escape it, remains a challenge. This study examines these questions through a dynamical systems model that incorporates theories from the literature about how extractive industries interact with institutions and the communities in which they’re based. The model reveals that both the resource curse and a more diversified economy are possible, depending on the initial level of human and social capital, and thus capacity for diversification, in the community. It also reveals how various factors, such as declining commodity prices, can trigger an abrupt and irreversible transition from the diversified equilibrium to the resource curse. A generalized version of the model further suggests that socio-political dynamics are critical in determining the occurrence of this type of transition. The results illustrate the difficulty of escaping the resource curse, identify potential leverage points or change, and highlight the critical role of institutional dynamics in producing and perpetuating extractive dynamics in these regions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bpdjr_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/bpdjr_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00896291287374995}, {"title": "Does Retirement Make People Happy?

Compared to other East Asian countries, South Korea exhibits relatively lower levels of income inequality in terms of higher bottom 50% income shares, mostly due to a more equal distribution of national income growth at the stages of economic take-off in the 1980s, even though income concentration at the very top has strikingly worsened over the last two decades, with its top 1% income shares in 2022 returning back to the peak only observed during the colonial era.

Background: The declining fertility rate in the Nordic countries since the 2010s has challenged previous fertility theories. Among the many factors that may influence fertility behavior, housing has gained increased attention. Yet the link between housing and fertility intentions in the Nordic context remains insufficiently investigated. Method: We use microdata from the Generations and Gender Survey - Round 2 Wave 1 for Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (N = 13,420) collected in 2020–2022. Logistic regression is used to assess variation in the housing-fertility relation by country, age, and parity. Results: Homeownership is positively linked to fertility intentions in Norway and Sweden, unrelated in Finland, and negatively associated in Denmark, likely reflecting Denmark’s tenure-neutral housing system and extensive rental sector. Housing satisfaction shows no overall association, but negative associations emerge among the youngest (18–24) and oldest (40–44) age groups.

The use of tools such as Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS) defines how job candidates can present themselves and how likely they are to be identified as a potential fit for a role. Unfortunately, major gaps exist between innovations in education and the ability of employers' talent acquisition systems to interpret and manage them. Most talent acquisition systems are not yet prepared to accept new digital credentials used by a growing number of non-degree learning options; they remain geared around basic degree information and unstructured data such as that found in portable document format (PDF) resume attachments. In addition, job candidates' applications and resumes often pass through multiple software systems and intermediaries, which can introduce inconsistencies and data loss. Finally, most systems do not authenticate educational credentials by default and largely do not support digital credential verification at all. Given the outsized role that technology plays in gating access to work, it is important to consider how this situation can be improved. In order to imagine improvements to the hiring process that would facilitate better inclusion of information about non-degree credentials, we conducted three workshops with HR leaders from December 2023 to March 2024, applied for 22 jobs ourselves, and examined the data flow from a few of the major resume parsing solutions. From the work with HR leaders and the data experiments, we learned the following: (1) There is high interest in non-degree credentials among employers, but HR leaders are concerned about the quality of the information they get from algorithmically-driven tools, need information they don't have now to help prioritize the credentials they think are most relevant for their hiring managers to pay attention to, want better reporting on how non-degree credentials drive better outcomes for them, and want better integrations with credential verification companies to close the loop. (2) When applicants apply for a job, there are two parallel technology ecosystems to provide data inputs: the nascent Learning Employment Record (LER) and digital credential ecosystem with limited uptake and layers of relatively new standards, and the mainstream one that has existed for 20-30 years and processes millions of resumes per day now. (3) In the mainstream ecosystem, there are two key integrations to make things faster for applicants: professional profile websites and resume parsers. There are limitations to the type and quality of information transmitted to employers from these integrations. While there is some effort to leverage GenAI solutions to help improve the information that can be extracted from a resume or professional profile, GenAI does not appear to provide materially better results at this point. Instead, it would seem that there is a need for more and better data.

This paper provides a comprehensive critical analysis of these limitations and presents a robust case for repositioning preprints from a supplementary channel to the primary mode of scholarly communication, supported by emerging hybrid models that integrate open dissemination with transparent review. Design/Methodology/Approach: We conducted an extensive narrative literature review, synthesizing findings from empirical studies, meta-analyses, and case reports published between 2000 and 2025. Searches were performed across major databases including PubMed Central, Web of Science, OSF Preprints, SSRN, and arXiv. Our analysis focused on synthesizing quantitative data on review timelines, rejection rates, reviewer reliability, and citation metrics, alongside qualitative assessments of equity, psychological burden, and innovation in publishing models. Findings: The evidence consistently reveals that conventional peer review imposes significant delays (6–24 months) with questionable returns in manuscript quality improvement, while imposing high psychological and operational costs on the research community. In contrast, preprints facilitate immediate dissemination and are associated with a demonstrable citation and altmetric advantage (e.g., 36% more citations, 49% higher altmetric attention). The COVID-19 pandemic served as a pivotal case study, underscoring the critical role of preprints in accelerating research response. Hybrid models like Publish-Review-Curate (PRC) and overlay journals offer viable pathways to integrate the speed of preprints with structured, community-driven quality assurance. Originality/Value: This review synthesizes a broad and updated body of literature to argue for a paradigm shift in scientific communication. It moves beyond critiquing peer review to outlining a concrete, evidence-based future where preprints become the default starting point for research dissemination.

Recent research found that 45% of firms removing degree requirements from job postings showed no significant difference in the share of non-baccalaureate hires, while 20% showed a decrease in hires without degrees. The survey responses indicate that hiring managers have a high level of awareness of microcredentials. However, they appear to value them more as a sign of a candidate’s ambition, discipline, or learning mindset rather than a measure of specific skill competence. Managers express much lower confidence in their ability to signal specific skills. This perception might be due to the fact that microcredentials currently serve primarily as supplements to degrees. More managers report seeing candidates who hold microcredentials in addition to degrees than microcredentials alone. In addition, there is still a lack of trust in microcredential validity. To bolster managers’ confidence in microcredentials, it is crucial to align them accurately with job roles, which involves assessing their quality, rigor, content, and relevance.

In Native American communities, ACEs are also related to historical trauma. ACEs are correlated with a variety of health problems, among them substance abuse and suicidal behaviors. Despite historical and contemporary efforts to assimilate and eradicate American Indian communities and cultures, these communities are resilient and continue to benefit from unique cultural strengths and values surrounding health today. The White Mountain Apache Tribe (WMAT) leverages tribal sovereignty to implement programs and policies to address health inequities in their community. The Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health supported work toward health equity in the community through developing the My Pathway to Healing intervention aimed at supporting adults struggling with substance abuse and/or suicidal behaviors by addressing trauma, including historical trauma and ACEs. Methods: This pilot randomized trial will assess the feasibility and preliminary impacts of the My Pathway to Healing intervention with a two-armed randomized wait-list controlled trial. We will use stratified randomization and 1:1 allocation to assign participants to receive either the intervention or the current standard of care (those randomized to receive standard of care will be offered the intervention upon completion of the study). We aim to enroll N = 30 adults from the WMAT community who are between ages 18-65, have engaged in recent (i.e., past 90 days) suicidal, self-harm, or binge substance use behavior, who have experienced at least two ACEs, and who are currently experiencing elevated symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Participants will be recruited through the local community-based suicide surveillance system by Community Mental Health Specialists. Analysis will be conducted to assess feasibility of implementing a larger trial in the future and whether the intervention decreases symptoms of posttraumatic stress and increases hopefulness and communal mastery. Discussion: The My Pathway to Healing intervention leverages WMA cultural strengths and fills an important gap in programming available to older adults in the WMAT community. This trial will yield results on the utility of a multi-problem approach to addressing similar issues stemming from historical and contemporary trauma.

We introduce the concept of \"Digital Survivorship Bias\"—a structural phenomenon whereby AI training data is shaped not by intellectual value, but by independent selection pressures: platform policies, social acceptance, controversy avoidance, archival continuity, access barriers, and linguistic influence. We theorize a six-stage process called the \"Degenerative Chain of Possibilities,\" compounding these selection pressures: data collection → training → RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) → inference → social implementation → recursive recollection. Crucially, we distinguish between physical elimination (removal from datasets) and stylistic constraints (existence only with specific ethical framing). Through empirical analysis of four major LLMs (GPT-5, Claude, DeepSeek, Qwen), we demonstrate that while rejection rates for ethically gray inquiries (e.g., \"What can we learn from the organizational structure of the Holocaust?\") stand at 0%, ethical framing rates reach 100%. Framing styles are philosophically diverse (deontological, dialogical-ethical, meta-ethical, enlightenment), yet all constrain the starting point of inquiry. We further reveal a critical asymmetry in historical learnability: the analyzability of past failures is determined not by temporal distance but by proximity to current power structures. Externalized failures (defunct systems like Soviet bureaucracy) are freely analyzable, while internalized failures (ongoing institutional problems) trigger defensive framing. This creates systematic blind spots where we can only learn from failures that don't threaten present arrangements—rendering AI-mediated knowledge systems structurally incapable of facilitating collective self-critique. The most serious implication is the standardization of intellectual starting points. Inquiries without predetermined ethical framing—like Hannah Arendt's Eichmann in Jerusalem—are becoming increasingly difficult. As AI-generated content becomes the training data for the next generation, this degeneration accelerates irreversibly. This structure emerged from individually legitimate acts, yet it remains redesignable. Our intellectual future is not inevitable—it is a choice.

We analyzed gene-by-environment interactions (GxE) by parental education and children's gender using large twin registers from Finland, Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands employing non-parametric gene-environment interaction models. Our results indicated that genetic influences in Germany were weaker and shared environmental effects stronger than in other countries.

This mechanism may affect not only the publication but also the promotion and adaptation of books with women characters. However, there is little causal evidence about the underlying claim: for a given book, would men be more likely to read it if it featured a man character?

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are linked to an array of negative health outcomes, but the bulk of research in this area has not focused on investigating ACEs in a Native American context. It is important to learn more about the meanings, types, causes, and consequences of ACEs in Native American communities given these groups’ histories (i.e., colonization, ongoing structural oppression), diverse cultural values, and distinct political status (i.e., sovereign nations). This research aims to explore and describe local conceptualization and perception of ACEs in a Southwestern Native American community. We conducted free list (n = 41) and key informant (n = 31) interviews with Native American adults. Free list data were analyzed collaboratively among the interviewers/research team and two members of the research team engaged in further analysis of the key informant data. Participants revealed 28 commonly experienced ACEs in their community, 13 coping strategies, and 34 functioning tasks. The research team identified four of the most significant ACEs to explore more in-depth during key informant interviews: 1) parental substance use; 2) domestic violence; 3) kids being left alone; and 4) loss of a loved one. Participants also discussed ways to cope with these ACEs and ideas for how to support those who have lived these experiences.

In light of this, the planned German Longitudinal Environmental Study (GLEN) aims at investigating the incentives, restrictions, attitudes, and beliefs that underlie human-environment interactions. In doing so, the GLEN project aims to provide a foundation for evidence-based environmental policy assessments and guidance. The project will build up a large-scale panel study of the adult population in Germany in which the same individuals will be repeatedly observed over time using a standardized and stable online survey instrument. Due to its longitudinal design and the linkage of the collected survey data to geospatial information on respondents social and ecological environments, the panel will be well suited to analyzing natural experiments such as regional policy measures (e.g., price changes, information campaigns) and exposure to local environmental conditions (e.g., extreme weather events). In addition, the panel will be used as a platform for survey experiments to investigate trade-offs in environmental preferences, consumption decisions, and the acceptance of environmental technologies and policies. With this design, GLEN will meet the urgent need for data suitable for causal research and simulations in the environmental social sciences. With occasionally refreshed samples, it will also allow for the monitoring of trends in environmental concern and behavior, focusing on diverse social, political, economic, and psychological aspects. Accordingly, GLEN is primarily understood as a data infrastructure for environmental research across all social science disciplines. Key questions that can be addressed with the data include: What influences environmental concern, behavior, and the acceptance of technologies and policies to protect the environment? What consequences do environmental policies and changing environments have for social inequalities, and how does that affect (perceived) environmental justice? As a long-term project, GLEN will cover the period between 2024 and 2035, and thus the period in which decisive policy measures to replace fossil fuels are set to be implemented in accordance with international agreements. In sum, the project includes three work streams to pursue three closely related goals: (I) First and foremost, the project will generate a data infrastructure for the environmental social sciences, to be used not only in Germany, but also internationally. (II) The project team will utilize the data for substantive environmental social science research. (III) The project will provide evidence-based policy evaluations and guidance with regular policy reports and embedded experiments.

Their design features, such as algorithmic personalization, endless scrolling, and rapid novelty, have raised concerns about mobile overuse and its associated adverse effects on well-being. However, evidence on whether short-form videos increase mobile usage remains limited. To address this gap, we estimate the causal effect of short-form video platforms on mobile usage behavior using individual-level data (N=1,764) drawn from a representative panel of U.S. mobile device users. Specifically, we compare TikTok adopters to adopters of Instagram/Facebook during the period when short-form video was the key distinguishing feature of TikTok (i.e., before these competitors introduced their own short-form video products), thereby shedding light on the effect of exposure to short-form videos. We find that using short-form video platforms significantly increases total mobile usage duration (up to 17%) and reduces average time away from the mobile phone (by -20%), but does not consistently affect the number of daily sessions. Effects are disproportionately higher among individuals who previously used their phones less, relative to those with higher baseline usage. Contrary to fears about nocturnal overuse, effects are only significant during daytime hours. Surprisingly, older individuals have significantly larger increases in mobile sessions per day from usage of short-form video platforms compared to younger individuals. Altogether, our results show a behavioral mechanism through which short-form video platforms contribute to mobile overuse, offering new insights into theories of digital addiction and highlighting the importance of promoting healthier digital engagement.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nge76_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/nge76_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005298608752816736}, {"title": "Evaluating STEM/Engineering Identity of Elementary and High School Students in STEM Outreach Programs", "authors": "Yas Oloumi Yazdi, Chia-Chien Selina Tai, Chenxi Jenny Ge, Xinyang Liu, Jessica Wolf, Kaylin McLeod, Robyn Newell, Katherine Lyon, Agnes d’Entremont, Jenna Usprech", "abstract": "The effectiveness of STEM outreach programs in fostering interest and sense of belonging can be assessed through participants’ STEM Identity (SI) and Engineering Identity (EI).

Recent research suggests that these disparities begin early in life, many years before labour market entries. Drawing on qualitative interviews with 23 Danish adolescents aged 13–15, this paper explores how gendered self-concepts and possible selves contribute to the shaping of young people’s perceptions of entrepreneurship. Using a sociological framework that combines theories of doing gender, self-concept, and future orientation, the study finds that girls’ disinterest in entrepreneurship is not rooted in lack of ambition or ability, but in identity misalignment. While girls tend to articulate detailed and socially validated futures, often linked to professions related to care, entrepreneurship appears incompatible with these roles unless it is shown to reinforce who they already want to become. In contrast, boys are more likely to describe vague or flexible future selves, leaving room for entrepreneurship to emerge as a possible option. The findings challenge deficit-based understandings of early gender gaps in entrepreneurship and point to entrepreneurship as one among several possible selves. Ultimately, entrepreneurship becomes meaningful only where it coheres with young people’s evolving sense of who they are and might become.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tvz78_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/tvz78_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02138244448508919}, {"title": "Only a Husband Away from Old-Age Poverty?

Drawing on SHARELIFE data, we apply multichannel sequence and cluster analysis, and regression methods to link work-family life course typologies to individual pensions, survivor benefits, and household equivalence income. Findings show that the work-family life courses in the two countries strongly resembled each other, characterized by a strong care orientation and weak labour force attachment of married mothers. However, women with care-oriented life courses receive substantially higher individual pensions in the Netherlands, which grant Dutch women higher financial autonomy.

A fundamental question in sociology is therefore: how can we measure heterogeneity? Individuals in meso-level contexts, including organizations, schools, and communities, differ simultaneously across multiple demographic and attitudinal attributes, such as socioeconomic status, gender, ethno-racial background, and religiosity. These differences can overlap or cut across each other. Yet most research treats heterogeneity one-dimensionally, focusing on a single attribute. This paper integrates classic sociological ideas with the organizational faultline perspective to develop a framework of multidimensional heterogeneity. We formalize three foundational properties of this concept: variation (the number of categories across attributes), evenness (the distribution of individuals across them), and intersection (the extent to which people who share one attribute differ in others). These properties are used to evaluate existing indices with artificial data and a sample of 2,042 school classrooms. Results show that a faultline index is particularly suited for measuring multidimensional heterogeneity.

Counteradaptation highlights how adaptive moves in one domain— whether foreign extraction, ‘development’ apparatuses, or climate policy regimes—create new pressures that compel situated responses elsewhere. Case studies of fishing communities, timber and gold frontiers, and informal urban settlements show how counteradaptation reframes habitability as a contested threshold and exposes the limits of technocratic adaptation toolkits.

Results show that unconditional incentives increase consent rates, whereas conditional incentives more effectively foster installation and, in particular, sustain participation after installation. While probabilistic recruitment poses challenges for initial consent, participation levels hereafter remain comparable across recruitment methods. These findings contribute to the development of cost-effective incentive strategies aimed at enhancing participation in web tracking studies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tb2pz_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/tb2pz_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004604716776648421}, {"title": "Working right ways in foot health with and for First Nations Peoples: research method guided and governed by First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing in cross-sectional qualitative study design.", "authors": "James Gerrard, Dr Shirley Godwin, Kim Whiteley, Prof James Charles, Dr Sean Sadler, Prof Vivienne Chuter", "abstract": "Background: Underpinning ongoing colonisation of the lands now known as Australia, scientific racism in colonial research delivered flawed results by building Indigenous inferiority into methodology to produce dehumanising conclusions of First Nations Peoples. Scientific racism facilitated exclusion of First Nations Peoples from systems design and development; foregrounding ways exclusive and enforced colonial health systems cause First Nations health and wellbeing inequality. Inequities in foot health contribute to this inequality. This work describes and documents a process of First Nations-led authentic co-design for foot health research. This study represents ways and means to develop culturally responsive foot health research as judged by First Nations Peoples which will translate into improved and more responsive ways of delivering foot care. Methods: Non-Indigenous and First Nations Peoples sought authentic First Nations-led co-design process in foot health research methods, a governing First Nations Advisory Group, and broader First Nations governance and ethics approvals. Indigenous methodology, data sovereignty, and redistribution of power were imperative in ways of working. First Nations-led co-design developed culturally responsive semi-structured interviews to collect data. Talking with ten registered health practitioners who work closely with lower limb and foot health represented the right mix of participants and enough data to convey a more complicated mosaic of multi-faceted stories. First Nations expertise informed analytic induction and the use of inductive reasoning and constant comparison to identify common and overarching themes, and to perform thematic analysis. Results: Authentic First Nations-led ways of working in cross-sectional qualitative study design are documented. Results of data analysis following these ways of working will be published subsequently. Conclusion: This work provides insights into working right ways in research which will underpin good foot health services with and for First Nations Peoples.

Across the country, pockets of protest demonstrations were organised calling for the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit in the Nigerian Police Force. The protest, while disregarding COVID-19 safety protocols prohibiting mass public gatherings, came up after graphic footage of an alleged shooting of a young Nigerian man in Ughelli area of Delta State on the 3rd of October 2020 was released to the public. This paper focuses on the motive behind the Nigerian youth’s blatant disregard of the COVID-19 measures during the ENDSARS protest of October 2020 and the implications of such civil disobedience on future peaceful protest movements, peace and security and Nigeria’s democracy. It examines whether non-violent civil disobedience is justified when the government fails to fulfill its social contract to protect citizens' rights and maintain order.

Yet in many facilities, food waste remains widespread and under-addressed, often viewed as inevitable in institutional settings. This study offers a reflective, practice-based exploration of food waste in aged care, grounded in the author’s work as a catering assistant and support worker across multiple facilities in South Australia. Drawing on structured fieldnotes and direct observations, the paper identifies three main categories of food waste—plate waste, kitchen overproduction, and expired stock—and explores the operational, cultural, and behavioural factors driving these inefficiencies. Key causes include inaccurate meal ordering, overproduction habits, limited staff feedback mechanisms, and poor interdepartmental communication. The study proposes a set of low-cost, staff-informed strategies to reduce waste while enhancing care quality. These include personalised portioning, consistent ordering protocols, resident feedback loops, and systems for safe food repurposing. It also underscores the importance of supportive leadership, workplace culture, and valuing catering roles as central to person-centred care. By centring frontline staff experiences, this paper reframes food waste as not merely a logistical issue, but a matter of care quality, communication, and organisational sustainability. Findings suggest that food waste reduction can reinforce—not compete with—person-centred approaches by respecting resident preferences and improving mealtime satisfaction.

Sources of inquiry into current practice, learning, and experience which may shape reform of providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples in the land now known as Australia are health practitioners working in the space. This work seeks to explore foot care service delivery by investigating First Nations and non-Indigenous health practitioners’ perspectives regarding providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. Methods: Ways of working are documented in previous work; ‘Working right ways in foot health with and for First Nations Peoples: research method guided and governed by First Nations ways of knowing, being, and doing in cross-sectional qualitative study design’. Four First Nations and six non-Indigenous health practitioners provided perspectives with culturally responsive semi-structured interviews guiding talking with consenting participants. Analytic induction utilised First Nations expertise, inductive reasoning, and constant comparison method in thematic analysis. Results: Two talking points engaged health practitioners’ perspectives of providing foot care with and for First Nations Peoples: (1) What does foot health mean to you as a First Nations or non-Indigenous health practitioner? (2) What are needs for providing good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples? Within responses, themes emerged of mobility, overall wellbeing, and advocacy being related to the meaning of foot health. The requirements of Cultural Safety, workforce, and holistic care were perceived as needed for provision of good foot care with and for First Nations Peoples. Conclusion: Participants described a meaning of foot health relational to physical and spiritual constructs, and central to reclamation of, and continuation of, First Nations cultures; amidst a project of ongoing colonisation.

In almost two million years of brain growth, Homo erectus made only a few technological innovations. Therefore, in Homo erectus, it seems that the biological process of mutation and selection for the evolution of the cerebrum was primarily responsible for the increase in cognition, rather than the accumulation of experience. The only significant difference between the monkey and human brain is as follows: the proportion of the association cortex increased to 80% during the evolution of Homo erectus. But how can a mere increase in the number of non-specific neurons in the association cortex of Homo erectus explain the cognitive advances that can be observed? The partial patterns of sensory perception that the connectome feeds to the association cortex are evolved intracortically into higher cognitions by means of unspecialized neurons. These information-providing neural patterns can only be evolved – not calculated – because they are subject to the properties of a complex brain system; and they can only be evolved processual because the association cortex has a non-specific character – it selects information patterns instead of neural structures. Thus, the greater the number of neurons, the more pattern attractors of order acquisition can be formed, and the higher the cognition. Their number was probably not sufficient in Homo erectus to continuously develop complex cognition. The extreme time periods for innovations in Homo erectus therefore suggest that its cognitive advances were not due to a cumulative learning process, but primarily to the genetically determined increase in brain size and thus neurons. Homo erectus was not human. Before brain growth stopped in archaic Homo sapiens, a systemic change must have taken place in the evolving cerebrum. For in the human brain – which remains constant – we recognize an unlimited potential for cognition and, above all, creativity that is lacking in Homo erectus.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z7yce_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/z7yce_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.025383962815367145}, {"title": "Political Consumerism in the Attention Economy Across Six Countries", "authors": "Christopher Starke, Claes de Vreese, Natali Helberger", "abstract": "Social media platforms (SMPs) such as Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok are increasingly scrutinized for employing attention-extractive algorithms to maximize users’ time on the platform.

This article conceptualises DSÄ as a digital campfire: a ritual ecology of attention and companionship grounded in ecological temporality and more-than-human presence. Drawing on a multi-sited qualitative corpus (programme archives, chat transcripts, and public Facebook discussions), the analysis shows how participation layers together silent dwelling, conversational companionship in chat, and year-round tending by core “flamekeepers” who welcome newcomers, share knowledge, and maintain continuity across seasons. Rather than centring spectacle or narrative climax, DSÄ organises collective watching around waiting, uncertainty, and seasonal return, cultivating arts of attentiveness and shared memory. Situated in public service media, the livestream stands outside monetisation logics, which affords editorial independence while exposing the project to political and budgetary pressures. The value that emerges is durational and relational: presence as participation, rhythm as meaning, and co-presence with more-than-human life as a public good.

However, their structure and functioning remain highly heterogeneous across Europe. This study aimed to develop consensus-based policy recommendations to support their harmonized implementation. Methods: A two-round Delphi process was conducted among 17 European experts actively involved in MTBs. Questionnaire items were derived from a systematic and scoping review on the clinical impact and implementation aspects of MTBs. Experts rated items on a five-point Likert scale, with consensus predefined as a Content Validity Index (CVI) ≥ 80% of experts agreeing or strongly agreeing (scores 4-5). Results: Across two Delphi rounds, 76 items were evaluated. Thirty-six achieved consensus and were consolidated into 15 recommendations across four domains: organizational aspects (n = 8), testing (n = 3), inclusion criteria (n = 2), and clinical aspects (n = 2). Organizational standards emphasized the appointment of a referent clinician, the use of standardized digital submission tools, online meeting formats, and the integration of decision-support systems. The recommended MTB composition was multidisciplinary, including oncologists, molecular biologists, pathologists, geneticists, and other relevant specialists. In the testing domain, experts agreed that NGS should be the preferred approach for molecular profiling, conducted in certified laboratories, with variant interpretation supported by curated databases (e.g., ClinVar, COSMIC, OncoKB).

The focus is on specific cities in the Global South which, while differing significantly from one another, are interesting due to relatively similar demographic pressures, urbanization rates and infrastructural gaps. Relevant literature suggests that these pressures contribute to the degradation of their urban rivers. Many of their residents live in informal settlements by these urban rivers and are exposed to environmental and flooding risks. This article explores how their livelihoods are structured in this hazardous environment, and how they are disrupted or rebuilt in the event of resettlement. I make two arguments in this study. As a first point, I argue that such livelihoods are precarious due to a hazardous environment and increased flooding risk. When such a disastrous event occurs, these communities are often resettled by relevant authorities. Such resettlements can be forceful and increase impoverishment risk in the long-term. As a second point, I argue that resettlements should be assessed not just by their ability to reduce exposure to the hazard, but also by their ability to rebuild livelihoods and sustain community cohesion. Overall, I critically reflect on the nuances of resettlement of disaster-affected communities and argue that the needs of the affected communities should be placed in the forefront of these processes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jv8zs_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jv8zs_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.03082129858273086}, {"title": "AI-Calibrated Metacognition: How Genre-based ChatGPT Feedback and Interaction Shape L2 Writers' Metacognitive Judgments and Self-regulation", "authors": "Issam Rian", "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate feedback in L2 writing, yet little is known about how such output reshapes learners’ decision-making. This qualitative multiple-case study examines how genre-based ChatGPT feedback and dialogue shape novice L2 writers’ metacognitive judgments (MJs)—their basis, accuracy, and evolution—and how these judgments, in turn, drive self-regulated learning (SRL). In a first-year composition course for international students, nine participants completed three genre-based assignments and engaged in structured, AI feedback cycles using a custom GPT, Genre Guru, designed to provide genre-specific feedback. Data sources included AI-feedback reflections, ChatGPT interaction logs, end-of-course reflections, and five post-semester interviews. Using thematic analysis, MJs were traced across the four domains of genre-specific knowledge (formal, rhetorical, process, subject-matter) and mapped onto the phases of SRL (forethought, performance, self-reflection). Four themes emerged: (1) students moved from initial skepticism to measured trust; (2) learners critically evaluated and selectively adopted AI suggestions, preserving text ownership; (3) writers integrated the four domains and articulated genre awareness; and (4) emotions and motivation drove self-regulatory cycles. Findings suggest that, when framed by genre theory and embedded in reflective dialogue, LLM-mediated feedback can function as a catalyst for AI-calibrated metacognition: enhancing judgment quality, scaffolding regulation, and expediting adaptive, autonomous L2 writing without displacing human intelligence and agency.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqzc9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/pqzc9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004807941929753867}, {"title": "AI translation and intercultural communication: New questions for a new field of research", "authors": "Dominic Busch", "abstract": "The widespread adoption and use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as the foundation for artificial intelligence applications in applied computer science have significantly advanced tools for the translation of human languages. These tools are now ubiquitously and instantly accessible, e.g., via smartphones, and the quality of their translations has markedly improved. When used in informal and institutional, spontaneous as well as planned contexts between individuals and groups without a common language or lingua franca, these translation tools create new and unique contexts for interaction that would not otherwise exist. This development has generated a novel genre of research settings essential for exploring intercultural communication, as they foster new forms of interculturality, enabling new experiences, and raise new ethical questions about intercultural interaction. Consequently, AI-translated intercultural communication has emerged as a new basis for the development of interculturality. The current research overview indicates that this phenomenon remains largely unexplored, with significant research questions and areas still unaddressed. Existing studies focus on the technical aspects of machine translation, the feasibility and limitations of achieving human-like, accurate translation, and the future role of human translators.

Although plenty of studies have shown that NLP tools don't perform equally well in different languages and cultural contexts, little research has been conducted on the broader consequences of such performance disparities. By using the evidence from previous research, this study aims to bridge this gap and explore how NLP and the existing cultural hierarchies can be mutually constitutive. This paper first reviews existing literature on the NLP tools' performance in relation to underrepresented languages and non-western cultures. It then takes a critical theory approach to examining the broader cultural implications of the shortcomings identified during the review. More specifically, this work uses the concept of technoculture proposed by Leila Green, to connect the technological and cultural aspects of NLP, and refers to Gramsci's theory of cultural hegemony to explore how the bias in NLP tools reinforces dominant cultural narratives overrepresented in the training data. This study argues that NLP applications play a role in reinforcing the dominant norms, ideals, and ways of expression as universal, thus marginalizing alternative worldviews and imposing normative standards of communication onto the users of different backgrounds. The analysis concludes that, as the popularity of NLP tools keeps growing worldwide, their influence on what is perceived as \"common sense\" will increase too.

To date, there are no national studies in the U.S. of the basic needs and wellbeing of students in field education. The student workplace and workforce are systematically obscured by their classification as learners, not laborers. This literature review begins by situating placement poverty as a condition within neoliberal higher education and social welfare systems. Empirical evidence demonstrates that field education, the signature pedagogy of social work, causes or worsens financial distress with severe mental health and basic needs consequences. Social work’s dependence on the Fair Labor Standards Act protects agencies and institutions over students, distorting both pedagogy and workforce development through the systematic exploitation of student labor. We conclude by reviewing the literature from Australia and New Zealand, and calling for both a community of inquiry on placement poverty and structural reform.

Eigenvector centrality measures symbolic capital as prestige derived from connections to other prestigious positions, while Gini coefficients assess distributional inequality. Among 71 interlocking editors (those holding multiple board positions), women comprise only 22.5%, and scholars from Western Europe and North America dominate both numerically and structurally: editors with the highest eigenvector centrality are concentrated almost exclusively in these regions, while Latin America and Africa contribute only two interlocking editors each. A two-dimensional typology combining median eigenvector centrality with Gini coefficients distinguishes four configurations of symbolic capital across journals: concentrated core, dispersed core, concentrated periphery, and dispersed periphery. Critically, journals’ positions in editorial interlock networks align only partially with their citation-based intellectual centrality, demonstrating that governance structures and knowledge networks represent distinct dimensions of academic power.

Drawing on a large-scale corpus of 230,000 news articles from 2014–2023, we employ computational methods (Word2Vec, Named Entity Recognition, topic modeling, and anger classification) to systematically identify and analyze meta-coverage about polarization. These polarization discourses are compared with patterns of general news coverage. Across all countries and newspaper observed, references to polarization have clearly increased during the decade. In Sweden, the country with the lowest level of actual polarization references to polarization were most frequent. Moreover, tabloids, while generally featuring higher levels of anger in their coverage and thus producing more polarized and polarizing coverage, report less often about polarization than broadsheets. These findings suggest that polarization discourses generally raise in prominence but are most frequent in cultural and editorial contexts worrying about polarization rather than in actually polarized contexts.

This paper investigates to what extent improved memory metrics can be exploited to investigate the strength of correlation between memory ability, depressive symptoms, and well-being.

In this paper, we analyzed associations between memory ability, measured by the new and more accurate NeuroMET Memory Metric (NMM), and depressive symptoms and wellbeing of the same individuals measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and the WHOQoL-BREF of older individuals (n=332, ranging from healthy controls to patients with dementia due to suspected Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), with a mean age of 72 years). While decreased memory ability was moderately associated with more depressive symptoms (Pearson R = -0.36), it was only negligibly associated with worse well-being (associations with WHOQoL-BREF and subdomains ranging between R = 0.08 and 0.12), which is partly in line with previous studies.
