Officers have a variety of tactics at their disposal besides arrest that they use for less serious offenses when they judge the underlying behavior to be less severe. In departments led by a chief with special expertise in crime control, the chief's directives to change the severity threshold at which officers make arrests are a source of information about the most effective practices. However, if officers are uncertain whether their chief is swayed by political pressures, those directives will be less persuasive, especially when they align with what influential advocates want. This mechanism represents a constraint on the effectiveness of departments where chiefs have limited means to force subordinate compliance.

Lower-ranking officials are more likely to join nonprofits linked to government ministries, which receive higher-value contracts when former bureaucrats are in leadership roles.

Alternatively, when aspiring autocrats make it difficult to work with local partners, donors might back down, decreasing support for democracy promotion.

However, opposition MPs were not more critical of the executive in periods when democracy was eroding. The findings have important implications for understanding the institutional role of parties and legislatures in the process of backsliding.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/lsq.70041", "doi": "10.1111/lsq.70041", "journal_full": "Legislative Studies Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005706045342716681}, {"title": "Inside parties: How party rules shape membership and responsiveness KernellGeorgia, Inside Parties: How Party Rules Shape Membership and Responsiveness.

Yet this binary framing overlooks the nuanced realities of disconnection as both a constraint and a deliberate strategy, often framed as digital divide. Drawing on a 3-year study with roofless individuals in Berlin, this article advances the concept of the “disconnection divide” to foreground the complex interplay between “voluntary” and imposed forms of digital dis/connection. Our ethnographic findings illustrate that maintaining digital access is often precarious, shaped by device theft, limited charging opportunities, and unstable internet connections. Nonetheless, our participants also opt to disconnect, seeking respite from familial demands, intrusive relationships, or expectations imposed by social services. Frequently, they even use digital technology, such as gaming and streaming, to disconnect from their surroundings. These shifting fault lines – where disconnection simultaneously operates as an act of resistance, a coping mechanism, and an enforced condition – connect existing literature on voluntary disconnection in privileged contexts and imposed disconnection in marginalized settings. By emphasizing this ambivalence, the disconnection divide provides a critical new lens on digitally mediated inequality.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251385461", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251385461", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006795840829214139}, {"title": "(Dis)locating South Asia: Diasporic markets in the global streaming landscape", "authors": "Anirban K.

In the era of bundled entertainment capsules, such aggregators capitalize on the multiple sub-identities within the umbrella of “South Asian diaspora.” Through this analysis, we also show how “South Asia” is produced as a territorial category and a potential market through the nexus of cultural hegemony and capitalist markets, rather than a taken-for-granted identity of emotional belongingness.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251387450", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251387450", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01262477468969636}, {"title": "Expressive Data: Conceptualizing Political Expression Through Social Media Feeds", "authors": "Chelsea Butkowski", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2025.2579716", "doi": "10.1080/10584609.2025.2579716", "journal_full": "Political Communication", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0062036037085849705}, {"title": "The Limits of Virality: Music Creators and Platform Negotiation in the Era of Short-Form Video", "authors": "Alexandria Arrieta", "abstract": "As the lifespan of virality on TikTok has become increasingly short and operates at a smaller scale, music creators are grappling with what it means to be successful in this later stage of the platform. For this study, I conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with music artists and creators about how short-form video platforms like TikTok have affected the way they work and create music. Many participants believe that while the creation of viral content based on memes and covers of popular songs affords constant visibility, it does not result in the monetary or career milestones that they desire, so they need to use different approaches. In this article, I characterize this new period of online musical labor as a period defined by “platform negotiation,” in which creators evaluate platform demands and work to approach their content creation in ways that prioritize their personal and professional goals. This includes strategic decision-making to negotiate their presence—which can include their identity, brand, image, etc.—across platforms over time.

We build an overlapping-generations climate-economy model with a rich demographic structure, allowing population growth and survival probabilities to vary over time. These features endogenously determine the age composition of society and shape aggregate preferences. A central result of our framework is an aggregation result: despite the heterogeneity across cohorts, the planner’s problem can be recast as a representative-agent model with a time-varying social discount factor that reflects demographic dynamics. Notably, as the population ages, the discount factor declines, causing society to behave as if it were more impatient. We use this framework to study how current global demographic trends affect the social cost of carbon-the model-based measure of the economic cost of climate change. We find that this cost is significantly higher under medium- and high-fertility scenarios, driven by greater emissions from larger populations. These effects are partially offset by higher discounting in ageing societies. Relative to a benchmark model with no demographic change, the initial social cost of carbon rises by 20% under medium fertility and by 57% under high fertility. Global temperatures also increase more sharply in these scenarios, suggesting that demographic trends will exacerbate the climate problem.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf118", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueaf118", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013554740857913528}, {"title": "Give Me a Pass: Flexible Credit for Entrepreneurs in Colombia", "authors": "Lasse Brune, Xavier Giné, Dean Karlan", "abstract": "Although microcredit has reached millions, recent randomised evaluations find limited average business impacts.

We find that bank stocks experience large, permanent declines at the onset of crises. These losses predict commensurate long-term declines in banks’ earnings and dividends, rather than elevated future equity returns. Bank losses are primarily driven by write-downs of nonperforming assets, not asset sales during panics. Forceful liquidity-based interventions during crises predict only small, temporary increases in bank market value.

However, whether individual gains in higher education create a more inclusive society depends on why higher education is associated with more positive attitudes. Education may shape attitudes directly, by fostering inclusive values, or indirectly, by shielding the highly educated from competition with immigrants. Over time, if the effect is direct, the expansion of education leads younger cohorts to hold increasingly positive views. In contrast, if the effect is indirect, the advantage conferred by higher education may erode as it becomes more widespread, potentially weakening its liberalizing influence on the population. Using multivariate regression analysis, I test these competing hypotheses for the UK by examining whether the gap in attitudes between high and low educated has narrowed as the British and immigrant populations have become more educated. I use the British Election Study and the British Social Attitudes Survey, which cover ATI between 1961 and 2021 for cohorts born throughout the twentieth century. In line with a direct effect of higher education, I find that graduates have consistently had more positive attitudes than non-graduates across generations, even relative to the expansion of education. However, I find that all younger cohorts, including the high educated, are increasingly more likely to believe that immigrants take jobs from the British-born and increase crime.

To address this gap, this study explores how Syrian parents who risked crossing the Mediterranean to reach Europe interpret their migration from the standpoint of their settled lives. This perspective allows for tracing how the reasoning behind the risky decision evolved—from its origins in Syria (or the first country of asylum) to reflections rooted in the host countries of Sweden and Denmark. Across these spatial and temporal shifts, parents' narratives reveal the contradictory values they attach to migration, shaped by the complex dynamics of parent–child relationships. These contradictions are examined through the lens of the moral theory of risk. From this perspective, the notion of virtuous risking for the sake of one's children—initially central to parents' justification of their decision—gradually loses significance within the context of their new lives in Europe. This dynamic lies at the core of the evolving meanings parents attach to both risk and migration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70143", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70143", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9861546229023124}, {"title": "Time and Family Life in Diplomatic Mobility: Temporal Experiences Under a Regular Mobile Work Regime", "authors": "Jin L.

Drawing on ethnography with four active‐duty diplomatic service families, which include diplomats, their accompanying partners, and children, it examines the families' temporal experiences under a regularly mobile work regime. By conceptualising migrant temporality, this paper argues that institutionalised mobility not only gives rise to temporal uncertainties and discontinuities, but also reinforces familial bonds and agency through structured rhythms. Besides, this paper points out that diplomatic infrastructures provide familiar living environments and a sense of temporal continuity. However, their high level of homogeneity also blurs families' perceptions of temporal and spatial transitions, often generating a sense of ‘unreal’ regarding time.

Drawing on 45 life‐history interviews with Mexican professionals in Vancouver and Seattle and their parents in Monterrey, the study situates these strategies within the broader context of North American economic integration since NAFTA. Rather than engaging in family migration projects, upper‐middle‐class families invest in elite international education to cultivate cosmopolitan dispositions and transnational networks from an early age, enabling their children to navigate ‘highly skilled’ migration regimes in the United States and Canada. I develop the concept of credentialized aspirations to describe how the iterative accumulation of credentials—degrees, language proficiency, and professional experience—functions as a mechanism for sustaining social mobility under conditions of neoliberal uncertainty. This analysis reveals how regional integration, private education infrastructures, and meritocratic migration policies intersect to shape the geographies of privilege and mobility in North America.

We present a model in which individuals strategically manage the tradeoff between expressing dissent and avoiding punishment through self-censorship while an authority adapts its policies to minimize both total expressed dissent and punishment costs. We study the model analytically and in simulation to derive conditions separating defiant individuals who express their desired dissent in spite of punishment from self-censoring individuals who fully or partially limit their expression. We find that for any population, there exists an authority policy that leads to total self-censorship.

Here, we show that the model that is known to realistically capture both homophily and social balance exhibits a phase transition phenomenon where, above a critical social connectivity, an explosive transition toward strong polarization must occur. The model allows us to understand the empirical inflation of polarization during the last decades as a function of the observed increased values of social connectivity.

In 2020, the Census Bureau adopted differential privacy to protect the confidentiality of individual responses through a disclosure avoidance system that injects noise into census data tabulations. The Bureau subsequently posed an open question: Could stronger privacy guarantees be obtained for the 2020 US Census compared to their published guarantees, or equivalently, had the privacy budgets been fully utilized? In this paper, we address this question affirmatively by demonstrating that the 2020 US Census provides significantly stronger privacy protections than the officially published guarantees suggest at each of the eight geographical levels, from the national level down to the block level. This finding is enabled by our precise tracking of privacy losses using f -differential privacy, applied to the composition of private queries across these geographical levels. Our analysis reveals that the Census Bureau introduced unnecessarily high levels of noise to meet the specified privacy guarantees for the 2020 Census. Consequently, we show that noise variances could be reduced by 15.08% to 24.82% while maintaining nearly the same level of privacy protection for each geographical level, thereby improving the accuracy of privatized census statistics.

Using representative survey data of US engineers, I find that the majority disregarded the recognition, accountability, and remediation of tech bias as part of their professional duties. Arguing that engineers’ grappling with tech bias is not a detached professional assessment but a sensemaking practice entwined with other ideological commitments, I find that politically conservative engineers were far less likely than their more liberal peers to see tech bias concerns as part of their professional duties. Tellingly, engineers who endorsed traditional ideologies in the professional culture of engineering about the defense of epistemic purity of their work were also less likely to see tech bias concerns as part of their responsibilities.

National symbols, such as mandatory flag displays, are common tools used by states to assert authority and foster integration. This paper investigates non-compliance with such obligations in Catalonia, where many municipalities do not display the Spanish flag on town hall facades despite legal requirements. Drawing on original data from nearly one thousand municipalities between 2021 and 2024, we explore the drivers of this symbolic resistance. Contrary to expectations centred on elite strategy or state enforcement capacity, neither judicial orders nor contemporary party affiliation retain explanatory power once we control for voter preferences. Instead, the most robust drivers are localised, bottom-up, and historic. Most interestingly, we find that flag absence is overwhelmingly predicted by informal local independence referendums organised a decade earlier. After eliminating alternative mechanisms -- institutionalised path dependency, voter segmentation and current activist presence -- we hypothesise that this effect captures entrenched and enduring resistance norms within the local independence communities, which shift mayors' cost-benefit calculations. Notably, these effects are present for both secessionist and non-secessionist mayors, and for the latter, appear to override legal threats and amplify their sensitivity to local pro-independence support.

We analyze a unique dataset of over half a million posts from all German members of parliament and their official party accounts across four platforms – Facebook, X, Instagram, and TikTok.

Using a mixed-method approach that combines Large Language Model–based frame classification, stance detection, and network analysis, this study operationalizes Discursive Polarization across ideological, affective, and interactional dimensions. Findings reveal that while all protest debates on TikTok are polarized, disruptive protests trigger particularly intense attacks, diverting attention away from policy-oriented climate discussions. However, politicians from conservative and far-right parties consistently frame all activists as extremists, criminals, or threats to public order, with far-right accounts dominating both content production and audience support. Network analyses demonstrate that far-right politicians and their supporters form coordinated and highly connected clusters in which both emotionally positive and hostile user engagement reinforces elite-driven antagonism. Even moderate and supportive posts by centrist or left-wing politicians attract disproportionate backlash, illustrating asymmetric polarization dynamics driven by partisan user networks. Overall, the study shows that political TikTok debates around climate protest are consistently polarized along ideological lines, but that disruptiveness intensifies antagonistic engagement and weakens Connective Action among supporters. Most crucially, far-right politicians emerge as the clear beneficiaries of TikTok’s algorithmic affordances, which—coupled with connected outrage that mobilizes their supporters—enable them to dominate debates and entrench Discursive Polarization through Connective Counteraction.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q42gb_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/q42gb_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013111192752269463}, {"title": "Does the Built Environment Shape Voter Participation?

The model suggests that these three form the bare minimum conditions that are needed for any want, desire, or goal to emerge, be pursued, and ultimately be satisfied. It draws an analogy to the disease triangle in plant pathology, where disease only occurs when there is the presence of a susceptible host, a virulent pathogen, and a favourable environment, in the same sense, the TRM says that the absence of any one of the elements results in want not being fulfilled or efforts being redirected. Unlike existing motivational theories, such as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, that describes what humans want, whereas the TRM answers how can a want exist or proceed. It considers human life as if it’s an interacting field of energy, limited by availability of time, access to resources, and monetary means. Empirical data used here was collected through a survey I conducted with 80 respondents with a simple questionnaire to assess how goal achievement relates to TRM availability, revealing significant correlation between domains (r = .34 to .51), a three-factor structure presented by exploratory factor analysis (EFA; loadings&gt;|0.40|, total variance explained was 100%), and decent predictive power (R2 = .35 in regression) for an initial pilot study.

Within a measurable \"scope\" and an information filtration, we define probabilistic relevance as primitive, relate it to decision relevance via Blackwell monotonicity, and characterize static completeness as (approximate) point identification while dynamic completeness requires the absence of any future relevant arrivals. We distinguish institutional regimes—closed versus expandable scope—and show non-confirmability results in expandable scopes: finite evidence cannot certify either the absence of omitted relevant variables (static) or the absence of future relevant information (dynamic).

Autistic children may find pubertal changes harder to navigate, due to sensitives surrounding sensory experiences, and difficulty with change. Our prospectively registered mixed methods systematic review (Registration: PROSPERO2023 CRD42023446750) aimed to synthesise research on Autism and puberty. Methods Included studies focused on puberty in Autistic people (including self-identifying) and those supporting them. Searches were limited to English language sources from 2013 - July 2023. We searched: Medline, APA PsycINFO, and CINAHL (all via EBSCOhost), and Web of Science (via Clarivate). Studies were subjected to Convergent Integrated synthesis (Joanna Briggs Institute). Quality assessments were undertaken using Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Results 3,546 unique records were identified, and 61 items were included in the review. Most papers were high quality. We identified five themes. First, many studies compared Autistic and non-Autistic people, but few differences were identified, with puberty characterised as a universal experience. Second, parents felt unprepared for their child’s puberty, and uncertain of their future. Third, additional education in areas of puberty and sex were identified as needed for Autistic people, and those caring for them. Fourth, breaking norms was explored at length; with many parents worrying their child was not normal in behaviour and development. Finally described were physical changes of puberty and challenges these bring, specifically difficulties around menarche and menstruation. Limitations of studies included a lack of diversity (ethnicity; few fathers) and restricted consideration of confounding factors and author impact on research. Discussion Co-developed interventions are required, to facilitate understanding consent, navigating pubertal changes, and learning skills. The synthesised research did not focus on comfort and wellbeing, but more so on normality, or perceived lack of, of Autistic young people.

According to adaptation-level theories and theories of immigrant socioeconomic integration and segmented assimilation, this difference may be due to migrant-origin workers having lower job quality expectations and weaker reactions to low-quality jobs, due to their awareness of structural labour market disadvantages. However, these assumptions have rarely been tested empirically. First, we expect migrant-origin workers to have lower job quality expectations than native-origin workers. Second, we expect that migrant-origin workers will experience less job dissatisfaction when their job quality expectations are unmet. Third, we hypothesize that, among migrant-origin workers, job dissatisfaction will be a weaker predictor of turnover intentions and job changes. We analyse a longitudinal sample of workers in the Netherlands, focusing on job quality facets concerning wages and working hours. We examine differences between Dutch-origin workers and first- and second-generation migrants estimating random-effects and fixed-effects models. We find that migrant-origin workers have similar wage and working hours expectations as Dutch-origin workers. They also report similar or higher levels of job dissatisfaction when their job quality expectations are unmet. When dissatisfied with their jobs, migrant-origin workers are as likely as Dutch-origin workers to express turnover intentions. Despite their intentions being similar, migrant-origin workers are generally less likely to change jobs in the following year.

In this paper, we analyze workplace segregation by social class background. We document substantial segregation by social background, over and above counterfactual segregation under random allocation of employees across workplaces. Moreover, we observe segregation levels over and above what would be expected under random allocation conditional on individual and workplace characteristics, including e.g. human capital, occupation, and workplace county.

This paper examines how the perceived self-fulfillment relevance of childbearing mediates the relationship between postmaterialist values and fertility intentions, and how this interplay is moderated by expectations of welfare-state childcare support. Drawing on the Rapporto Giovani 2022 survey across Italy, France, Germany, and Spain, we analyze a sample of childless adults aged 25-34. We first model the determinants of self-fulfillment valuation of parenthood by postmaterialism and welfare expectations. Next, we estimate a moderated mediation model - through generalized structural equation modelling with nonparametric bootstrap - to decompose the direct and indirect pathways linking values, perceived support, and fertility intentions. Our analysis reveals that welfare support may strengthen fertility intentions when it aligns with postmaterialist values by enhancing the meaning of parenthood, while in the absence of support the appeal of childbearing erodes.

The Minorities’ Diminished Returns (MDRs) framework posits that marginalized groups derive weaker health returns from economic resources than majority populations. Extending this framework to a migration context, this study examines wealth- and debt–health gradients in Norway, comparing first-generation immigrants with native-born Norwegians, disaggregated by region of origin and reason for migration. Methods: Using full-population administrative data from Norway (2017) and Poisson regression models, we analyze 590,274 first-generation immigrants and 2,867,668 native-born individuals aged 27 and older. Gross wealth (real and financial assets) and debt are the main predictors, with physician-diagnosed morbidity as the outcome. Findings: Wealth is more strongly associated with better health among natives than immigrants, consistent with MDRs. Gradients are steepest at lower wealth levels, plateau at higher levels, and vary by subgroup. Higher debt often predicts lower morbidity, particularly among individuals with substantial debt, suggesting debt can function as a resource as well as a burden.

Many previous studies have demonstrated that the three forms of capital—social capital, economic capital, and human capital—contribute to various aspects of post-disaster recovery. However, it remains unclear whether these forms of capital are also linked to the recovery of industries and land use. Therefore, this study examined the effects of these three forms of capital on agricultural recovery. Agriculture is a key sector for achieving a sustainable society, and it is desirable that farmland continues to be properly utilized even after disasters. Clarifying the characteristics of regions where farmland is appropriately maintained after a disaster is thus essential for realizing sustainability. In this study, we employed satellite remote sensing and causal inference methods to investigate changes in paddy utilization in areas affected by the 2024 Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan. We then examined the relationships between fluctuations in paddy field use and village-level social, economic, and human capital. The results suggest that in severely affected areas, after controlling for other regional characteristics, social capital had a positive effect on agricultural resilience. By contrast, in areas with relatively minor disaster damage, economic capital had a positive effect, whereas human capital exhibited a negative effect. These findings imply that the effects of different forms of capital are not consistent, and that their impacts on agricultural resilience may vary depending on severity of the physical damage.

In this study, we integrate “measured accessibility” and “perceived accessibility” within a quality-of-life (QoL) framework to empirically determine what constitutes “sufficient” accessibility. Using community survey data from Austin, Texas, we combine a composite accessibility index—built from both primal (cumulative opportunity) and dual (minimum cost) measures across auto and transit modes—with self-reported QoL and perceived accessibility. We develop a sufficiency threshold by identifying the level of perceived accessibility associated with median QoL under different levels of measured accessibility. Our results indicate that perceived accessibility is a stronger predictor of QoL than measured access. A sufficiency threshold is derived using a normative regression-based approach, identifying the minimum perceived accessibility score required to reach the median QoL benchmark under typical access conditions. Logistic regression analyses further reveal that women, renters, long-term residents, and full-time workers are significantly less likely to report sufficient perceived accessibility—suggesting that social and structural barriers persist even in areas with good physical access.

Standard bioethical frameworks, often focused on principlism, inadequately address the complex intersubjective and systemic challenges posed by digital mediation. There is a need for an ethical framework that centers human dignity and recognition within technologically mediated care. Objective: This perspective paper develops and applies a critical ethical framework for telemedicine grounded in recognition theory, aiming to evaluate how digital systems can support or undermine the recognition of persons, especially in vulnerable contexts. Methods: We synthesize Axel Honneth's recognition theory with insights from relational ethics, phenomenology of illness, and critical disability studies to propose a tripartite framework comprising three interdependent dimensions of recognition: Ascertaining (epistemic recognition of the patient as an embodied knower), Acceptance (normative inclusion respecting vulnerability and difference), and Approval (institutional legitimation of telemedicine as genuine care). We conduct a critical conceptual analysis applying this framework to the Tuscany Health Ecosystem project, a telemedicine initiative in remote Italian regions. Findings: The application of the Ascertaining-Acceptance-Approval framework reveals both the potential of hybrid, community-integrated telemedicine models (like Tuscany's) to foster recognition through nurse-mediated presence and relational continuity, and significant unresolved tensions. These include persistent epistemic compromises, ambiguities in power-sharing and patient choice, undertheorized socioeconomic vulnerabilities, and structural contradictions between relational care demands and system pressures for efficiency (e.g., the efficiency-recognition dilemma, risk of technological solutionism). Conclusion: Recognition theory transforms telemedicine from a purely technical challenge into an ethical-political project. Ensuring digital healthcare humanizes rather than diminishes care requires moving beyond simple access metrics. It demands ethical vigilance focused on hybridity, perpetual reflexivity, and meaningful community participation to ensure technology supports recognition and resists deepening health inequities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8w9xk_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8w9xk_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005500230619378987}, {"title": "Adapting to Working from home as a Software Business Project Manager during the COVID-19 pandemic", "authors": "Magdalena Androulaki Korakaki", "abstract": "Working from home (WFH) was the only option of operation for many businesses and organisations during the COVID-19 pandemic where social distancing measures were introduced by governments worldwide.

These reductions are most substantial in the first five years of life with no evidence of a rebound after school entry. We also find some evidence these effects are higher for mothers aged 21 and younger. Due to study limitations, the magnitude of these effects are imprecisely measured and we suggest further avenues for future research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wz2qm_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wz2qm_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013670427725005374}]
