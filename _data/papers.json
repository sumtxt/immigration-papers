[{"title":"Can riots represent? A democratic theory","authors":"Alexis Bibeau‐Gagnon","abstract":"Political theory has been perennially concerned with interrogating, identifying, and clarifying the political functions of riots. Yet, political theorists have mostly fallen short of explaining the relationship between riots and democracy, although this is central to the democratic theory of contestation and crucial for evaluating the potential values of riots in democracy. I examine the question of riots and democracy through the lens of political representation. Using testimonies from rioters, I explore the disruptive, affirmative, and representational dimensions of riots. I contend that riots can be viewed as a form of political representation in which a self‐constituting subject puts forward claims to an audience on behalf of others and of themselves, showing that riots may sometimes represent a spontaneous and temporary collective subject speaking in the name of others. This underscores the democratic potential of riots to assert a presence that, while short‐lived, is central to the act of representing.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12989","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12989","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.3818,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Complementarity in alliances: How strategic compatibility and hierarchy promote efficient cooperation in international security","authors":"J. Andrés Gannon","abstract":"How can defense alliances reap the efficiency gains of working together when coordination and opportunism costs are high? Although specializing as part of a collective comes with economic and functional benefits, states must bargain over the distribution of those gains and ensure the costs of collective action are minimized. I argue that states can overcome these problems by forming alliances with high strategic compatibility and hierarchy. This approach minimizes opportunism and coordination costs by efficiently distributing defense capabilities, encouraging complementarity rather than redundancy. I demonstrate this by developing a novel network‐level measure of division of labor and applying it to data on national military capabilities from 1970 to 2014. This research not only enhances understanding of the modern international system but also underscores the importance of these considerations for intra‐alliance bargaining more broadly.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12992","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12992","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4123,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The political consequences of Africa's mobile revolution","authors":"Alex Yeandle","abstract":"What are the political consequences of rising domestic connectivity? I study this question in Sub‐Saharan Africa, asking how mobile technology shapes public opinion in geographically isolated communities. For remote rural populations, mobile devices increase contact with physically distant social networks, through regular phone calls with urban relatives. These interactions provide personalized information about the economic challenges of city life, which reduce rural trust in government. I offer continent‐wide evidence of this effect, leveraging geocoded survey data and the expansion of mobile coverage across Africa in a difference‐in‐differences setting. I then use a household panel, an original survey, and focus group discussions from Ghana to shed light on mechanisms. The paper advances literature on social networks, migration, and technological change, painting a nuanced picture of Africa's mobile revolution and its multifaceted political effects.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12991","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12991","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4835,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Decentralized propaganda in the era of digital media: The massive presence of the Chinese state on Douyin","authors":"Yingdan Lu, Jennifer Pan, Xu Xu, Yiqing Xu","abstract":"The rise of social media in the digital era poses unprecedented challenges to authoritarian regimes that aim to influence public attitudes and behaviors. To address these challenges, we argue that authoritarian regimes have adopted a decentralized approach to produce and disseminate propaganda on social media. In this model, tens of thousands of government workers and insiders are mobilized to produce and disseminate propaganda, and content flows in a multidirectional, rather than a top‐down manner. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this new model in China by creating a novel data set of over five million videos from over 18,000 regime‐affiliated accounts on Douyin, a popular social media platform in China. This paper supplements prevailing understandings of propaganda by showing theoretically and empirically how digital technologies are transforming not only the content of propaganda, but also how propaganda materials are produced and disseminated.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12990","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12990","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.3963,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Democratic Trajectories in the Third Wave: Aligning Theory and Methods","authors":"Aníbal Pérez-Liñán, Scott Mainwaring","abstract":"This paper advances the study of democratic trajectories – whether democracies deepen, stagnate, erode or break down over time. We show that econometric panel models usually neglect cumulative effects, which are implicitly central to many theories of democratic change. Some important factors, such as economic growth, have cumulative effects that shape medium- to long-term regime trajectories. To overcome the limitations of conventional statistical estimators, we propose the use of latent growth curve models, which are better able to capture cumulative processes. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach by analyzing the trajectory of 103 democratic regimes inaugurated after 1974.

The results show that the campaign promise increased alignment with the pledge-making party by 12.7% among eligible beneficiaries. The alignment effects are stronger among supporters who traditionally align with left-wing platforms and/or individuals with lower economic security. The promise had no mobilizing effect on inactive voters. Finally, we document that the promise effect is transitory as re-alignment among recipients disappears shortly after the pledge is fulfilled.

This study provides the first systematic test of this hypothesis in the comparative setting using an original seven country survey conducted in 2021–2022. The survey explored perceptions of immigrants’ membership commitment in the host society in seven liberal democracies and their effect on public support for the extension of social benefits to immigrants.

We examine this question using a unique dataset of votes on 1140 resolutions and amendments that explicitly target Russia in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) between 2007 and 2021. We argue that Putin’s portrayal of Russia as a defender of traditional family values against liberal egalitarianism, especially against LGBT rights, contributes to divisions between and within Europe’s parties. Consistent with this argument, we find that women and parliamentarians who express support for LGBT rights have become less likely to support Russia compared to other members of their national parties. However, this applies mostly to female MPs within culturally liberal parties and only becomes apparent after Putin’s culturally conservative turn. In addition, parties with more women in leadership become less likely to support Russia. We identify these effects using national party fixed effects and by matching on observables.

More than 500 Indigenous groups have experienced repression and attempts at erasure. Still, Indigenous communities persist and are politically active. We argue that structural and institutional factors within democracy do not fully explain Indigenous political engagement: they miss important dynamics within communities, where activism is often locally focused, rooted in community organizations, and focused on high-salience issues. Using the AmericasBarometer survey (17 countries, 2004–2019) we show that Indigenous people vote at equal levels to other citizens, and protest, contact government, join parties, campaign, and discuss politics more than non-Indigenous people. Variation in voting can be partially explained by Indigenous population size, but Indigenous people tend to participate at high levels in local and non-voting political activities regardless of population size. Associational participation is one mechanism that helps shape other diverse forms of Indigenous political action.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251328005","doi":"10.1177/00104140251328005","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.5379,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"‘They Take Our Healthcare’: Health and Attitudes towards Immigration in Europe","authors":"Gabor Scheiring, Anne-Marie Jeannet, David Stuckler","abstract":"In this study, we extend the research on anti-immigrant attitudes by analyzing an overlooked factor: health. We develop a framework explaining why residents perceive competition for health services with immigrants. Using data from eleven rounds of the European Social Survey, covering 222,989 respondents in 30 European countries (2002–2023), we find a consistent association between poor health and anti-immigration attitudes. Three pathways—the belief that immigrants drain public services, diminished interpersonal trust, and distrust in political institutions—mediate this effect. The association holds across four measures of ill health, with propensity score matching to reduce selection bias and extensive robustness tests. We conclude that health is crucial for attitudes about immigration not only because of welfare chauvinism and resource competition but also because bad health makes people lose faith in each other and the system, intensifying their fear of losing access to vital health services, translating into hostility toward immigrants.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251342932","doi":"10.1177/00104140251342932","journal_full":"Comparative Political Studies","dist":0.6574,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The impact of party appeals on age differences in voting","authors":"Laura Serra","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102942","doi":"10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102942","journal_full":"Electoral Studies","dist":0.4115,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The political effects of communicative interventions during crises","authors":"ASLI UNAN, HEIKE KLÜVER, SARA HOBOLT, TONI RODON","abstract":"Can communicative interventions by the government influence political trust and increase public compliance during crises?

Trade flows create competitive economic pressures that may undermine climate action, but these pressures may ebb when partners also commit to act. I argue that political networks support conditional cooperation, especially when institutional design promotes gradual commitments. I use spatial regression models to study how countries’ climate targets are related to their partners’ prior targets. I find that countries pledged stronger updated mitigation targets in the Glasgow Climate Pact when their closest political partners submitted strong targets in the Paris Agreement.

To test these arguments, I combine new monthly data on ethnic accommodation in 125 multi-ethnic electoral regimes between 1990 and 2018 with information on dominant group mobilization in anti-government protests and communal violence. I find systematic increases in dominant group mobilization around times when group-based accommodation is first introduced or expanded. These results enhance our understanding of mass mobilization by dominant ethnic groups. Moreover, they point to concrete proposals to reap the benefits of ethnic accommodation while avoiding a potentially destabilizing backlash against it.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00220027251343836","doi":"10.1177/00220027251343836","journal_full":"Journal of Conflict Resolution","dist":0.587,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Supporting reparations after armed conflict: How discursive ‘memory battles’ affect political solidarity with Guatemalan Indigenous survivors","authors":"Elke Evrard, Gretel Mejía Bonifazi","abstract":"Literature on survivor mobilization in transitional justice contexts has largely overlooked the relevance and dynamics of solidarity-based support by non-victimized groups. This article studies the relation between contentious processes of discursive ‘memory-making’ and public support for reparations in post-conflict Guatemala. Using a nationwide survey-embedded experiment with 300 respondents, we measure how contrasting representations of the temporality of harm and prospects for peace – drawn from elite versus survivor narratives – influence political solidarity with Indigenous survivors and support for their reparation demands. Findings show that while perceptions of survivors’ continued suffering and reparations’ peace-building potential are key predictors of solidarity and support, the contrasting narrative primes did not significantly influence these perceptions or resulting attitudes. The survey’s open-ended responses suggest that, in engaging with prevalent public discourses, respondents have developed relatively stable yet highly diverse interpretations of the necessity and ability of reparations to address social, psychological, and economic harms, and to promote beneficial outcomes for society at large. Mapping these responses onto the quantitative scores indicates that solidary support is more likely to emerge when non-victimized groups situate conflict-related harms within an ongoing history of structural violence and position reparations as building blocks for recognition, development and social integration – signalling the importance of discursive and expressive dynamics in public engagement with reparation processes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433241312069","doi":"10.1177/00223433241312069","journal_full":"Journal of Peace Research","dist":0.5131,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Accounting for variability in conflict dynamics: A pattern-based predictive model","authors":"Thomas Schincariol, Hannah Frank, Thomas Chadefaux","abstract":"Existing models for predicting conflict fatalities frequently produce conservative forecasts that gravitate towards the mean. While these approaches have a low average prediction error, they offer limited insights into temporal variations in conflict-related fatalities. Yet, accounting for variability is particularly relevant for policymakers, providing an indication on when to intervene. In this article, we introduce a novel risk-taking methodology, the ‘Shape finder’, designed to capture variability in fatality data, or rather the sudden surges and declines in the number of deaths over time. The method involves isolating historically analogous sequences of fatalities to create a reference repository. Comparing the shape of the input sequence to the historical references, the most similar historical cases are selected. Predictions are then generated using the average future outcomes of the selected matches. The Shape finder is derived from the theoretical understanding that strategic and adaptive interactions between the government and a non-state armed group produce recurring temporal patterns in fatality data, which are indicative of broader developments. In this article, we demonstrate that our approach maintains high accuracy while significantly enhancing the ability to predict shifts, surges, and declines in conflict fatalities over time. We show that combining the Shape finder with existing approaches, the Violence Early-Warning System ensemble, achieves a lower mean squared error and better accounts for variability in fatality data. The Shape finder methodology performs particularly well for high intensity cases, or rather country-months with substantial armed violence.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251330790","doi":"10.1177/00223433251330790","journal_full":"Journal of Peace Research","dist":0.4191,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Priority Projects: Constituent Spending Demand and the Benefits of Congressional Credit Claiming","authors":"Peter T.

Clarifying the connection between federal spending and congressional elections is critical for understanding the institution, as distributive benefits are theorized to enhance representation and facilitate broader policymaking. Extant studies argue that members of Congress use credit claiming for distributive benefits to cultivate an impression of influence, portraying themselves as uniquely capable of securing projects for their constituents. I develop a targeted theory of congressional distributive politics and argue that public support is granted to legislators for securing the right distributive benefits rather than securing the most distributive benefits. Using two survey experiments to explore constituent demand for different types of spending, I find robust evidence that legislators' ability to meet constituent demand shapes the effectiveness of their credit claims. I also find unexpected partisan convergence in the public's spending priorities and responsiveness to congressional credit claiming.

However, pundits often use terms like ’ideological disagreement’ to describe a broad range of phenomena, diverging from how the concept is understood in classical Conversian literature on beliefs and their structures. This literature suggests that individuals do not uniformly hold or organize their opinions. Building on this foundation, I argue for a critical distinction between disagreements among ideologues—who are opinionated and aligned in their beliefs—and disagreements among others. I hypothesize that disagreements among ideologues result in higher expected disagreement and greater mutual animosity. To test this hypothesis, I conducted two survey experiments with representative U.S. samples (N = 2,000 each, in January 2024 and May 2024). Using evaluations of hypothetical profiles of fellow citizens, I demonstrate that opinionatedness and ideological alignment of beliefs significantly reduce interpersonal affinity in contexts of disagreement. In the first study, disagreements with centrists elicit nearly four times less animosity than disagreements with opinionated counterparts. Furthermore, ideological alignment generates almost three times more intense feelings at equivalent levels of substantive (dis)agreement. In the second study, I find that ideologically aligned individuals anticipate higher levels of disagreement with one another compared to non-ideologues, when they observe the same level of disagreement as them. This effect is particularly pronounced among ideologues capable of recognizing ideological patterns in others’ beliefs. These findings highlight the role of opinionatedness and recognizable belief structures, offering a new approach that is generalizable to other divided democracies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11109-025-10049-z","doi":"10.1007/s11109-025-10049-z","journal_full":"Political Behavior","dist":0.5351,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Texas in the Rear-View Mirror?

Since 2016, the Democratic Party has failed to declare a party chair in about 20% of rural counties and did not field a candidate for Congress in nearly the same, while Republicans filled all but 4% of rural chairships and contested every rural seat. With broader data from Texas, we show even larger percentages of rural counties have uncontested State Senate and House seats.

The compensatory control theory articulates that people may turn to overarching social institutions or ideologies (e.g., conservatism) when they lack personal control. Inspired by this theory, the present research explored whether individuals experiencing personal climate response inefficacy are more likely to embrace political conservatism. Study 1 analyzed data from the European Social Survey ( N = 44,387) and provided preliminary evidence of a positive association between personal climate response inefficacy and political conservatism. Study 2 utilized four‐wave longitudinal data from 1008 American participants and identified a consistent within‐person cross‐lagged effect, where personal climate response inefficacy predicted increased political conservatism over time. Both studies ruled out the potential conflating effect of the perceived threat of climate change.

Despite increased academic attention, the understanding of participants' experiences remains limited. This paper argues for adopting an actor‐centered perspective to gain novel insights into protest dynamics. Specifically, we focus on the everyday dilemmas of protest participation. We present the Catalan pro‐independence protest cycle (2012–2020) as an instrumental case illustrating lay participants' engagement in mass demonstrations. Drawing on 30 open‐ended interviews with ordinary actors, we conducted a discursive and rhetorical analysis. Our results show that, when faced with dilemmatic experiences, ordinary participants adopt various discursive strategies that allow them to both engage with and distance themselves from (part of) the movement's collective identity. Four main patterns were identified: avoiding identification with independentism, rejecting the stigmatized characterization of pro‐independence participants, framing participation as non‐political, and engaging in heterodox participation. Finally, we discuss the role of dilemmas in protest involvement.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70042","doi":"10.1111/pops.70042","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.5031,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The gradual decline of colonial ideologies (2009–2018): A latent growth curve analysis of historical negation and symbolic exclusion among settler colonizers","authors":"Zoe Bertenshaw, Chris G. Sibley, Danny Osborne","abstract":"In nations laden with colonial inequities, settler colonizers protect their structural advantages through ideologies that (a) distance the injustices of colonization from contemporary society (historical negation) and (b) exclude Indigenous culture from the mainstream national identity (symbolic exclusion). Here, we track settler colonizers' endorsement of these two ideologies between 2009 and 2018 among a nationwide random sample of Pākehā/New Zealand Europeans ( N = 22,986). Consistent with global trends toward equality over this period, both historical negation and symbolic exclusion exhibited a gradual, though slightly accelerating, decline. Subsequent analyses indicate that mean levels of both ideologies were higher among men (vs. women), correlated positively with age, conservatism, social dominance orientation, and right‐wing authoritarianism, and correlated negatively with warmth toward Māori. Additionally, the decline in historical negation was attenuated among men and by age, conservatism, and social dominance orientation, whereas the decline in symbolic exclusion was attenuated by age and warmth toward Māori, but accelerated by social dominance orientation. Results thus illustrate a progressive trajectory of ideological change among settler colonizers during the 2009–2018 period and identify factors that impede one's willingness to renounce ideologies that uphold colonial inequities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70041","doi":"10.1111/pops.70041","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.54,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The urban–rural divide in policy priorities across time and space","authors":"Tevfik Murat Yildirim, Knut M.

This study explores urban–rural differences in policy priorities over an extended period (1939–2020), using data from 850 U.S. surveys. The analysis reveals modest but persistent gaps between urban and rural residents in several key policy areas. However, while urban–rural differences remain stable across diverse economic and political contexts, partisan affiliation significantly outweighs place-based identities in shaping these priorities. The findings suggest that despite geographic distinctions, urban and rural populations predominantly rely on partisan cues when forming policy agendas, which contributes to a nuanced understanding of political representation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.33","doi":"10.1017/psrm.2025.33","journal_full":"Political Science Research and Methods","dist":0.5136,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"“My Own Private Idaho”: A Survey of Separatist Attitudes in the Pacific Northwest","authors":"Semir Dzebo, Erin K.

Lupton, Jeremy M.

These claims rested on assumptions that military bases and their surrounding communities are strongholds for political conservativism––a belief held by scholars, pundits, and politicians alike. While the logic behind these arguments is appealing, it fails to consider the complexities surrounding military service and institutions, political geography, partisan preferences, and voting behavior. We directly test the notion that communities close to military bases will be and vote more Republican. Using three different but related empirical strategies that rely on a large dataset spanning 16 years, we find evidence contradicting the conventional wisdom. No consistent pattern across military installations exists. While some lean Republican, others lean Democratic, and the vast majority exhibit no party pattern at all.

While there is a vast literature on the public’s support for new military interventions and its approval of interventions that are underway, there is very little research on public opinion around the explicit question of ending a military campaign on foreign soil and “going home.” This is surprising, given the salience of questions about terminating military interventions in contemporary world politics, from Afghanistan to Ukraine and beyond. In this research note, we argue that the public’s expressed appetite for exiting from an intervention is influenced in crucial ways by framing choices made by public opinion pollsters. In particular, we contend that whether pollsters frame withdrawal as an enemy victory or not and the alternate response options they provide around it can strongly impact its appeal. To test these ideas, we pair an observational analysis of public opinion polls over time on American support for military withdrawals from 1946 to 2021 with an original survey experiment conducted about the 2021 NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan. The results reveal that both the enemy victory frame and what we call the middle ground frame exert a powerful influence on public support for withdrawal, and do so across people with different partisan and foreign policy predispositions. These results help provide insight into when people support going home in war, while also extending the considerable literature on framing choices in opinion polling in new ways.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf020","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf020","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4868,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Worlds Apart? Public Agenda Fragmentation in Sweden 1987–2021","authors":"Per Oleskog Tryggvason, Adam Shehata, Judith Möller","abstract":"Claims concerning media fragmentation and political polarization permeate discussions about our changing democratic public sphere. As traditional mass media lose ground and people increasingly construct their own personal information environments, citizens may develop highly contrasting perceptions of politics and society—potentially undermining the common ground needed for rational public discourse. Two widely discussed expressions of these developments are the fragmentation and polarization of the public agenda. At the same time, these concerns largely originate from developments in the United States. Whether polarization and fragmentation of the public agenda also characterize other Western democracies with less fragmented media systems remains unclear. This study therefore analyzes longitudinal survey data from Sweden. Covering a period of thirty-five years (1987–2021), the findings reveal that (1) the public agenda has indeed fragmented and diversified over time, (2) citizens not interested in politics are increasingly dropping out from the shared public agenda, but (3) public service media counter this dropout trend, and (4) for a number of issues, the public agenda has become more polarized along ideological lines.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfae065","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfae065","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4997,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"In-Party Love, Out-Party Hate, and Affective Polarization in Twelve Established Democracies","authors":"Diego Garzia, Frederico Ferreira da Silva","abstract":"Recent research has mapped levels of affective polarization worldwide.

The analysis expands previous descriptive accounts of levels of in- and out-party affect, reports levels of in-party love and out-party hate, and inspects longitudinal changes in the polarity of affect with a composite measure tapping the relative weight of in- and out-party feelings. The findings show a generalized decline of out-party evaluations and a growing prevalence of out-party hate versus in-party love over time. While citizens may not be more polarized than before in most Western democracies, contemporary affective polarization is more heavily characterized by a disproportionate weight of out-group dislike.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf013","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf013","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5623,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Race in a Pandemic: Asian American Perceptions of Discrimination and Political Preferences in the 2020 Election","authors":"Vivien Leung, Natalie Masuoka","abstract":"Are individual perceptions about racial discrimination relatively stable or are they influenced by external cues? Does belief stability on racial discrimination items offer some explanation for the inconsistent findings on the relationship between perceptions about discrimination and political behavior for racial minorities identified in the past literature? This study highlights the case of Asian Americans and the rise of anti-Asian hate during the COVID pandemic as an opportunity to understand how Asian Americans report discrimination against their group in response to surrounding events. Using an original three-wave study of Asian American respondents collected over 2020, we find that perceptions of discrimination were relatively stable over 2020. At the same time, we find that a respondent’s preexisting attitudes about racial discrimination held prior to the pandemic informed their assessment of discrimination during the pandemic. We also find that a respondent’s preexisting discrimination beliefs moderate the relationship between their assessment about discrimination during the pandemic and 2020 presidential candidate choice.

We argue that this discrepancy arises because some researchers measure Japanese voters’ first-order preferences (who they personally support) while other researchers measure Japanese voters’ second-order preferences (who they expect other voters to support). We call this gap between voters’ own preferences and expectations regarding others’ preferences the preference-expectation gap. Since this gap is a key mechanism of strategic discrimination, we test our argument using an experimental design modelled after research on strategic discrimination in the 2020 US Democratic primary elections. Based on two online conjoint survey experiments in Japan, our findings demonstrate the presence of a preference-expectation gap in Japanese public opinion on female politicians. Exploratory analyses of moderation effects reveal that female participants and those with more liberal views toward gender roles have larger preference-expectation gaps.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf002","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf002","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4806,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Catch Questions Can Increase Lookups on Political Knowledge Questions","authors":"Matthew H Graham","abstract":"Surveys commonly use “catch” or “trap” questions to identify subjects who are likely to look up the answers to knowledge questions. This note shows that catch questions can backfire, causing an increase in the proportion of respondents who look up the answers to subsequent questions. In two preregistered survey experiments in online convenience samples, a catch question was randomly assigned to appear before or after a knowledge battery. When the catch question appeared first, window switching on the knowledge questions was about 25 percent more common. This suggests that when they are used, catch questions should be placed at the end of knowledge batteries, and should also not precede later items that could be affected by lookups. More generally, the results highlight the importance of pre-testing catch and trap questions for unintended consequences.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf015","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf015","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.4093,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Partisan Influence on Policy Preferences in Retrenching the Welfare State","authors":"Miroslav Nemčok, Hanna Wass, Juho Vesa","abstract":"While citizens typically favor welfare policies, the electoral consequences of retrenching the welfare state are often minimal for parties implementing the reforms. Using two structural reforms in Finland as a natural quasi-experiment, we show that voters’ policy preferences shift in response to welfare reform measures initiated by their preferred parties. In December 2020, the Finnish center-left government enacted two reforms: one reducing social protection by removing entitlements for laid-off older workers to receive income-based unemployment benefits, and the other increasing social spending by extending the compulsory education age from 16 to 18. Using a two-wave panel survey conducted before and after the government actions, the results indicate that government voters became considerably more supportive of both reforms, despite their initial low support for welfare retrenchment and its contradiction with the established ideological profile of their parties. Moreover, the shift in voters’ policy preferences was substantively greater compared to their opposition counterparts and not affected by ideology and economic self-interest. Hence, voters’ policy preferences show dynamic adaptability to match the party line, thereby reducing grounds for holding the parties accountable.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf017","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf017","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5063,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Descriptive representation and attitudes about local government: An experimental test using real-world stimuli","authors":"David Doherty, Madeline Schade, Dana Garbarski","abstract":"Does descriptive representation lead people to evaluate elected officials and their institutions more favorably?

Our pre-registered design positions us to identify effects of roughly one-eighth of a standard deviation in our full sample, but the estimated effects of signals of ethnoracial- and gender-based descriptive representation are null across the five outcomes we consider. In pre-registered exploratory analysis re-estimating effects by subgroup, we find evidence that suggests that descriptive representation affects some attitudes among women and Black respondents.

Here we provide a series of validation tests of the sort of cross-national time-series latent variable measures employed in recent research by reference to questions on support for liberal democracy and opposition to its erosion from multi-wave surveys conducted around the world. These tests show that, across countries and years, this latent variable is nearly orthogonal to measures of support for contestation and participation; civil liberties; institutional constraints on executive power; and prioritizing democracy over the economy, economic equality, or order. We conclude that support for democracy in any robust sense is simply not well captured by one-dimensional latent variable. Such measures are powerful but researchers must be mindful of their limitations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251341857","doi":"10.1177/20531680251341857","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.4535,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Who Benefits?

Findings indicate that personal stories shared and amplified through these digital platforms resonate with the imagined community, forming emotional connections that transcend geographic and socioeconomic boundaries. We identify key actors—storytellers, beneficiaries, public institutions, and the globally dispersed imagined community—and explore how their interactions enhance community well-being. This exploration highlights the crucial role that storytelling through social media plays in mobilizing support and fostering social connections.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251345363","doi":"10.1177/20563051251345363","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4525,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Under the Shadow of Uncertainty: A Longitudinal Study Tracing the Pathway From Future Uncertainty to Psychological Distress Through Social Media Addiction and Emotional Exhaustion","authors":"Jingwen Liang, Xiao Zhang, Dennis Ka Kuen Leung, Louis Leung","abstract":"Using two-wave panel survey data collected 12 months apart from a random sample of 447 Hong Kong respondents, this study builds upon the stress–strain–outcome model to examine the relationships among future uncertainty stress, social media addiction, emotional exhaustion, and psychological distress.

Masur, Carsten Wilhelm","abstract":"This editorial introduces the Social Media + Society special issue “Comparative Approaches To Studying Privacy.” Recognizing the importance of privacy in today’s digital societies and volatile political and regulatory environments, the editorial highlights the pressing need for comparative research on the topic and describes the articles in this special issue. The special issue addresses the theoretical, methodological, and practical challenges and opportunities of researching privacy across cultural, social, political, economic, and technological units of comparison. The articles in the special issue explore diverse privacy understandings, attitudes, and practices across contexts, challenging decontextualized and mono-cultural understandings in relation to social media and adjacent technologies. The special issue articles also illustrate fruitful ways privacy can be studied across different units of comparison with qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods. Several contributions in the special issue, including this editorial, not only broaden the scope of privacy research but also encourage engagement with multi-stakeholder perspectives in the context of social media, considering the role of policy, industry, and civil society. In the editorial, we briefly relate the special issue and its contributions to the comparative privacy research framework (CPRF), which serves as a useful starting point and a solid conceptual foundation for comparative privacy research. Finally, we develop a research agenda for future comparative privacy research, which critically examines position of power and epistemological biases, evaluates the comparability of the subject of study, determining and justifying relevant units of comparison, and helps to analyze how these units interact in shaping the concept of privacy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251344460","doi":"10.1177/20563051251344460","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4414,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Local Activism Goes Digital in Authoritarian Setting: The Use of Digital Platforms in Place-Based Conflicts in Russia","authors":"Vsevolod Bederson, Liubov Chernysheva, Andrei Semenov","abstract":"Grassroots activism constitutes the backbone of civil society across political regimes. While many studies explored the role of social media and digital platforms in social movements, we focus on the ways local activists use these social media platforms to organize collectively against unwanted urban development. Localized (place-based) contention differs from large-scale social movements: it is less endowed with resources and it is directly related to physical space. We analyze 26 urban conflicts in six Russian cities based on 185 interviews with activists and experts to show how the residents leverage digital platforms’ affordances and argue that the former extensively rely on the latter for coordination, communication, and recruitment purposes. Yet, the nature of place-based conflicts makes blending online and offline organizational activities inevitable. We also demonstrate that despite their benefits, digital platforms also bring organizational challenges. The authoritarian state imposes further constraints, requiring activists to take into account state surveillance and repression in their engagement with social media. Our study contributes to the scholarship on digitally mediated actions, urging a reevaluation of social media’s role in local collective actions.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251344455","doi":"10.1177/20563051251344455","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4496,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The New Experts of Online Dating: Feminism, Advice, and Harm on Instagram","authors":"Joanna Large, Natasha Mulvihill","abstract":"Situated within the theoretical work of Giddens and others on the role of expertise in contemporary society, this article evaluates the Instagram accounts of six dating-themed influencers.

A Framework of Affordances for Understanding Civil Society Accountability on Social Media Platforms","authors":"Cecilia Gullberg, Nils Gustafsson","abstract":"This article investigates how social media can enable and constrain civil society organizations’ (CSOs) discharge of accountability. Based on a comparative analysis of the Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter (X) posts of the Swedish Red Cross during 1 year ( N = 1014), we propose a framework of affordances that illustrate how platform features, practices, norms, and perceptions about audiences jointly shape the accountability potential of a platform. Accountability is overall more content- than process-oriented, emphasizing visibility of action rather than far-reaching social interactivity. Our study, however, reveals important differences between Instagram and Facebook, on the one hand, and Twitter, on the other. Whereas accountability is more short-term, scripted, and donor-oriented in the former, it is more abstract and ad hoc, with mainly indirect efforts at interactivity, in the latter. Our framework of affordances sheds light on the hitherto under-researched intersection between the literature on CSO accountability and the literature on CSO use of social media.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251340146","doi":"10.1177/20563051251340146","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.3858,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Turtle, Water, and Silicon: Storyworking Indigenous Digital Methodologies","authors":"Cindy Tekobbe","abstract":"The author of this article contends that current digital research methodologies tend to extract and commodify knowledge in ways that can replicate social, cultural, racial, economic, and global inequities.

Dissecting the Interplay Between Civil Society Organizing and Social Media Platforms","authors":"Alice Mattoni, Julie Uldam, Noomi Weinryb","abstract":"A few social media platforms have come to play a central role in civil society organizing, often functioning as organizing partners. But on whose terms? As organizing partners, commercial social media platforms shape the conditions under which civil society actors organize, also shaping organizational dynamics, visibility, and collective action. Far from being neutral partners, these platforms become battlegrounds where civil society actors and platform owners negotiate power, visibility, and control—differently affecting various forms of civil society actors and organizing. Therefore, we need to move beyond the notion of platforms as mere organizing agents to critically examine the opportunities and constraints they create for different civil society actors, as well as how different civil society actors navigate these. This requires considering both exogenous, contextual elements, and endogenous, actor-centered elements of civil society organizing. Doing so allows us to examine how organizing efforts emerge not simply on social media platforms but with them, requiring constant negotiation with platform logics. The collection of articles in this special issue shows how social media platforms enable civil society organizing, but also how platform-driven asymmetries emerge and play out differently according to the different features that characterize the civil society organizations at stake.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251343865","doi":"10.1177/20563051251343865","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.3748,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Establishment of mobile money corridors and Burkina Faso's intra-WAEMU trade","authors":"Lamoussa Seydou Lankoande","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103000","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103000","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.2366,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Factors driving mobile network operator profitability in public safety mobile broadband projects","authors":"Tapio Savunen, Juuso Töyli, Pekka Kekolahti, Petri Mähönen","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102995","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102995","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.226,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Gender-Specific Application Behaviour, Matching, and the Residual Gender Earnings Gap","authors":"Benjamin Lochner, Christian Merkl","abstract":"This paper examines how gender-specific application behaviour, firms’ hiring practices, and flexibility demands relate to the gender earnings gap, using linked data from the German Job Vacancy Survey and administrative records.

Although long-run estimates are noisy, point estimates indicate that these productivity effects are sustained six years after the grants. We explore possible mechanisms for this finding, and show that treatment tilts the asset composition towards durables with a higher technology component: a result consistent with a important role for capital-embodied technology. Mediation analysis confirms that virtually all of the effect of treatment on productivity can be explained by the adoption of higher-technology durables.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf042","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf042","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.3626,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Inflation and price flexibility","authors":"Ivan Petrella, Emiliano Santoro, Yannik Winkelmann","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105056","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105056","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.2591,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Running the risk: Immunity and mobility in response to a pandemic","authors":"Claudio Deiana, Andrea Geraci, Giovanni Mastrobuoni, Simon Weidenholzer","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105057","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105057","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.4381,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"IMF Programs and Borrowing Costs Does Size Matter?","authors":"Salim Chahine, Ugo Panizza, Guilherme Suedekum","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105070","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105070","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.2996,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Labor market institutions, productivity, and the business cycle: An application to Italy","authors":"Josué Diwambuena, Raquel Fonseca, Stefan Schubert","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105048","doi":"10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105048","journal_full":"European Economic Review","dist":0.4445,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"On changepoint detection in functional data using empirical energy distance","authors":"B.

We first analyse the consequences of the subsidies on reducing the digital divide between urban and rural areas. Second, and more novel, we examine the impact on different measures of competition: market entry and the resulting effect on prices and broadband offerings. We use an instrumental variables (IV) approach based on the interaction between technical features of the programme and political cycles in order to exploit plausibly exogenous variation in the allocation of subsidies. We find that the subsidies significantly increased broadband coverage. More interestingly, the number of internet service providers (ISPs) increased significantly in municipalities that received subsidies, which, in turn, led to a relative increase in the number of local broadband plans and a relative decrease in average prices.

When economic conditions are poor, some firms might decide not to operate, thereby severing the links with their neighbors and changing the structure of the production network. Since producers benefit from having access to additional suppliers, nearby firms tend to operate, or not, together. As a result, the production network features clusters of operating firms, and the exit of a producer can create a cascade of firm shutdowns. While well-connected firms are better able to withstand shocks, they trigger larger cascades upon exit. The theory also predicts how the structure of the production network changes over the business cycle. As in the data, recessions are associated with more dispersed networks that feature fewer highly connected firms. In the calibrated economy, the endogenous reorganization of the network substantially dampens the impact of idiosyncratic shocks on aggregate fluctuations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf036","doi":"10.1093/restud/rdaf036","journal_full":"The Review of Economic Studies","dist":0.4098,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Efficient Conservation of the Brazilian Amazon: Estimates from a Dynamic Model","authors":"Rafael Araujo, Francisco Costa, Marcelo Sant’Anna","abstract":"This paper estimates the Brazilian Amazon’s carbon-efficient forest cover—i.e. when farmers internalize the social cost of carbon.

While considerable research has covered international migration, the understanding of how internal and international migration in Ukraine are interconnected is under-researched. The paper aims to situate the urban dimension at the core of the analysis to discuss the patterns of internal and external mobilities and their interrelatedness in pre- 2022 Ukraine. Drawing upon a recent turn in migration studies towards agency, aspirations, capabilities and decision-making, our research explores the perspectives of individuals who moved to Kyiv from other parts of the country and their future migration scenarios. Based on the fieldwork conducted in Kyiv and in its suburbs, we reveal the fluidity and complexity of migration experience and decision-making as well as the influence of interlinked factors—economic, political, social, and cultural—on mobility strategies. We demonstrate that the city plays a crucial role for migrants aspirations, capabilities and agency in decision making about further (im)mobility although in a nondeterministic way. The paper identifies four main patterns of decision-making processes among the Ukrainian internal migrants who moved to Kyiv: (1) planning to return to their places of origin, (2) considering migration within the country or abroad, (3) deciding to stay in the city and the country, (4) remaining ‘undecided.’ Furthermore, we argue that the strong emphasis on intentions to stay in Ukraine, evident during our fieldwork, has significant implications for migration patterns. This is crucial for comprehending the significant return migration of forced migrants to Ukraine during the war.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00442-2","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00442-2","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5748,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Renegotiating hope when stuck in Limboland: aspirations of Sub-Saharan African migrants in the urban context of Morocco","authors":"Vince Yalçin","abstract":"Earlier approaches to migration have largely focused on structural causes to explain why migrants move while overlooking the significance of their ability to enact agency. Yet, notions of (im)mobility, circularity and urbanity as fluid, dynamic processes of individual and collective experience, prompt an analysis of migration decision-making which emphasises migrants’ ability to actively negotiate their experienced inequalities and constraints. This paper explores how urban context impacts migrants’ decision-making processes through an analysis of their aspirations and capabilities while integrating perspectives on their ability to choose from a range of possibly (un)acceptable and/or (un)attainable alternatives, offering a more meaningful understanding of the agentic roles of migrants. Drawing from fieldwork with Sub-Saharan African migrants in urban centres in Morocco – Tangier, Rabat, Casablanca, Fes, and Nador – the findings suggest an inherent interlinkage between the aspirations-capabilities framework and the presence of alternatives within specific socio-urban contexts. The evidence shows the multiple alternatives at stake. Their examination suggests that (un)attainable and/or (un)acceptable alternatives deriving from one’s context may impact migrants’ aspirations and capabilities through various mediums, thus affecting their migration decision-making and (im)mobility patterns. When the urban context offered sufficient conditions to meet aspirations, the effects of alternatives were reduced, while precariousness accentuated the alternatives, making them integral to one’s decisions. Herein, the tangible aspirations-capabilities and alternatives nexus offers a window into the mediums of agency that impact migration decision-making processes.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00452-0","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00452-0","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5846,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"We’ll see things they’ll never see: love, hope, and neurodiversity","authors":"Siobhan O’Neill","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2501132","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2501132","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.2211,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The politics of intersectional practice: representation, coalition, and solidarity in UK NGOs","authors":"Lukas Bullock","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2510432","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2510432","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.4125,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Nationalism: a world history","authors":"Cenk Saraçoğlu","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2508398","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2508398","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.2968,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Forced Migrants’ Agency in a Life Course Approach—A Conceptual Proposal and Empirical Illustration","authors":"Ludger Pries","abstract":"Forced migrants live and act under extremely restricted conditions, nevertheless they make their own living.

However, it is unclear whether having the same province of origin can also lead to similar migratory paths. This study investigates the question of whether a shared home province among Filipina migrant domestic workers in Hong Kong is associated with shared or linked migration paths to Hong Kong. Using a unique data source, the 2017 Survey of Migrant Domestic Workers in Hong Kong, we employed sequence analysis to identify which specific provinces exhibit stronger linkages between migratory trajectories among migrants from the same provinces and if so, whether certain provincial characteristics matter. The study found that provinces with a lower population density and a greater number of cities tend to have a higher degree of shared migration paths among women from the same provinces. More importantly, the analysis provides convincing evidence that the presence of a hometown/home province association makes it more likely for migrant domestic workers to share similar migration pathways to Hong Kong. Furthermore, provinces with direct, one-step migration paths show a higher degree of linkage compared to those with multinational migration paths with multiple intermediate destinations. These findings provide insights into the provincial factors influencing linked migratory life courses among Filipina migrant domestic workers. The research contributes to a better understanding of the dynamics of migration and the interconnectedness of domestic workers’ migration paths.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251343887","doi":"10.1177/01979183251343887","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5268,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"The governmentalisation of personal digital archives in asylum procedures","authors":"Ivan Josipovic","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/1369183x.2025.2492350","doi":"10.1080/1369183x.2025.2492350","journal_full":"Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies","dist":0.4349,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"US Attorney Declination Rates of Tribal Cases: Resources Matter!","authors":"Regina Branton","abstract":"This study examines the factors that influence the use of declination powers by U.S. Attorney Offices (USAO) in Indian Country (IC) cases.

Additionally, migration motives and patterns vary by migration type and field of study, supporting a functional differentiation between internal and international mobility.

At the socioeconomic level, as revealed by our application of social network analysis to the numismatic data, the growth dynamics continued, leading to ever greater integration. When international conflict in the seventh c. CE disrupted the connectivity, the anthropogenic landscapes rewilded.

Research indicates that the decision to corporatize is driven, among other factors, by the pursuit of financial sustainability in public organizations. A continuing debate revolves around whether the political ideology of incumbents is linked to the creation of SOEs. However, limited attention has been given to understanding if incumbents’ ideology shapes SOEs’ financial performance and, hence, financial sustainability. This is concerning because SOEs operate beyond political cycles, facing pressures from ideologically different governments over time. Herein, we investigate whether the incumbents’ ideologies shape SOEs’ financial performance. We hypothesize that the more right leaning the incumbent, the greater the SOEs’ financial performance. However, given that incumbents’ decisions are influenced by their political parties’ behaviors, the effects of ideology may be contingent on these factors. Thus, we investigate whether the association of incumbents’ ideology with SOEs’ financial performance is weaker when incumbents’ political parties display non-policy behaviors (e.g., by prioritizing electoral outcomes or office occupation). We analyze a 2019–2022 panel of 317 SOEs controlled by 27 subnational governments in Brazil with both FGLS and instrumental variable regression approaches. The data comprising 1,116 SOE-year observations confirm our hypotheses. Our research contributes to scholarship on the drivers of public organizations’ financial performance and sheds light on the role of political contingencies, such as incumbents’ ideology and party predominant behaviors regarding SOEs’ financial performance—a commonly overlooked gap in current research.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf014","doi":"10.1093/jopart/muaf014","journal_full":"Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory","dist":0.4153,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Factors facilitating the adoption of wellbeing budgets in New Zealand: a case study with budget actors","authors":"Stephanie Ortynsky, Marwa Farag, Haizhen Mou","abstract":"New Zealand made international waves when it implemented a wellbeing budget in 2019.

We analyze the transposition of six fiscal treaty rules in France, Germany, and Italy ( N = 18) using fuzzy‐set Qualitative Comparative Analysis. Literal compliance results from high policy fit and the need to signal responsiveness to external pressures from the EU and financial markets. Even though it may appear unlikely, literal compliance with EU fiscal policy does occur when uniformity is both easier and more important than diversity for member states.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70025","doi":"10.1111/rego.70025","journal_full":"Regulation & Governance","dist":0.43,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Is That a Threat? How Types of Stakeholder and Reputational Threat Matter for Gaining Influence in Regulatory Rulemaking","authors":"Rik Joosen","abstract":"This paper assesses what type of comments are most useful to what type of stakeholder in gaining influence during public consultations. Theoretically, the paper approaches stakeholders' consultation comments as reputational threats from key audiences that the agency needs to respond to. Different types of threats are expected to carry different weights depending on the type of stakeholders. The analysis is based on a dataset of 73,283 consultation comments left by stakeholders in EASA rulemaking consultations. The findings indicate that it matters what interests pose what kind of threat in regulatory rulemaking. Certain group types become more influential while others lose out when making specific kinds of threats. This extends our understanding of how stakeholders gain influence and what reputational threats are seen as credible by regulatory agencies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70027","doi":"10.1111/rego.70027","journal_full":"Regulation & Governance","dist":0.453,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Resilience of New Public Management.

Chinese Agribusinesses and the Challenge of Compliance in Rural Tajikistan","authors":"Irna Hofman","abstract":"Chinese investments in Tajikistan have significantly increased since the early 2010s. In rural Tajikistan, Chinese companies make up the majority of foreign investors. However, Tajikistan's rural landscape is no easy terrain for foreigners. It is characterized by legal complexity, namely weak regulatory capacity, as well various elites' unofficial requirements. What does compliance mean in such a setting, and how do Chinese companies navigate this environment? Engaging with the literature on compliance and legal geography scholarship, this article examines these questions through the lens of a Chinese agribusiness operating in Tajikistan's cotton economy. I focus on environmental law and the governance of cotton procurement and illuminate a stark contrast: compliance with state law can be claimed relatively easily, but also questioned. On the contrary, compliance with elites' informal requirements is indispensable and requires adaptation. In this context, Chinese companies adjust and comply with laws and norms in locally specific ways.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70012","doi":"10.1111/rego.70012","journal_full":"Regulation & Governance","dist":0.4031,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Governance of the European Digital Identity Framework Through the Lens of Institutional Mimesis","authors":"Linda Weigl, Marta Reysner","abstract":"The European Commission's decision to expand its 2014 Regulation on electronic identification and trust services toward wallet‐based digital identities marked a significant shift in the governance of users' digital identities.

Housing arrangements and residential mobility among families with children","authors":"Warren Lowell","abstract":"A growing proportion of children live in unaffordable, overcrowded, or doubled-up housing, raising concerns among scholars of child wellbeing. These arrangements may affect children through increased exposure to insecure mobility such as frequent or reactive moves. Though scholars consider resource-strained arrangements insecure, the assumption that they lead to insecure mobility is quantitatively untested. Further, demographic theory suggests that these arrangements would lead to purposive moves, which are calculated adjustments to things like costs, space, or independence that have plausibly neutral or beneficial effects for children. I use individual-fixed effects regressions and restricted-access residential histories from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to assess how living in resource-strained housing predicts exposure to mobility outcomes for children. Consistent with literature on housing insecurity, severe cost burdens and doubling up with non-kin predict higher probabilities of either frequent or reactive moves, and severe overcrowding precedes moves to high-poverty neighborhoods. Aligned with a traditional view on mobility, analyses also suggest that cost burdens, overcrowding, and doubling up lead to purposive moves to less expensive housing, more spacious housing, and more independent housing arrangements, respectively. Together, these findings suggest that housing strains, in the absence of poverty, increase the likelihood of a set of moves that have generally ambivalent implications for children’s life chances. However, families in poverty may lack the resources necessary to make moves that address their housing needs and aspirations. These findings contradict long-held rules of thumb, suggesting a reconsideration of how we collectively define, study, and respond to insecurity.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf062","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf062","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.5093,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"What Lies between the Poles? Selective Uncertainty and Occluded Bias in Immigration Attitudes in California","authors":"G Cristina Mora, Chelsea Daniels, Tianna Paschel","abstract":"Although much extreme discourse is found at the poles, we still know little about how individuals in the center make sense of immigration as “complicated” and even “too complex” to make sense of. Such issues are important to address if we are to better understand the contemporary landscape of bias and belonging and the character of attitudes in the middle. We examine the issue by drawing on a unique survey of Californians and illustrative, linked, in-depth interviews. Using latent class analysis we identify five distinct attitudinal classes, showing that three, constituting 40 percent of respondents, lie between consistently pro- and anti-immigrant stances. Our interviews reveal that rather than expressing undifferentiated views, those in the middle express patterned forms of selective uncertainty that, in turn, allow them to frame the issue differently. At an ideological level, selective uncertainty helps individuals to narrow the scope of immigration in terms of what is determinable, and thus rationalize political commitments with outgroup bias toward the undocumented. At a discursive level, selective uncertainty affords an opportunity to soften or occlude bias and create a distance from the poles, especially on the right. Taken together, our findings open up the “black-boxed” middle of immigration attitudes to reveal its distinct categorical characteristics and show how selective uncertainty allows individuals to make sense of their positions. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of our findings, including for understanding immigration attitudes as a field of positions more generally.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf059","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf059","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.6555,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Tainted leave: a survey-experimental investigation of flexibility stigma in Japanese workplaces","authors":"Hilary J Holbrow","abstract":"Scholars posit that the flexibility stigma—a belief that workers who use flexible workplace policies, such as parental and sick leave—exacerbates gender inequality. However, a large body of research argues that the smaller number of men who take leaves face even more severe stigma than women because they violate norms of masculinity as well as the employers’ expectation that employees prioritize paid work. Empirical evidence in support of this claim comes largely from studies that estimate stigma using proxy measures such as leave uptake rates and pay inequality for leave takers. This study tests the gender deviance perspective more directly using survey experimental methods, in a setting where we would expect stigmatization of male leave takers to be particularly high—among workers in four elite firms in Japan. Drawing on data from over 8,000 employees, the results reveal that, even where the male breadwinner ideology is deeply entrenched, men’s leaves are no more stigmatized than women’s. To the contrary, there are no gender differences in stigmatization of sick leave, and women who take parental leave face more severe stigmatization than men. The results undercut claims that men face greater stigma when they take similar leaves as women, demonstrate the fallibility of proxy measures of stigma, and highlight how, in large Japanese firms, women remain doubly disadvantaged by the flexibility stigma.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf063","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf063","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.4951,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Life course illegality: how the life course and aging shape the experience of illegality","authors":"Isabel García Valdivia","abstract":"Scholars have studied in detail how immigrants experience illegality in the US.

Their findings center on children, young adults, and working-age adults, ignoring the fastest-growing population of undocumented immigrants, those over 50. This article uses a life course approach to examine how the fear of deportation shifts in late adulthood and introduces a new conceptual model, life course illegality (LCI), to understand the change. First, this LCI model bridges past research on migrant illegality—with a focus on deportability—and ecological-based and age-stratified life course approaches to offer new understandings of how deportation fears shape lived experiences. Then, through semi-structured interviews with older undocumented immigrants, I identify three key mechanisms that shape the shifts in fear of deportation in late adulthood: embodiment of illegality, life transitions, and temporal morality with culturally defined age norms. These valuable insights reveal the complex dynamics of the fear of deportation. Ultimately, I argue that fear of deportation and its consequences are a function of one’s place in the life course and that the LCI model is best suited to understand these shifts.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf061","doi":"10.1093/sf/soaf061","journal_full":"Social Forces","dist":0.5343,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Does outsourcing of domestic work reduce gender inequality in labor force participation within households?—a couple-level panel analysis","authors":"Liat Raz-Yurovich, Assaf Tsachor-Shai","abstract":"The time devoted to unpaid work in the domestic sphere reduces time devoted to paid work, and this time loss is higher for women than for men.

Using an analytic sample of 85,282 married heterosexual non-Haredi Jewish couples aged 25–64 from the harmonized panel database of the Israeli Labor Force Survey for the years 2000–2017, and by employing an instrumental variable approach with fixed-effects two-stage least squares models, we find that outsourcing positively affects the likelihood of working and the number of weekly working hours, but only among highly educated women.

We find that using LLMs to annotate and code text can introduce bias that can lead to misleading inferences. By bias we mean that the errors that LLMs make in coding interview transcripts are not random with respect to the characteristics of the interview subjects. Training simpler supervised models on high-quality human codes leads to less measurement error and bias than LLM annotations.

Taking Chinese online opinion leaders as an example, this study employs multiple correspondence analysis to estimate the ideological spectrum of these leaders.

The model incorporates Bayesian networks to capture causal dependencies among key variables such as economic integration, political reconfiguration, military deterrence, and international intervention; employs Markov chains to simulate the evolution of long-term social opinion in Taiwan; and evaluates optimal unification strategies under multiple scenarios via a decision tree algorithm. The framework also introduces system dynamics techniques and advanced visualization tools to enhance the interpretability and decision support functions of the model.The quantitative simulation results show that economic dependence is the core driving force for peaceful unification. When Taiwan's economic dependence on China exceeds 60%, the probability of peaceful unification rises to over 70% within 20 years. Sustained military deterrence significantly reduces the likelihood of direct external intervention, and the probability of successful military unification is significantly higher in a scenario where the U.S. and Japan's military response is limited. The study also finds that a shift in the island's political ecology is crucial: the dominance of pro-continental parties increases the probability of reunification by more than 30%.In terms of short-term unification strategies (within 5 years), simulation results show that the probability of successful unification can be over 85% if high-intensity military pressure, economic blockade and political polarization are adopted, and the U.S. and Japan's military intervention is effectively blocked. However, such strategies come with significant geopolitical risks. To reduce the risk, the model suggests supplementing the tactics with strategic deception, diplomatic mediation, psychological warfare, and precision military operations.This study proposes a transferable modeling approach for simulating complex geopolitical scenarios, combining probabilistic insights with dynamic visualization analysis, to provide scientific support for strategic planning and policymaking.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uy4k8_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/uy4k8_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4009,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Manufacturing Revolutions: Industrial Policy and Industrialization in South Korea","authors":"Nathan Lane","abstract":"I study the impact of industrial policy on industrial development by considering an important episode during the East Asian miracle: South Korea's heavy and chemical industry (HCI) drive, 1973 - 1979.

Each intervention is made up of a voucher to fund job search assistance and a performance-based payment related to job search intermediation. Participants are assigned to a certain group with a certain treatment endowment that is increasing as a function of a scoring variable.

First, being assigned to an intermediate-dose treatment slightly increased the probability of finding an open-ended employment, but this did not generate an increment in the average of days worked. Second, being assigned to a high-dose treatment only augmented the mean and the median of the distribution of days worked during the second semester and it did with a greater prevalence of short temporary contracts. Third, different treatment assignments barely changed the reception of job search assistance, so the impacts stem from job search intermediation.

Drawing on Meehl’s framework, we argue criminological knowledge risks resembling “Monopoly money in the bank” rather than genuine scientific currency. We propose fundamental shifts: prioritizing precise description of concrete phenomena, subjecting theories to risky tests, critically questioning psychometric assumptions, and generating high-resolution data. While academic incentives are a significant barrier, we also explore arguments that these incentives may reflect deeper disciplinary tendencies that favor broader narratives over precise, falsifiable knowledge. The path toward cumulative criminology involves developing approaches that precisely capture complexity while yielding falsifiable knowledge, rather than lowering standards.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5af2s_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/5af2s_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4317,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"A pilot pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a combined deterrence message and audio-recording enabled domestic abuse alarm intervention","authors":"Iain Brennan, David Rowlands, Nicola O'Leary, Jana Kujundzic","abstract":"Accounts of technological advances in the area of domestic abuse have tended to focus on their role in facilitating abuse with less attention paid to how technology can be used to protect victims and deter potential abusers.

Victim-abusers dyads were successfully randomised at court in 85% of cases and the deterrence message was delivered to the intervention group in 83% of cases, half of which were in court and half of which were via telephone or post. All eligible victims were offered the alarm by a police domestic abuse liaison officer, but fewer than 10% accepted the alarm. No statistically significant difference was observed in rates of order breach or domestic abuse crimes across conditions. Randomisation and delivery of deterrence messaging by police in court combined with the offer of an AREDAA alarm to victims was determined to be feasible, but intervention fidelity was dependent on perpetrator attendance at court and victim support for domestic violence protection orders, both of which were low.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cm7fp_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/cm7fp_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3828,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Reframing Suicide as a Multifactorial Phenomenon: Toward a One Health Approach in Public Mental Health","authors":"Ryu Murakami","abstract":"Japan has one of the highest suicide mortality rates among the G7 countries, with suicide being the leading cause of death among young people—a serious public health concern.

Internal migration, which refers to the domestic movement of people, is often driven by intersecting economic, social, and environmental factors. Climate change is increasing but unevenly playing a role in decisions to migrate. The study emphasizes India’s status as a climate-migration hotspot, characterized by diverse geographic and population heterogeneity, and highlights the limitations of existing migration data, particularly the delayed 2021 Census. To address these gaps, the paper employs a novel statistical approach to estimate district out-migration, district-to-district migration, and district in-migration around 2021 by leveraging data from the 2001 and 2011 censuses alongside temperature and precipitation extremes derived from historical climate records from 1961-2021. The methodology integrates harmonized district boundaries and fixed-effects modeling to account for confounding factors while projecting migration trends under varying climatic conditions. Results reveal significant associations between climatic extremes, both positive and negative and migration flows, underscoring the role of climate stressors in shaping migration decisions. By generating predictive estimates for 2021 migration patterns, the study offers insights into how climate variability potentially influences internal migration dynamics in India. The findings contribute to broader discussions on how to incentivize climate change adaptation given the reality of highly mobile populations in India and provides pointers on reducing vulnerabilities in migrant-sending and migrant-receiving areas.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k67wh_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/k67wh_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4927,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Disciplinary Value of Linguistic Capital in the Social Sciences and Humanities","authors":"Julien Larregue, Alice Pavie","abstract":"This article examines the relationship between linguistic practices and funding success in Canadian social sciences and humanities.

We argue that fairML frameworks must explicitly distinguish technical fairness—focused on unbiased predictions—from normative justice, which addresses broader ethical and distributive considerations. We identify and discuss five key challenges confronting fairML today: (1) clearly separating fairness and justice, (2) developing more sophisticated measures of vulnerability and protected attributes, (3) incorporating historical disadvantage and social origin into fairness evaluations, (4) assessing unintended social consequences of algorithmic interventions, and (5) empirically investigating stakeholder preferences toward AI systems. By highlighting these sociologically informed challenges, this chapter advocates for a more holistic, context-sensitive approach to algorithmic fairness. Ultimately, our analysis proposes a sociologically grounded research agenda aimed at critically assessing and enhancing the role of fairML in either perpetuating or alleviating social inequalities.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/39jcs_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/39jcs_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4317,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Discourse and collective identity in online resistance communities: Theoretical and computational insights","authors":"Dariya Koleva-Gebauer, Jan Lorenz","abstract":"This paper offers a comparative perspective into the discourse of two online communities on the forum social media platform Reddit: r/antiwork, a group focused on the issues faced by workers with largely anti-capitalist sentiments, and r/TwoXchromosomes, a space for discussions of women’s struggles with anti-patriarchal views.

This study investigates the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4o as a natural language processing tool in post-editing Arabic translations across various domains, aiming to evaluate its performance in improving productivity, accuracy, consistency, and overall translation quality. Methods: The study involved a comparative analysis of Arabic translations generated by Google Translate. These texts, drawn from multiple domains, were post-edited by two professional human translators and ChatGPT-4o. Subsequently, three additional professional human post-editors evaluated both sets of post-edited outputs. To statistically assess the differences in quality between humans and ChatGPT-4o post-edits, a paired t-test was employed, focusing on metrics such as fluency, accuracy, coherence, and efficiency. Results: The findings indicated that human post-editors outperformed ChatGPT-4o in most quality metrics. However, ChatGPT-4o demonstrated superior efficiency, yielding a positive t-statistic of 8.00 and a p-value of 0.015, indicating a statistically significant difference. Regarding fluency, no significant difference was observed between the two methods (t-statistic = −3.5, p-value = 0.074), suggesting comparable performance in ensuring the natural flow of text. Discussion: ChatGPT-4o showed competitive performance in English-to-Arabic post-editing, particularly in producing fluent, coherent, and stylistically consistent text. Its conversational design enables efficient and consistent editing across various domains. Nonetheless, the model faced challenges in handling grammatical and syntactic nuances, domain-specific idioms, and complex terminology, especially in medical and sports contexts.

The analysis revolves around the three main ESG pillars each through panel data regressions complemented by instrumental variable (IV) approaches in addressing endogeneity concerns. In the Environment (E) dimension, we find conventional agricultural forms (e.g., extensive agricultural land areas and agriculture value added) as having a negative effect on financial inclusion, but the environmental modernization proxies—renewable energy utilization, food production, climate resilience, and areas under protection—exhibit positive and significant correlations. In the Social (S) dimension, development indicator variables like spending on education, internet penetration, life years at birth, sanitation, and gender equity emerge as strong predictors of higher financial inclusion, and labor market participation is found to have a negative effect, possibly due to the dynamics of employment in the informal sector. The Governance (G) analysis shows positive correlation with controlling corruption and innovation production (applications for patents) as arguments for increased financial access improving institutional transparency and economic ingenuity and a negative correlation with regulatory quality as a concern for capacity gaps in rapidly digitizing economies. Through the means of ESG-matched environmental instruments, this paper presents a unique cross-dimensional approach to sustainable finance and shows through counterfactual analysis under both average and counterfactual distributions that policies supporting financial inclusion can be a path to multiple benefits on the environmental sustainability, social equity, and governance effectiveness axes—key requirements for the success of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the Global South.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uhk5f_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/uhk5f_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.427,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Social class mobility in the early modern Europe: a first international comparison","authors":"Marco H.D.

More than expected, however, sons with fathers from outside the farming class succeeded in becoming a farmer. Barriers between the sectors seem to have been weak in Sweden.

Critically, we observe LLMs achieve this while explicitly referencing known survey results and the broader literature, even without direct prompting. We further show these correlations can be amplified or effectively eliminated by subtle changes in evaluation task design, revealing that replicating known results does not validate LLMs as naive subjects. Given LLMs' access to relevant literature, their ability to replicate known human behavior constitutes an invalid evaluation for assessing the suitability of large language models as naive subjects.

This article presents a discussion on the use of IoT in conjunction with Artificial Intelligence to obtain new solutions for planning, management, and services in smart cities. The analysis is based on a literature review that seeks to identify answers to questions involving urban planning in cities, the structuring themes of smart cities, AI techniques, and data collection. The results point to a powerful synergy between IoT and AI, aiming to develop innovative, effective, and integrated services to address the challenges of contemporary urban planning.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r36yg_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/r36yg_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.2672,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Regional News, Regional Bias? Media Influence on Administrative Decisions in Welfare Offices","authors":"Stefanie Rueß","abstract":"How do media representations of immigrants affect their access to public services? Though prior research links national news reporting and administrative decisions, little is known about regional variation, an important omission because regional media produces more local news. I argue that street-level bureaucrats are embedded within a regional news environment, where reporting shapes their perception of regional immigration patterns and influences their decisions on public service allocation—a dynamic I term the regional media bias mechanism. To examine this phenomenon, I combine state-level data on benefit reduction rates in Germany’s welfare program Citizen’s Benefit with regional newspaper articles (2010-2020). Leveraging topic modeling and panel data analysis, I show that regional narratives on positive aspects of immigration are associated with more favorable administrative outcomes for immigrants, whereas frames emphasizing financial burdens correspond with stricter treatment. These results highlight the critical role of regional media in shaping policy implementation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7x83_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/v7x83_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.657,"specialized":false,"preprint":true}]
