[{"title": "How the Pro-Beijing Media Influences Voters: Evidence from a Randomized Field Experiment", "authors": "JAY C. KAO", "abstract": "Authoritarian regimes have increasingly leveraged foreign media to project influence within democracies, yet evidence of these co-opted outlets’ actual effects remains scarce. This study presents findings from a field experiment conducted during Taiwan’s 2020 general election, assessing the impact of The China Times, a Beijing-backed media conglomerate, on voter behavior and attitudes. The experiment incentivized participants to engage in sustained consumption of real-time news from this outlet in the weeks leading up to the election. Results from a panel survey linked to individual-level web-tracking data reveal that exposure to The China Times sways voters in favor of the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These effects, however, are primarily driven by nonpartisan and PRC-friendly voters. To the extent that I find effects among PRC-skeptics, they show evidence of backfiring. As Beijing’s media co-optation extends beyond Taiwan, my findings have broader implications for understanding the effectiveness and limitations of authoritarian influence operations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055426101476", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055426101476", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007862670608220101}, {"title": "Adolescent Exposure to Economic Inequality and Belief in the ‘American Dream’ on Entering Adulthood", "authors": "Stephanie L.

A prominent vein of scholarship explores whether exposure to inequality diminishes belief in a key pillar of the ‘American dream’ – the meritocratic ideal that hard work will translate to economic success. We offer this literature a novel test that explores the relationship between quotidian exposure to economic inequality in one’s adolescent residential context and belief in the American dream among roughly 1.3 million late-adolescent Americans entering college. We find that adolescent residence in high-inequality areas is associated with decreased belief in the American dream upon entering adulthood.

Using original, nationally representative survey data, we find that populist attitudes do not uniformly predict support for martial law; rather, their influence is fundamentally shaped by respondents’ ideological leanings. Among citizens with strong populist orientations, those on the ideological right exhibit a significantly greater propensity to endorse martial law, whereas their counterparts on the left display pronounced resistance to such authoritarian measures.

In addition, on a microeconomic and countercyclical scale, infant mortality and out‐of‐pocket spending increase as HCF intensifies. Foreign remittances can mitigate this by providing financial support for households' private health expenditures and capacity development. This study illustrates that in the present era of transnationalism, reliance on the microeconomic need for remittances as a justification for HCF is counterproductive.

We address this puzzle by looking to geographically concentrated industries, and how they relate to regional identity. While most often presented as a source of regional strength, we show that industrial hubs in the United States have accounted for more job losses than gains over the last twenty years. We then show how this matters through three original survey studies. Workers in geographically concentrated industries belong to denser, more deeply-rooted peer networks; these are associated with a stronger view that politicians are responsible for preventing layoffs. Those same individuals also perceive economic shocks of equal magnitude as more damaging to their region’s standing, compared to the rest of the country. Perceptions of lost regional standing, in turn, are associated with greater demand for populist leadership traits. Finally, we show how these individual attitudes translate into aggregate political behavior. Employment losses in industrial hubs are tied to greater support for Republican candidates, while equivalent losses in non-hubs show no analogous effect. Our account presents a competing picture to the dominant narrative of industrial hubs as founts of innovation and productivity.

To distinguish between spontaneous and induced abortions, we exploit sociodemographic differentials, exposure timing, and regional differences in son preference. We find that days with a maximum temperature above 20 °C are negatively associated with male births in both regions. In sub-Saharan Africa, we observe fewer male births after high first-trimester temperature exposure, consistent with increased spontaneous abortions from maternal heat stress. This is particularly true for births by mothers in rural areas, with little formal education, and for higher birth orders. By contrast, in India, we find that second-trimester temperature exposure is associated with fewer male births, consistent with reductions in induced sex-selective abortions. As expected, these reductions are concentrated in high birth orders and older mothers. We also find large reductions in male births by sonless mothers in northern Indian states, where son preference is greater.

The benefits of the ambient standards are moderated by the high levels of household air pollution to which people are exposed due to the concavity of the exposure–response function.

Having more hasslers is associated with accelerated biological aging in both rate and cumulative burden: Each additional hassler corresponds to approximately 1.5% faster pace of aging and roughly 9 mo older biological age.

We develop a mathematical model of the coevolution of actions, private attitudes, and beliefs about others, with societal tightness as a central parameter. Our framework integrates theories of spirals of silence, preference falsification, and cultural mismatch into a single dynamic system capturing the effects of material payoffs, cognitive forces, and social influence. The model shows that pluralistic ignorance can arise from lags between attitude change and belief updating, even without silence or deception. Dynamics unfold faster in loose cultures and slower in tight ones: loose societies display sharp but transient peaks of pluralistic ignorance, while tight societies sustain slower, persistent mismatches. Both can experience cultural evolutionary mismatch but through distinct pathways—internalized norm adherence in loose cultures vs. conformity pressure in tight ones. These mechanisms may help explain global patterns where private support exceeds perceived support, such as climate action, women’s rights, and abortion attitudes. Interventions must therefore be culturally tailored: accelerating attitude change through highlighting benefits is effective in loose cultures, whereas lowering expression costs (via anonymity or legal protections) empowers norm entrepreneurs in tight cultures. Our framework identifies policy levers and clarifies when apparent opinion stability conceals underlying shifts, offering insights for democratic societies navigating rapid social change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2522998123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2522998123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.026664843887467704}, {"title": "Redefining koinophilia: Solution to social isolation and polarization", "authors": "Chika Edward Uzoigwe", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2537378123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2537378123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06088849646340455}, {"title": "Avalanches of choice: How stranger-to-stranger interactions shape crowd dynamics", "authors": "Ziqi Wang, Alessandro Gabbana, Federico Toschi", "abstract": "Pedestrian routing choices play a crucial role in shaping collective crowd dynamics, yet the influence of interactions among unfamiliar individuals remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze real-world pedestrian behavior at a route split within a busy train station using high-resolution trajectory data collected over a three-year time frame. We disclose a striking tendency for individuals to follow the same path as the person directly in front of them, even in the absence of social ties and even when such a choice leads to a longer travel time. This tendency leads to bursty dynamics, where sequences of pedestrians make identical decisions in succession, leading to strong patterns in collective movement. We employ a stochastic model that includes route costs, randomness, and social imitation to accurately reproduce the observed behavior, highlighting that local imitation behavior is the dominant driver of collective routing choices. These findings highlight how brief, low-level interactions between strangers can scale up to influence large-scale pedestrian movement, with strong implications for crowd management, urban design, and the broader understanding of social behavior in public spaces.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2528167123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2528167123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015615761868590372}, {"title": "Correction for Lee et al., Saccade-related LFP power transients in the primate amygdala and hippocampus linked to the perception of social status", "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2603598123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2603598123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.025809181757271427}, {"title": "Lamin B receptor upregulation in metastatic melanoma causes nuclear envelope fragility in confined migration during cancer invasion", "authors": "Michelle A.

challenges for bureaucracies as politicians undermine democratic institutions and the rule of law. Although bureaucracies can play a central safeguarding role, little is known about the organizational conditions that foster resistance to undemocratic pressure. This study tests whether organizational networks (peers and professional associations) and resources (expertise and voice mechanisms) influence bureaucrats' willingness to oppose undemocratic demands from political superiors. Drawing on a preregistered conjoint survey experiment with Brazilian bureaucrats ( N = 2481; 14,886 evaluations), we find that support from peers, professional associations, and credible voice channels increases open resistance, whereas peer disagreement reduces silent resistance. This study is among the first large‐scale survey experiments to manipulate organizational attributes in democratic backsliding. We advance scholarship by developing a meso‐level organizational framework that connects networks and resources to micro‐level resistance, bridging research on democratic backsliding and behavioral public administration, and providing practical guidance for strengthening democratic guardianship in organizations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.70097", "doi": "10.1111/puar.70097", "journal_full": "Public Administration Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005312802225539093}, {"title": "A Chequered History but Positive Future for British Public Administration", "authors": "Ian C.

The applied era saw mutual exchange, but a lack of criticality. The fragmented era was one of a retreat to over‐specialization and identity crises. The impactful era has tried to revivify synergies but has struggled for coherence and criticality.

Findings reveal that although social capital is associated with higher vaccination rates, its benefits are unequally realized, favoring Whites over Blacks. Racial segregation weakens the positive effect of social capital for Blacks and exacerbates health disparities. Liberal ideology amplifies the influence of social capital on vaccination rates for Whites, but this amplifying role is not statistically significant for Blacks or the racial gap.

Our results show that democracy and regime sustainability significantly and statistically improve inclusive growth in Africa. The robustness of these results is confirmed by taking into account governance indicators and the homogenization of resource‐poor countries. However, regime sustainability and democracy significantly reduce inclusive growth in resource‐rich countries. Plausible explanations for the contradictory results lie in the curse of natural resources and the rentier behavior of certain political leaders, which complicate the structural transformation of natural endowments.

Drawing on institutional and network perspectives, this article examines the direct and indirect effects of mandates on collaborative tie formation during crises. Using social network analysis of collaborative ties among 424 organizations—including members of 62 legally mandated safety and disaster committees—during the 2015 epidemic in South Korea, the study shows that both direct bureaucratic and network‐mediated mechanisms shaped these ties, with indirect effects predominating. It reveals how relational dynamics at the dyadic and group levels mediated collaborative ties, accounting for sequential and feedback effects between levels and comparing these effects in mandated versus voluntary ties.

We use this evidence to estimate damage functions in a neoclassical growth model.

Household observable characteristics explain only 8% of MPC variation, highlighting the role of latent heterogeneity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdaf102", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdaf102", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00689424620515855}, {"title": "Decision Theory for Treatment Choice Problems with Partial Identification", "authors": "José Luis Montiel Olea, Chen Qiu, Jörg Stoye", "abstract": "We apply classical statistical decision theory to a large class of treatment choice problems with partial identification. We show that, in a general class of problems with Gaussian likelihood, all decision rules are admissible; it is maximin-welfare optimal to ignore all data; and, for severe enough partial identification, there are infinitely many minimax-regret optimal decision rules, all of which sometimes randomize the policy recommendation. We uniquely characterize the minimax-regret optimal rule that least frequently randomizes, and show that, in some cases, it can outperform other minimax-regret optimal rules in terms of what we term profiled regret. We analyze the implications of our results in the aggregation of experimental estimates for policy adoption, extrapolation of Local Average Treatment Effects, and policy making in the presence of omitted variable bias.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag015", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag015", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007129962617766328}, {"title": "A 36-ring zeolite with intrinsic cylindrical mesopores", "authors": "Jiazheng Sun, Xudong Tian, Zhenghan Zhang, Jing Liu, Lei Han, Fanrong Xu, Han Jiang, Chao Ma, Hongwei Guo, Cong Lin, Qike Jiang, Guangchao Li, Tsz Woon Benedict Lo, Haitao Song, Wei Lin, Le Xu, Jian Li", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aec4882", "doi": "10.1126/science.aec4882", "journal_full": "Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.022605522718855076}, {"title": "Deeper detection limits in astronomical imaging using self-supervised spatiotemporal denoising", "authors": "Yuduo Guo, Hao Zhang, Mingyu Li, Fujiang Yu, Yunjing Wu, Yuhan Hao, Song Huang, Yongming Liang, Xiaojing Lin, Xinyang Li, Jiamin Wu, Zheng Cai, Qionghai Dai", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.ady9404", "doi": "10.1126/science.ady9404", "journal_full": "Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.023828514093850783}, {"title": "Single-molecule infrared spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy", "authors": "Kangkai Liang, Zihao Wang, Weike Quan, Yueqing Shi, Hao Zhou, Liya Bi, Zhiyuan Yin, Nathan Romero, Mark Young, Shaowei Li", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adz6643", "doi": "10.1126/science.adz6643", "journal_full": "Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03153111132423925}, {"title": "Onset of millennial climate variability with the intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation", "authors": "David A.

Drawing on forty-three in-depth interviews, I show that officers actively seek out elements of applicants’ claims that elicit intellectual stimulation and emotional resonance. This investment not only reinforces their self-image as morally committed professionals—distinguished from colleagues perceived as disengaged—but also reorients their professional mission around intentional, affectively engaged adjudication. Crucially, officers come to treat their aspirational mode of interaction as a moral lens through which they evaluate claims, granting greater worth to those that provoke the desired emotional response—often irrespective of applicants’ demographic characteristics or the formal merits of their cases. This analysis advances sociological theorizing on how aspirations, affect, and morality interact to shape frontline organizational practice.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag007", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag007", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.4013572034885934}, {"title": "Class origin closure: economic advantages of occupational elitism", "authors": "Dirk Witteveen", "abstract": "This study investigates the role of class origin compositions of micro-occupations in creating economic inequalities using three decades of British longitudinal surveys. Drawing on social closure theory, we analyze how class origin contributes to between-occupation earnings disparities and class origin earnings inequality at the individual level. Using fine-grained data on the class origins of occupational incumbents, we construct a robust indicator of the concentration of privileged class origins within labor market niches, “occupational elitism,” measured as the percentage of incumbents with parents in the higher salariat (ESeC class 1) within an occupation. Our results reveal that occupational elitism of micro-occupations is positively associated with earnings, after accounting for indicators of positional closure mechanisms, such as educational credentialing, licensure, and unionization. However, these collective earnings premiums are unevenly distributed, with earnings advantages for individuals from upper-class families emerging in occupations with higher levels of occupational elitism.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag012", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag012", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.02306226180047355}, {"title": "Review of “Science and Inequality: A Political Sociology”", "authors": "Janet Vertesi", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag006", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag006", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.02783924899068968}, {"title": "Review of “Homesick: Race and Exclusion in Rural New England”", "authors": "Japonica Brown-Saracino", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag005", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag005", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06775833345601123}, {"title": "Review of “The Criminal Record Complex: Risk, Race, and the Struggle for Work in America”", "authors": "Hana Shepherd", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag008", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag008", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03607686815717592}, {"title": "The (in)appropriateness of unequal division: a factorial survey experiment on wealth transfers within families", "authors": "Nhat An Trinh, Daria Tisch, Manuel Schechtl", "abstract": "Siblings do not always benefit equally from parental wealth transfers.

We deliberately oversampled substantial wealth owners to highlight differences in attitudes toward wealth transfers between those at the top of the wealth distribution and a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 40 and older. In line with previous research, equality emerges as the dominant principle for all asset types. Siblings’ gender and birth order do not consistently affect evaluations of unequal transfers. However, the wealthy are less likely to endorse equality if one child is older or seems better positioned to maintain the family business than their sibling. Our findings suggest that the wealthy legitimize unequal transfers based on concerns for continuous wealth accumulation and the perpetuation of key economic assets across generations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag010", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag010", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012706242306360527}, {"title": "Sick of your poor neighborhood?

Although there is a clear education‒fertility dynamic, significant educational shifts have occurred and it is unclear how much this contributed to recent fertility declines. To disentangle this, we utilize high-quality Norwegian register data and model yearly transitions between educational enrollment, educational attainment, and childbearing for men and women born in 1964‒2006. Using a counterfactual simulation approach, we explore the contribution of educational expansion versus lower fertility within educational groups to the decline in period and cohort fertility. Forecasting is used to complete fertility for cohorts aged 30+. We found that educational expansion contributed partially to the observed cohort fertility decline (2.11 to 1.98 children) for 1964‒1978 female cohorts but stagnated for younger cohorts. The predicted decline thereafter (to 1.59 children by the 1992 cohort), as well as the 2010s period fertility decline, was fully driven by decreased fertility across educational levels. For men, educational expansion was slower and did not contribute to fertility decline. For both genders, the contribution of changed fertility behavior was strongest among the low and medium educated, particularly for predicted ultimate childlessness. Our results suggest that increased education is not the main fertility barrier in contemporary Norway. Instead, falling birth rates, particularly among lower educated groups, are driving the fertility decline for both genders.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1215/00703370-12475875", "doi": "10.1215/00703370-12475875", "journal_full": "Demography", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019770955624699993}, {"title": "The Earnings Assimilation of Unauthorized Immigrants", "authors": "Andrés Villarreal, Christopher R.

We show how the recent re‐engineering of corruption as a “deficit of office accountability” enhances the concept's ability to capture uses of office power that may undercut institutional functioning beyond illegal acts, including individual wrongdoing and faulty institutional design. Re‐engineering corruption has normative value insofar as it helps policymakers and scholars alike to identify and address questionable uses of office power—including in nondemocratic regimes and nonpublic organizations.

We offer a dynamic model of nondemocratic politics in which repression and bad decision making are self‐reinforcing. Repression reduces the immediate threat to the regime, yet raises future stakes for the dictator; with higher stakes, the dictator puts more emphasis on loyalty than competence, which in turn increases the probability of a wrong policy choice.

The more repression there is, the less information exists in AI's training data, and the worse the AI performs. I illustrate this argument using an AI experiment and censorship data in China.

Additional analyses indicate that the previously documented curvilinear relationship between sleep duration and turnout emerges primarily among those with poor sleep quality, while duration shows no association with turnout among well‐rested individuals, suggesting duration may serve a compensatory function when quality is compromised.

In Study 3 ( N = 543), emphasizing personal costs of energy isolationism reduced support for grid independence among those high in collective narcissism. This finding suggests that self‐related motives might be behind the appeal of isolationist policies for those high in collective narcissism.

Yet, we know very little about the ‘new’ third generation—that is, the grandchildren of immigrants who immigrated in the postwar era to Europe. Here, we rely on new, large-scale French data providing a unique opportunity to study the socioeconomic attainment of third-generation individuals in adulthood compared with the second generation and French natives. We jointly analyze educational and labor market attainment using five indicators at both the top and bottom of the distributions, leading to a comprehensive understanding of immigrant incorporation across generations. We report three major results. First, we find a master trend across groups and outcomes reflecting parity with natives, often already achieved at the second generation. Second, third-generation attainment is moderated by gender and national origins: we document lasting educational disadvantages for North African, third-generation males, while Southern Europeans are more likely to experience economic incorporation within the lower class. Third, mixed ancestry ceases to positively predict socioeconomic attainment by the third generation. These results have important implications for ongoing scholarly discussion of immigrant incorporation in France and beyond.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcag004", "doi": "10.1093/esr/jcag004", "journal_full": "European Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9953867768832054}, {"title": "The factor structure of jump risk", "authors": "Torben G.

Moreover, we reason that ideology should matter more for elites than the public. Unique data from a survey with legislators in 19 European countries and public opinion surveys in three countries allow us to test this argument. We find that elites and the public indeed differ in their attitudes toward compensatory policies.

To test this, I analyse speeches from the UK House of Commons from 2010 to 2021, and find that women MPs both speak proportionately more about the environment than their male counterparts, and bring environmentalism into debates that are not explicitly coded as environmental. Finally, while Conservative women are outnumbered by men, they contribute significantly more to environmental speeches than their male counterparts.

We test this idea through two pre-registered survey experiments conducted after the 2022 and 2024 elections in the United States. We randomly assign partisans to receive either a placebo or an emotive reminder about the election that their party lost, containing others’ angry or worried reactions at the election outcome. Contrary to our pre-registered expectations, we do not find evidence that priming negative feelings about electoral loss affects support for political violence or democratic norms. Emotive reminders about salient political events can momentarily turn up the heat on politics, but are not enough to propel partisans to adopt extreme anti-democratic attitudes.

We build on a rich body of work, which establishes that culturally liberal Europeans are more likely to value diversity and favor minority rights than are cultural conservatives. Our contribution is to bring attention to how a second dimension of value conflict upends this established pattern. If a religious minority, in this case Muslims, wants to use their religious freedom to call on Muslims to adhere to conservative Islamic values – to preach them – support for their civil liberties plunges. We report substantively large and remarkably consistent results from seven classical tolerance experiments conducted in three European countries. In each trial, we observe the tendency of non-Muslims to deny Muslims their right to freedom of religion. We consistently observe that culturally liberal citizens join cultural conservatives in turning against Muslims’ right to hold a public rally when Muslims intend to exercise their right to freedom of expression to preach (the speech-act dimension) culturally conservative ideas in Islam ( the substantive dimension ). Preaching is a performative utterance, an instance of when saying something is doing something. What is being done, in addition to what is being said, is to call for compliance. This study finds that conflicts with religiously grounded values in contemporary European liberal democracies often have an additional order of intensity, because stating religious beliefs in the form of performative utterances is an integral part of religious practice.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676526100759", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676526100759", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.07123384722888138}, {"title": "Does ideology trump geography?

This study probes how the EU’s efforts to redress democratic backsliding in several EU member states crystallise deepening divides between European lawmakers. Our empirical analysis examines 17 roll-call votes on rule of law issues and well over 900 discursive statements from corresponding parliamentary debates held between 2009 and 2019. Our unique approach enables us to analyse discursive and voting patterns both separately and jointly to understand how they affect each other. We find that behaviour across these different arenas is generally consistent and aligns with an ideological divide that pits Eurosceptic Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) against representatives from pro-EU European party groups. Once we account for ideological orientations and strategic motivations, the often-claimed East–West divide on rule of law issues becomes much less salient, emerging primarily under specific conditions of ongoing democratic erosion and national incumbency in Central and Eastern Europe.

Recent crises—such as COVID-19, the Great Recession, and environmental disasters—expose limitations of the standard social science toolkit for studying poverty and offer lessons for improving poverty and policy research. Regarding measurement, evidence suggests that the intrayear volatility of incomes and blurred boundaries between resource-sharing units deserve greater focus in poverty measurement debates. Regarding consequences, research emphasizes the need to quantify poverty's distinct roles as a risk factor versus stratifying feature during crises. Regarding sources, evidence from recent crises offer direct tests of competing theories of poverty and offer clear lessons for policy strategies to reduce poverty.

Using these expressed positions, we document two key facts. First, witnesses are significantly more supportive of Republican‐sponsored legislation than Democratic‐sponsored legislation. Second, after estimating ideal points for witnesses, we find witnesses are ideologically closer to Illinois Republicans than Democrats.

We first develop an ontology for analyzing these processes. We then analyze the role of social structure in these stages and define the emergence process in terms of hazards, that is, the event rates of each stage.

Prospect theory posits that individuals’ risk decision preferences are influenced by the framing of gains or losses, but it does not distinguish whether gains and losses pertain to personal or public interests. This study incorporates the type of interest with gain–loss framing to construct decision scenarios and compare risk preferences between public officials and private sector employees. In Experiment 1 (Npublic officials = 897, Nprivate sector employees = 685), using a 3 (public interest vs. public-private mixed interest vs. private interest) × 2 (gain frame vs. loss frame) design, public officials were found to exhibit greater risk aversion than private sector employees when the loss frame involves the public interest, while no significant differences were observed for a gain frame involving either the public interest or private interest. Applying blame avoidance theory, accountability is positioned here as a core factor to further explore why public officials are more risk-averse than private sector employees when facing public interest losses. In Experiment 2 (Npublic officials = 625, Nprivate sector employees = 630), using a 2 (reward vs. punishment-oriented accountability) × 2 (process vs. outcome-oriented accountability) design in a public interest decision-making context, public officials were found to be more risk-averse than private sector employees in the case of outcome-oriented punishment accountability. In the other three types of accountability conditions, public officials exhibited a similar risk preference to private sector employees.

To test our argument, we measure the partisan slant of gubernatorial rhetoric in 2,400 State of the State Addresses (1962–2023). We fine-tune BERT models to predict the partisanship of held-out speeches using other contemporaneous addresses as training data. When a governor “sounds like” her co-partisans, the model labels her speech as more partisan. This predicted probability provides a dynamic, time-varying measure of gubernatorial partisan slant.

This paper explores the relationship between incivility in social media and democracy, moving beyond simplistic claims that uncivil discourse is inherently harmful. It argues that different conceptions of why democracy is valuable—versions of egalitarian and electoral conceptions—offer distinct evaluative standpoints for the democratic consequences of incivility. Under egalitarian conceptions, incivility undermines democracy by silencing marginalized voices, reinforcing hierarchies of social status, or by degrading the deliberative processes that contribute to democratic legitimacy. Under electoral conceptions incivility poses a democratic problem either when it reduces political trust that impairs the value of accountability or when it erodes norms of legitimate opposition that are essential for civil peace. By analyzing these frameworks, the paper clarifies when and why incivility may pose a genuine threat to democracy while also proposing how to navigate conflicts between restraint and inclusion by advancing a novel account of the duties of civility in the public sphere.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129261425543", "doi": "10.1177/10659129261425543", "journal_full": "Political Research Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0036476936044962383}, {"title": "Presidential References to Executive Actions in Public Comments on Supreme Court Cases*", "authors": "Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, Paul M.

We examine the factors shaping presidents’ decisions to tie their executive actions to Court cases using a novel database covering the Eisenhower to Biden presidencies (1953–2024). We find that the president’s ideological proximity to the Court, agreement with the Court’s decisions, and approval ratings are especially important factors.

This paper investigates the conditions under which judicial councils promote or undermine government compliance with court rulings. I develop a model in which executives strategically design or reform judicial councils to influence court assertiveness, depending on the level of transparency and reputational risk. The model yields clear empirical expectations about when councils facilitate compliance and when they serve symbolic or even suppressive functions. To test these claims, I construct an original panel dataset of 47 European and neighboring countries (1945–2025) that includes detailed institutional features of judicial governance. Using multilevel regression models and extensive robustness checks, I find that councils only promote compliance when they are judge-dominated, institutionally empowered, and embedded in transparent political environments. By contrast, politically dominated or merely symbolic councils are associated with lower levels of compliance. The findings challenge the assumption that judicial councils are inherently democratizing and highlight how institutional design interacts with political context to shape executive-judicial relations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129261426542", "doi": "10.1177/10659129261426542", "journal_full": "Political Research Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004325326926058026}, {"title": "Gender, Party, and Primary Turnout", "authors": "Samantha J.

This study investigates whether a gender gap exists in congressional primary turnout and whether it varies by party. Using individual-level administrative voter-file data from all fifty states, we analyze turnout in the 2018 and 2022 congressional primaries, leveraging panel models that account for prior voting behavior. The data include five million observations and avoid common biases associated with survey-based turnout measures. We find a small but significant overall gender gap in congressional primary turnout, with women more likely to participate than men, consistent with research findings that women are stronger partisans. However, there is substantial partisan asymmetry: Republican women are significantly more likely than Republican men to vote in primaries, whereas Democratic women are equally or less likely to vote in primaries, depending on the electoral context. These findings suggest that gender gaps in primary participation are driven by women’s partisan attachment and party-specific mobilization dynamics, with implications for representation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/10659129261426024", "doi": "10.1177/10659129261426024", "journal_full": "Political Research Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007634405263388433}, {"title": "Conceptualizing Academic Freedom", "authors": "Jacob T.

Yet, international relations studies suggest that national policies based on international agreements terminate easily. What makes the difference? Widespread discontinuation of national action plans (NAPs) for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a case in point. NAPs are national strategic plans—and hence, national policies—for combatting AMR. More than 170 countries produced them in the years following global agreement to combat AMR in 2015, seeming to represent great success for new international norms. However, this article shows that 51% of countries with NAPs on record have terminated them, and terminations appear to be increasing. It probes plausibility of two conventional termination reasons and one novel: lost policy capacity, policy subsystem support loss, and the new one, domestic political rootlessness. The article shows that the last is clearly plausible in the AMR NAP case. This finding advances policy termination theory by illustrating how policies lacking firm roots in domestic institutions and policy subsystems—such as some originating in internationally agreed norms—can be easily abandoned by national governments once international attention and pressure move elsewhere.

This discourages the left from mobilizing on the issue. However, recent campaigns by the German Social Democrats (2021) and Labour in Britain (2017) overcame this taboo with distinct pro-tax programs. Our comparative analysis traces common factors and strategic considerations of party actors. It highlights the role of policy entrepreneurs, who act as catalysts through their exceptional motivation and competence.

I examine both the short‐ and long‐term impacts of the California Green Building Standards Code (CALGreen), comparing homes constructed just before and after its implementation in 2010. The findings show that, on average, CALGreen homes use 11.7% less water than comparable pre‐code homes, with savings persisting over time at approximately 10.9%. Notably, engineering‐based (ex ante) estimates of water savings are nearly twice as large as the realized reductions, likely reflecting the “offsetting behavior” effect. The analysis further reveals that most water savings occur during warmer months when outdoor water use peaks. In addition, CALGreen homes exhibit lower sensitivity to temperature fluctuations, with smaller increases in use during hotter months and smaller reductions during cooler months. Finally, when accounting for compliance costs and the opportunity cost of water, the results suggest that CALGreen policy passes a cost‐effectiveness test.

Combining tax and archival data, household surveys, historical national accounts, and rich lists, we document that the top 1% wealth share has fallen by half, from close to 50% in 1895 to 26% today. Nearly all of this decline was the result of changes that occurred between 1914 and 1952. Using a novel decomposition framework, we show that collapsing equity prices after World War I and in the Great Depression as well as taxation in the aftermath of World War II stand out as great equalizers in 20th century German history. After unification in 1990, two trends have left their mark on the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising business wealth while the middle-class had large capital gains in the housing market. The wealth share of the bottom 50% has halved since 1990.

Drawing on 66 life‐story interviews with internal migrants in Shenzhen, China, this article argues that these mechanisms share a common foundation in fertility norms, understood as socially embedded expectations about reproduction. While socialisation and assimilation have always centred on normative processes, the empirical analysis demonstrates that selection, disruption, and adaptation are likewise mediated by fertility norms – shaping how migrants assess destinations (selection), experience changes in normative constraint (disruption), and reinterpret reproductive expectations across contexts (adaptation). By establishing fertility norms as a unifying analytical lens, the article shows that migration and fertility operate as coordinated life domains. The analysis reveals that prior to migration, individuals evaluate destinations in light of anticipated fertility norms (selection). During migration and settlement, geographic separation from origin communities weakens normative monitoring and sanctioning, creating space for revising reproductive plans (disruption). Over time, sustained exposure to destination contexts reshapes fertility orientations and practices (adaptation), all unfolding against the longer‐term influence of childhood socialisation and intergenerational assimilation. This coordination reveals individuals as strategic navigators who integrate spatial mobility and reproductive decisions together, rather than experiencing them as separate, sequential events.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70230", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70230", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9732041172581369}, {"title": "Examining the Effects of Different Policy Approaches to Rural Depopulation Across Spanish Territories: Evidence From a Multi‐Scenario Simulation Study", "authors": "Luis Llases, Juanjo Mediavilla, Arthur Lauer, Raquel Gallego‐Medina", "abstract": "Rural depopulation linked to aging populations, economic decline, and reduced public services has accelerated migration to urban centres in various parts of the European Union and increasingly attracts the attention of policymakers.

Results demonstrate that while targeted interventions can improve socioeconomic indicators and slow demographic decline, only the comprehensive strategy (PS4) combining economic and service policies showed significant impacts, nearly stabilizing Zamora 's population and reducing the decline in Pirineo Navarro to a very slow pace. However, even this integrated approach failed to fully reverse depopulation in areas with severe demographic deterioration like Vitigudino , highlighting how initial conditions critically determine policy effectiveness. The findings yield several key insights: (1) national economic improvements (PS1) have minimal local impact in the absence of concrete policies on the territory, underscoring the need for place‐based strategies; (2) larger municipalities benefit more than smaller municipalities from many of the policies implemented due to economies of scale; and (3) the implementation of partial policies (PS2 and PS3) improves the quality of life of the inhabitants, but does not halt the depopulation process. These points underscore the imperative for enhanced multi‐level governance coordination to enable integrated policy interventions that can meaningfully counteract rural depopulation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70229", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70229", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.8720976653630609}, {"title": "Early Occupational Outcomes of University Graduates in Italy. A ‘Centre–Periphery’ Geographical Approach", "authors": "Francesca Tosi, Giulia Dugar, Livia Elisa Ortensi", "abstract": "The diversification of young people's life trajectories in Europe over the past 50 years has been significantly influenced by more uncertain social and economic conditions, marked by high youth unemployment and increasing job insecurity. In Italy, precariousness has propagated unevenly across regions and social strata, particularly affecting women and young people from the South, exacerbating existing territorial disparities. This study adopts a centre‐periphery approach to explore how the territorial features of Italian university graduates' places of origin impact their early occupational outcomes. Using individual‐level data from the Istat Survey on the Professional Paths of Italian Graduates (2015) and Eurostat's territorial typology indicators, we employ Heckman modelling to estimate the risk of non‐standard employment 4 years after graduation. Our findings reveal that graduates from marginal areas (predominantly rural, mountainous, or non‐metropolitan) face higher risks of non‐standard employment compared to those from central areas. No clear evidence links marginality in Southern areas to worse employment outcomes; instead, the highest internal territorial divide in terms of job insecurity is observed between central and marginal areas in Central Italy. Furthermore, we find that mobility during the school‐to‐work transition mitigates job insecurity risks, with movers from both central and marginal regions reporting better employment outcomes than stayers. This study contributes to the literature by adopting a new and underinvestigated geographical approach to the school‐to‐work transition, by highlighting the importance of territorial disparities in shaping young people's labour market trajectories and underscoring the complex interplay between territorial characteristics of places of origin and young people's employment prospects.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70226", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70226", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06046737154723192}, {"title": "Time and Precarity in ‘South−South’ Academic Mobility: A 2019−2023 Longitudinal Study of Pakistani PhD Students and Recent Graduates in China", "authors": "Mengwei Tu", "abstract": "China's rise as an education hub introduces a new dynamic to the current framework for understanding international academic mobility.

This study uses the Scottish Censuses of 2011 and 2022 to understand patterns and trends in the geographies of ageing and age mixing. With attention to urban‐rural differences, we examined, at the Data Zone (neighbourhood) level, spatial age segregation and age mixing using the Dissimilarity Index, cumulative proportion calculations, Simpson's Diversity Index and Global and Local Moran's I. This paper contributes new findings on the spatial and temporal patterns of ageing and age mixing in Scotland, with relevance for broader debates on health and social care provision, housing accessibility and equity, and population sustainability. First, it illustrates the stark sub‐national variation in geographies of age segregation; second, it demonstrates the value of an analytical and interpretive framework using concepts of urban hierarchy; third, it causes us to rethink typical understandings of ageing and the urban hierarchy. In particular, the analyses reveal high age segregation and low age diversity in urban areas together with the potential polarisation of older‐ and younger‐age areas in some parts of cities; stable age mixing in rural areas (but with decreasing age diversity); and accessible (town and rural) neighbourhoods exhibiting both increasing age segregation and diversity and acting as the lynchpin for understanding the local dynamics of age mixing over the last decade. Attention to spatial nuance also reveals that change in age diversity is spatially clustered.

In this article, I contend that Camp Studies today cannot remain simply another field of detached academic enquiry but has a responsibility for solidarity with encamped people in thought and action. If we are to be engaged and critical scholars of camps who are committed to social justice and liberation, then we must throw our weight behind the already unfolding abolitionist praxes of those who actively struggle against their own encampment.

Traditionally, economists model trade using gravity models, which rely on explicit covariates that might struggle to capture these subtler drivers of trade. In this work, we employ optimal transport and a deep neural network to learn a time-dependent cost function from data, without imposing a specific functional form. This approach consistently outperforms traditional gravity models in accuracy and has similar performance to three-way gravity models, while providing natural uncertainty quantification. Applying our framework to global food and agricultural trade, we show that low income countries experienced disproportionately higher increases in trade costs due to the war in Ukraine’s impact on wheat markets. We also analyse the effects of free-trade agreements and trade disputes with China, as well as Brexit’s impact on British trade with Europe, uncovering hidden patterns that trade volumes alone cannot reveal.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69694-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-69694-5", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011135621014507935}, {"title": "H3K4me1 directs H3K36me2 and H3K36me3 deposition in land plants", "authors": "Jiabing Wu, Jiachen Wang, Kangxi Du, Yingping Li, Wenhao Xie, Chenxi He, Qidan Xing, Xiang Li, Xiaoyu Zhu, Zhen Wu, Xiaolong Wu, Linghao Zhang, Wen-Hui Shen, Fei Lan, Jianhua Gan, Bing Liu, Aiwu Dong", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69632-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-69632-5", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.04321538639801281}, {"title": "Efficient methanol upcycling to ethylene glycol and glycolaldehyde via divergent C−C coupling synthesis", "authors": "Ming-Yu Qi, Chang-Long Tan, Zi-Rong Tang, Marco Conte, Yugang Sun, Yi-Jun Xu", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69656-x", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-69656-x", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03332030068295522}, {"title": "The clinical missense variant E282K in PPP3CA/calcineurin shifts substrate dephosphorylation by altering active site recruitment", "authors": "Karina T.

Drawing on analyses of political trust in China, we offer three key insights. First, determining the direction of social desirability bias in regression estimates—whether over- or underestimation—is challenging ex ante . Second, analyses of two nationally representative Chinese surveys, one incorporating a list experiment, cast doubt on the purported positive effect of social welfare expansion on political trust. Extending beyond social welfare and the Chinese case, we find similar biases when regressions rely on direct questions. Third, we show that certain identification strategies can partially mitigate regression bias when direct questions are unavoidable.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10080", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10080", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.022977893798311944}, {"title": "Fine-tuned large language models can replicate expert coding better than trained coders: a study on informative signals sent by interest groups", "authors": "Dahyun Choi, Denis Peskoff, Brandon M.

While existing studies highlight interest groups as strategic information providers, empirical analysis has been constrained by reliance on expert annotation. Using policy documents released by interest groups, this study shows that fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) outperform lightly trained workers, crowdworkers, and zero-shot LLMs in distinguishing two difficult-to-separate categories: informative signals that help improve political decision-making and associative signals that shape preferences but lack substantive relevance. We further demonstrate that the classifier generalizes out of distribution across two applications.

Surprisingly, the control group had higher acceptance rates than retrospective for both events, and for prospective in May.

We also test whether refutation frames elicit more negative sentiments—such as anger and disgust—while confirmation frames generate more positive emotional responses.

The findings show that body-positivity discourses under #RejectBodyAnxiety are profoundly reconfigured through their articulation with localized postfeminist formations and platform-mediated empowering mechanisms, reframing body positivity as ideal positivity —a postfeminist discourse that refines hegemonic beauty ideals by shedding their extreme traits ( Selective Subversion ) and making them appear attainable ( Tactical Conformity ), thereby transforming them into seemingly positive forms. While fostering empowerment, this discourse risks new exclusions, marginalizing some women and intensifying postfeminist contradictions. Tracing these sensibilities through social media, the study highlights their new forms in non-Western contexts and underscores the need to address emerging discourses in body image promotion.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051261419392", "doi": "10.1177/20563051261419392", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0061369937561205345}, {"title": "The Presumed Prevalence/Persuasiveness of Online Misinformation and Americans’ Dissatisfaction With Democracy", "authors": "Chloe Mortenson, Erik C.

Kelly Garrett", "abstract": "American public discourse about online misinformation often exaggerates its prevalence and persuasiveness, potentially harming Americans’ evaluations of democratic governance. This project uses two studies conducted during the 2020 and 2022 elections to test whether the presumed prevalence/persuasiveness of online misinformation (P3OM)—the perception that online misinformation is both widespread and persuasive—undermines Americans’ satisfaction with democracy. Fixed-effects regression analysis of an eight-wave online panel survey reveals that both dimensions of P3OM are correlated with reduced democratic satisfaction. A follow-up online survey experiment provides evidence that exposure to messages about online misinformation reduces democratic satisfaction. Theoretical implications and strategies for reducing the presumed influence of online misinformation on democratic satisfaction are discussed.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051261420610", "doi": "10.1177/20563051261420610", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009666989153239713}, {"title": "Practices of de-Europeanisation in Georgia: culture strategy 2025 as a case of policyfailing", "authors": "Olga Chumicheva", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21599165.2026.2627183", "doi": "10.1080/21599165.2026.2627183", "journal_full": "East European Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.20722457162025287}, {"title": "The User Experience of TikTok and Its Compatibility with News", "authors": "Irene Costera Meijer, Kenza Lamot, Tim Groot Kormelink", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2026.2626737", "doi": "10.1080/21670811.2026.2626737", "journal_full": "Digital Journalism", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0206416666173852}, {"title": "Defending Academic Freedom in Digital Journalism Studies: The Community Standing Up for the Field, the Scholarship, and the Scholars", "authors": "Oscar Westlund", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2026.2622163", "doi": "10.1080/21670811.2026.2622163", "journal_full": "Digital Journalism", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009154128779890747}, {"title": "The Time Dimension of Visual Journalism: The Rhythm of Photographic “Truth Claims”", "authors": "Patrik Åker, Jenni Mäenpää, Liudmila Voronova", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2026.2626733", "doi": "10.1080/21670811.2026.2626733", "journal_full": "Digital Journalism", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010611344422996827}, {"title": "Precarious labour in precarious times: the impact of the war in Israel/Palestine on non-citizen workers", "authors": "Maayan Niezna, Yahel Kurlander", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00511-6", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00511-6", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.24500027354795717}, {"title": "The tipping point of intolerance: radical-right elections and terrorist attacks as catalysts for anti-Muslim hate crime in Europe", "authors": "Álvaro Suárez Vergne, Héctor Cebolla Boado, Michael Lund, Inmaculada Serrano", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-026-00524-9", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-026-00524-9", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.1371407255013536}, {"title": "Early Childhood Investments and Women’s Work Outcomes across the Life Course", "authors": "Vida Maralani, Camille Portier, Berkay Özcan", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.15195/v13.a9", "doi": "10.15195/v13.a9", "journal_full": "Sociological Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019739229613579434}, {"title": "The marginal majority effect: When social influence produces lock-in", "authors": "Alexandros Gelastopoulos, Pantelis P.

Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet, several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock in. Here, we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the “marginal majority effect”: a discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of a marginal majority effect in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adr4237", "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.adr4237", "journal_full": "Science Advances", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01791750794626623}, {"title": "Munc13-1 couples DAG and Ca 2+ signaling to dynamic vesicle priming, synaptic short-term plasticity, and posttetanic potentiation", "authors": "Mrinalini Ranjan, Kun-Han Lin, Brian D.

Flood hazard and exposure in 2035 were assessed under four Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). Hazard decreases by about 10% in SSP1, remains stable in SSP2, and rises in SSP3 and SSP5, with SSP5 showing a 12% increase. Population exposure grows across all scenarios, with increases of 21% in SSP1, 25% in SSP2, 13% in SSP3, and 56% in SSP5.

Various methodological innovations have been developed to reduce or eliminate misspecification bias in propensity score methods; however, they are underused in sociological research. A comprehensive Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to evaluate the performance of these innovations compared with that of standard methods. The results show that while some of the more recently developed extensions or alternatives to propensity score methods can substantially reduce misspecification bias, some are biased even in the absence of misspecification. In addition, most methods are subject to bias amplification due to \"hidden dual misspecification\", a problem previously overlooked in methodological research. Among the estimators evaluated, entropy balancing was the most successful in both eliminating regular misspecification bias and reducing bias amplification.

A tal efecto, se hallan e interpretan los escenarios y las disquisiciones acaecidas a partir de la de 2015, identificando la ruptura metodológica introducida en 2015, que trajo consigo una discontinuidad en la serie histórica que compromete la comparabilidad longitudinal y puede estar produciendo una sobreestimación de los niveles reales de práctica deportiva. A partir de la revisión de los instrumentos de medición, las categorías de frecuencia empleadas y la forma de presentar los resultados —especialmente en términos de minutos acumulados de actividad—, planteamos que parte del aumento informado en la práctica responde a cambios en la definición y operacionalización del fenómeno más que a las transformaciones sociales y económicas equivalentes. Para demostrar la hipótesis, comparamos estos resultados con otros indicadores estructurales del sistema deportivo español —empleo, gasto público, gasto de los hogares, tejido empresarial y licencias federativas— que no muestran expansiones acordes con el supuesto incremento abrupto de la práctica desde 2015. Asimismo, apoyándonos en la discusión con otros estudios secundarios, comparamos los resultados sobre esta variable en la Encuesta de Hábitos Deportivos con los de la Encuesta Nacional de Salud, evidenciando con ello las divergencias en la estimación del cumplimiento de las recomendaciones de actividad física de la Organización Mundial de la Salud. Estas diferencias las identificamos como una disfunción que da cuenta del resultado de marcos conceptuales y metodológicos distintos más que como reflejo de una mejora homogénea del comportamiento deportivo de la población española en los periodos observados. Finalmente, subrayamos la necesidad de reforzar la dirección científico-técnica de estas operaciones estadísticas mediante la participación de los profesionales de las Ciencias de la Actividad Física y del Deporte, así como de orientar las políticas públicas en función de las cifras agregadas, así como de un análisis riguroso de la demanda de actividad física y de las barreras de acceso en los distintos grupos sociales, amén de la realización estudios ulteriores basados en la comparación de casos y el rastreo de procesos que pongan el acento en la combinación de los factores que explican la práctica deportiva.

This study examines gender disparities in social capital among job seekers using eighteen waves of the German Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS) and a novel causal decomposition approach (Yu &amp; Elwert 2025). We distinguish between access to social capital (available network resources), activation (received job search resources), and returns (outcomes such as wages, job satisfaction, and job interviews). While women in the general population have more limited access to weak ties and high-status contacts, these differences narrow substantially among active job seekers. Consistent with this pattern, women and men receive similar levels of network-based job search support.

We focus on physical activity as a potential mediator and whether changes in physical activity can explain how unemployment impairs health. Competing theoretical perspectives suggest that unemployment may either restrict or increase physical activity. We use thirteen waves of the German panel study \"Labor Market and Social Security\" (N_it = 57,124; N_i = 13,123) as well as fixed-effects models in combination with mediation analysis techniques. Based on time-distributed fixed effects models, we assess temporal dynamics. We find a negative total effect of unemployment on self-rated health (β = -0.063; p &lt; 0.01). At the same time, unemployment increases physical activity (β = 0.173; p &lt; 0.001) and physical activity positively affects health (β = 0.046; p &lt; 0.001). We also find a positive indirect effect (IE= 0.008; p &lt; 0.001) that partly counterbalances the negative unemployment effect—implying that the effect is 13 percent stronger net of physical activity. The indirect effects hold for all phases of unemployment. Physical activity suppresses part of the health deterioration associated with unemployment.

Despite decades of research, this central question in political economy remains unsettled. We advance this debate in two ways: by examining the effects of both positive and negative macroeconomic environments simultaneously, and by focusing on their cumulative impact over individuals’ lifetimes. We address this question by examining how lifetime exposure to periods of unusually high and low economic growth shapes political and economic attitudes in Latin America. We combine annual GDP per capita data from the Maddison Project (1896–2022) with nearly 700,000 individual responses from Latinobarómetro and LAPOP (1995–2021) to construct life-course measures of positive and negative periods for respondents in 18 countries. Our identification strategy compares cohorts within country–year using models with country, survey-year, age, cohort, and survey fixed effects. Repeated positive macroeconomic periods systematically shift individuals toward the right on a left–right scale and improve subjective economic evaluations. In contrast, repeated negative periods do not produce a consistent leftward shift; instead, they increase economic insecurity, dissatisfaction with democratic performance, and anti-elite sentiment. Support for democracy as a principle remains stable.

Conceptualizing global governance as a complex adaptive network, it theorizes crises as sequential mechanisms—rather than exogenous disruptions—that reconfigure institutional connections through three phases: trigger, framing struggle, and topological reconfiguration. The framework identifies four competing Governance Imperatives during crises—Efficiency, Security, Legitimacy, and Scientific Rationality— whose competitive prioritization shapes institutional responses. Drawing on the U.S. War on Terror, the Great Recession, and the COVID-19 pandemic, the analysis shows how security-driven pruning, institutional bypass, and crisis-induced fragmentation accumulate over time. These processes produce path-dependent erosion of coordination capacity despite growing institutional density. The article explains why contemporary global governance has become simultaneously more interconnected yet less governable: crisis cascades produce structural fragmentation rather than cyclical recovery, creating a 'topological trap' of stable fragmentation that undermines coordination capacity in an era of polycrisis.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6kau_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/g6kau_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0038532353104703265}, {"title": "Compositional and Scale Effects: How Foreign Direct Investment Shapes Informal Employment in Latin America, 2000-2018", "authors": "Ang Li", "abstract": "How does foreign direct investment (FDI) affect informal employment in the Global South?

We advance a “compositional framework” that links national labor market outcomes to distinct multinational corporate motivations: resource-seeking FDI creates enclave economies with limited local labor market integration; market-seeking FDI generates backward linkages that facilitate formalization; and efficiency-seeking FDI pursues labor cost arbitrage through flexible, informal employment arrangements. Using a novel dataset of 16 Latin American countries (2000-2018), we employ a relative-shift regression framework to isolate compositional effects from aggregate scale effects. Results reveal that, relative to market-seeking (service) investment, both resource-seeking (primary) and efficiency-seeking (manufacturing) FDI significantly increase informal employment, while aggregate net FDI inflows show no association with informality.

The study shows how SR made their public service obligation to remain distinct and actionable through a classificatory schema for metadata annotation that prescribed the production of radio news intended to evoke a sense of radiophonic authenticity – sonic expressions conveying place-specificity and presence. Post-deployment, reporters oriented their work toward producing such authenticity through less deskbound reporting and creative sonic practices.

Background: Drawing on structural symbolic interactionism and time-geographic perspectives, this study conceptualizes coparenting as a dyadic process in which role expectations are enacted within structurally constrained daily time. In this context, demanding work characteristics constitute a key structural constraint. Method: Using nationally representative 2009, 2014, and 2019 Korean Time Use Survey data of 758 dual-earner parents, we identified dyadic coparenting schedules using multichannel sequence and cluster analyses. Multinomial logistic regression and dyadic structural equation models assessed how couple-level work characteristics (work schedule irregularity, commute timing, and work hours) predicted coparenting schedules and how these schedules related to shared and individual well-being. Results: Five coparenting schedules emerged: mother-centered care with morning–evening peaks (47%), evening shared care (24%), mother-centered all-day care (12%), father-centered evening care (10%), and transition to shared care (7%). Shared caregiving clusters were more likely when wives worked longer, more irregular, or later schedules than husbands. These clusters reported lower shared time pressure and higher shared life satisfaction, with fathers benefiting beyond shared effects.

This paper proposes a novel theoretical framework—the Compression Wave—to explain this demographic-evolutionary paradox. Synthesizing longitudinal demographic data with cultural evolutionary theory, I argue that digital maturity acts as an environmental mismatch that hijacks evolved status-seeking heuristics. Drawing on Richerson and Boyd’s Big Mistake hypothesis and Henrich’s Collective Brain, I demonstrate how the shift from vertical (parent-to-child) to oblique and horizontal (teacher- and peer-driven) cultural transmission creates a Status Trap. In this trap, individuals are evolutionarily seduced into a runaway positional arms race for digital prestige, modeling their lives after childless teachers rather than fertile parents. This process results in the systematic unlearning of the domestic social operating system—the specific cultural heuristics required for low-friction child-rearing.

Although militarisation is frequently justified as a necessary response to crime threats that exceed conventional police capacities, its broader implications for democratic governance remain insufficiently examined. Drawing on theories of repression, environmental criminology, and Bourdieusian perspectives on police habitus, we argue that militarisation reshapes the organisational logics of coercive institutions by normalising power projection, intensifying threat perception, and weakening institutional and normative constraints on the use of lethal force. Using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) on a global country–year panel dataset, the analysis demonstrates that higher levels of militarisation are associated with increased rates of extrajudicial killings, even after controlling for governance capacity, economic conditions, and political violence. These findings suggest that militarisation constitutes a distinct dimension of state power, associated with weaker constraints on lethal force and with shifts away from legitimacy-based policing practices, potentially eroding due process and normalising the use of lethal force.

Yet most research analyzes commemorative narratives while paying limited attention to the events through which memory is enacted. We shift the focus to public war commemoration as an event-based practice that overlaps with contentious politics and social movements: commemorative gatherings are organized, recurrent, symbolically charged, and can function as state-led movements when used to advance government agendas. We ask: Why do autocratic states hold war commemoration events at higher rates in some localities than others? Drawing on scholarship on state-led movements and research on the political consequences of war, we develop two mechanisms. First, similar to other state-mobilized activities, commemorations depend on a regime’s social bases and organizational infrastructures and should be more frequent where such networks are stronger. Second, war studies show that war-affected communities—including veterans, martyrs’ families, and districts with high fatalities—remain politically consequential long after conflict, creating incentives for concentrated commemorative activity. We analyze Iran’s postwar mobilization following the Iran–Iraq War (1980–1988), a paradigmatic case of prolonged conflict and sustained state-led activism.

Drawing on Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray as a conceptual apparatus, I demonstrate that racism was not incidental to imperial violence but its operational foundation: permanent hereditary status, legal property designation, visible inherited marking, and moral justification that endured across centuries. African bodies and African land functioned as quarantined spaces where violence required for European and American 'civilisation' could be perfected, allowing metropolitan centres to maintain narratives of enlightenment, progress, and moral superiority. Through historical analysis of concentration camps, medical experimentation, bureaucratic genocide, and surveillance systems, I show that techniques perfected on Black bodies through this spatial and corporeal distribution are eventually deployed more broadly. The framework demonstrates how racism created an infrastructure within which powerful men could operate without constraint, refining techniques across generations through normalised administrative practice. Once operational, this machinery proved transferable beyond initial racial boundaries. Contemporary developments in the United States (2025-2026) provide empirical evidence that this containment mechanism is failing. The portrait splits, and violence previously confined through spatial and corporeal separation enters white metropolitan life.

The analysis combines classical panel data methodologies with machine learning techniques to check the robustness of the results and to detect regional latent patterns. In all models, namely, fixed effects, random effects, dynamic panel, and weighted least squares, it is confirmed that objective crime variables, as well as subjective ones, play a crucial role in determining PRC. In particular, it is confirmed that, among the variables, pickpocketing and fear of crime are the most important positive determinants of PRC, while trust in people and trust in the judiciary have a significant mitigating effect on PRC. Variables concerning pessimism about the future and environmental dissatisfaction are also confirmed to have a positive effect on PRC. Among several machine learning alternatives, the regularized linear regression model is selected as the best-performing predictive model, which provides an interpretable and accurate representation of the relationships between the variables. In addition, model-based clustering allows us to detect different regional profiles characterized by different combinations of crime, trust, well-being, and security perceptions.

We argue that without a critical framework, quantitative research risks perpetuating racial disparities by masking structural inequities, reinforcing deficit-based narratives, and legitimizing decisions that sustain oppression.

One promising strategy to address these challenges is to evaluate the trustworthiness of entire domains (source websites) as a proxy for content credibility. This approach demands methods that are both scalable and data-driven. However, current solutions such as NewsGuard and Media Bias/Fact Check (MBFC) rely on expert assessments, cover only a limited number of domains, and some (e.g., NewsGuard) require paid subscriptions. These constraints limit their usefulness for large-scale research. This study introduces a machine-learning-based system designed to assess the quality and trustworthiness of websites. We propose a data-driven approach that leverages a large dataset of expert-rated domains to predict credibility scores for previously unseen domains using domain-level features. Our supervised regression model achieves moderate performance on test data and high performance on independent datasets, highlighting its ability to generalize to unseen domains. Using feature importance analysis, we found that PageRank-based features provided the greatest reduction in prediction error, suggesting that link-based indicators play a central role in domain trustworthiness. This highlights the importance of highly referenced domains in reliable news dissemination. This approach can also help fact-checkers and social media platforms refine their credibility assessment strategies. The solution’s scalable design accommodates the continuously evolving nature of online content, ensuring that evaluations remain timely and relevant. The framework enables continuous assessment of thousands of domains with minimal manual effort. This capability allows stakeholders (social media platforms, media monitoring organizations, content moderators, and researchers) to allocate resources more efficiently, prioritize verification efforts, and reduce exposure to questionable sources. This approach could enable a more proactive and effective response to misinformation by helping stakeholders prioritize efforts, thus supporting robust public discourse and informed decision-making.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/eqf26_v2", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/eqf26_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.003769219078938346}, {"title": "The power of social influence on (non-)moral decision-making and its resistance: A scoping review of behavioral effects and neural mechanisms", "authors": "Leslie Tricoche, Emilie Caspar", "abstract": "While social influence has been extensively studied in psychology, neuroscientific research on how these processes are represented and regulated in the brain remains in its early stages and has rarely been systematically compared across studies.

Using original empirical data and a novel formal framework—the Probabilistic Article Acceptance Model (PAAM) and Editorial Blindness Index (EBI)—the study finds that 95.5% of IS and 92.3% of ISQ primary authors affiliate with Western institutions.

For these interviewees, HWFP can be an effective coping strategy for alleviating household food insecurity because it diversifies their food sources and allows for stockpiling non-market abundances. Yet, HWFP should not be mistaken for a coping strategy in the sense of an activity that households undertake only in response to hardship, because participants associated these activities with diverse, positive meanings such as joy, connection, and autonomy. The only negative aspects of HWFP that participants identified were challenges stemming from limited access to key resources needed for successful harvests, such as equipment, skills, and land access.

Evidence from User Switching on Mastodon", "authors": "Philipp Riederle", "abstract": "Users of centralised digital platforms (e.g., X, Instagram, TikTok) have little choice but to accept incumbent providers’ conduct or forgo participation. Digital platform interoperability is widely proposed as a remedy to reduce the economic and political power of centralised digital platforms by enabling user choice without sacrificing network connectivity. Despite its prominence in policy debates (e.g., EU’s Digital Markets Act, Art. 7), theoretical claims on its effects remain largely untested. This paper evaluates three theoretical expectations on platform interoperability: that it neutralises proprietary network effects; it facilitates individual user choice and switching; and that technical standardisation risks homogeneous services. To operationalise these concepts, this study analyses user switches within the interoperable social platform Mastodon. It draws on an unobtrusive, qualitative analysis of user posts documenting why individuals switched their interoperable providers. My findings qualify the theoretical promises and concerns: I find that interoperability is necessary but, on its own, insuﬀicient to achieve the intentions associated with policy proposals. I identify practical obstacles such as incomplete implementation, information costs, and persistent switching costs that preserve proprietary network effects and that hinder individual choice and switching. Further, I challenge the concern of anticipated service homogenisation. I identify avenues of vertical (e.g., quality) and horizontal (e.g., governance values) provider differentiation. These avenues form an emerging research agenda on new dynamics between differentiated but interoperable platform providers.

The Baloch insurgency in Pakistan has always been explained through security and economic-aid policies by the Pakistan government. However, by exploring the intersection of structural, cultural, and psychological forms of exclusion, it is claimed that the conflict is fueled by these intersections of identity. This paper combines the theories of misrecognition and maldistribution from the work of Nancy Fraser in 2003 and the moral injury construct of Axel Honneth from 1995 and asserts that structural policies of the Pakistan government are denying the Baloch people recognition as complete citizens with recognized identity. The proposed study makes use of a qualitative research approach in which descriptive and explanatory content analysis has been used to examine the socio-political reality of Balochistan. The study is limited by the fact that the research has no prime field accessibility due to the constraints imposed by security considerations, which may pose challenges of bias arising from state or secondary histories. To address the implication, triangulation is used in the study by referencing official statistics and other international human rights reports to provide a balanced view. The study has been conducted by using a purposive sample of secondary sources ranging from peer-reviewed academic literature to policy reports related to the 18th Amendment and CPEC projects, along with human rights statistics obtained from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP). The sources were considered as per their respective relevance to the twin paradigms of \"struggle for recognition\" and \"maldistribution.\" The period of investigation has been from accession in 1948 to modern development schemes. This paper derives its findings from a content analysis of already existing literature from 1948-2024 on the Baloch insurgency in Pakistan and includes the history of violence between the Baloch leaders and the central government of Pakistan and the \"moral injuries\" that are spurred by the exploitative use of Baloch Gas and Minerals by the Pakistani government. Through this change in focus, or paradigm shift, from simply addressing resource struggles to addressing struggles for dignity, this study shows that issues of economic and political justice are being used as primary wounds of invisibility and disrespect. Therefore, this study concludes that in order to pursue a justice-oriented path for eternal peace, there must be an understanding of the connected concepts of respect and recognition.

Institutional delegation and capital compounding reliably select a small minority into enforcement roles: the top 5 agents issue 67 to 92 percent of all punishment; endogenously appointed cadre members execute 92 to 98 percent. Two theoretically motivated retention mechanisms (sanctified suffering, membership reward) are inert across their full parameter ranges.

Using U.S. Agricultural Census data from 2012, 2017, and 2022 aggregated by farm size groupings within states, we compare the temporal changes in adoption of three water-related climate adaptation practices (cover crops, tile drainage, and irrigation) across small, medium and large farms, individually. Specifically, we provide estimates of the role of multiple government programs and climate changes in shaping heterogeneous climate adaptation behaviors across farm sizes. Applying multilevel models within a Bayesian framework, we show that temporal changes of government programs and climate conditions correlate with temporal changes in adoption differently across farm sizes. For small and medium farms, insurance participation associates positively with adoption of cover crops and irrigation. Among large farms, federal programs correlate negatively with irrigation, while state programs and insurance are positively associated with cover crops. These results suggest the opportunity to enhance cover crops among small and medium operations by improving the distribution of insurance and state programs, where small farms often have low participation. Alternatively, crop insurance, and not climate, might be the major driver of irrigation expansion among smaller farms as a way to increase productivity and reduce premium subsidies. Finally, small farms’ adoption of irrigation and tile drainage shows uncertain or negative correlations with changing and uncertain climate, implying that diseconomies of scale might be limiting their adoption; meanwhile, uncertainty of returns under climate changes is preventing farms of all sizes from growing cover crops, specifically in the West for large and medium farms, and the Eastern regions for small farms.

Rejesus, Meredith Niles", "abstract": "Despite cover crops been widely promoted for their on and off-farm benefits, their adoption is both low nationally and diminishing in some areas. Existing research has examined a suite of factors affecting the adoption of cover crops in the United States, yet understanding the role of multiple government programs and climate changes has not been fully investigated over time, especially across a national sample. Furthermore, the factors associated with cover crop disadoption have not yet been explored nationally. To fill these gaps in the literature, we combine multiple publicly available data sources to estimate the role of multiple government programs (i.e., crop insurance, state, conservation and working-lands programs) and weather and climate change conditions on county cover crop adoption and disadoption. First, we find that increasing crop insurance participation is associated with increasing cover crop adoption nationally and in the Midwest and Northeast, while increasing insurance premium subsidies are correlated with reduced cover crop adoption in the Midwest and increasing in the Southwest. Second, working-lands payments (including EQIP, CSP and commodity) are highly correlated with cover crop adoption in every region except the Northwest, although exclusively during the 2012-2017 period, when EQIP aggressively expanded cost-sharing cover crops. Third, cover crops might have been implemented as a climate-resilience strategy although constrained by a region’s particular agricultural system. For instance, increasing temperature variability is correlated with higher cover crop adoption in the Western regions, while water deficits are associated with more cover crops in the Midwest but lower cover crops in the Southeast. Finally, we quantify that 31% and 41% of counties had decreasing level of cover crops in 2017 and 2022, respectively, implying potential adoption saturation and concentration in fewer counties. Regionally, the probability of cover crop disadoption increases with land-retirement payments in the Northwest, insurance participation in the Southeast, and insurance subsidies in the Midwest, while it decreases with working-lands payments in the Midwest. We conclude that production risks from cover crop adoption could be potentially alleviated with the expansion of federal cost-sharing programs and crop insurance participation; yet the amount of premium subsidies should be assessed as possibly disincentivizing cover crops in the Midwest due to moral hazard triggers and risk-management redundancies under both practices.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/76djb_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/76djb_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.018893944643716076}, {"title": "Social Gradients in Medically Assisted Reproduction: Treatment Take-Up and Success Rates in Denmark, 2006–2023", "authors": "Simone Norlund VEring Johansen, Marco Cozzani, Peter Fallesen", "abstract": "While a growing body of research documents that women with high socio-economic status (SES) are more likely to give birth following medically assisted reproduction (MAR), fewer studies have investigated the processes that lead to this overrepresentation.

However, many disciplines, including management and organizational research (MOR), remain far from this ideal.

The findings reveal growing authorship inequalities and a more noticeable dominance of a scientific elite. At the individual level, a small group of researchers has accumulated disproportionate influence over time. IOP, in particular, shows more skewed disparities, with its most productive scholars publishing significantly more than those in MNGT and HRM. Moreover, IOP shows a higher recurrence of the same authors in the top-10 most-published lists across journals, indicating more pronounced elite dominance.

This indicates that the USL second saccade uses visual information obtained before the first saccade and corrects the erroneous decision to make the first saccade to the distractor. Here, we demonstrate that such USL second saccades also often occur when monkeys perform active visual search without a popout visual target. Unlike in prior studies where the search target was extremely salient and therefore all second saccades showed a high accuracy towards the target, in our task, we show that USL saccades are preferentially directed towards the search-target and the transfer of target selection and location information across the first saccade is very accurate. USL saccades foveate the target more often than regular-latency saccades especially when the saccade starts far away from the target. We demonstrate various properties of USL saccades that reveal how the error-correction process is very accurate and how concurrent processing of saccade goals may proceed on the basis of computations in visual/oculomotor priority maps. Our results expand our understanding of saccadic targeting and information transfer across saccades during goal-directed active vision, lay the ground for future neurophysiological studies, and suggest that error-processing in different sensory and response modalities show similar patterns and may be accounted for by similar models.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/vt423_v3", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/vt423_v3", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009377067266880035}, {"title": "Psychometric properties of the French athlete version of the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (Fr-CART-Q)", "authors": "Valentin Roux, David Trouilloud", "abstract": "Two studies were conducted to examine the psychometric properties of the French athlete version of the Coach-Athlete Relationship Questionnaire (Fr-CART-Q) among two independent samples of French athletes.

This review therefore sought to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of driving support interventions for autistic people. Methods: We conducted a multimethod, participatory synthesis of evidence. Studies were obtained from Medline, Social Policy and Practice, ASSIA, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Scopus and Epistemonikos. Data were extracted from those that implemented a driving support intervention with autistic people. No specifications on study design, outcomes, or comparators were made. Risk of bias was appraised using the Cochrane ROB and ROBINS tools (for controlled quantitative studies), as well as the EPPI-Centre (for qualitative studies) and NHLBI (for other uncontrolled studies) quality tools. The application and effectiveness of support interventions were narratively synthesised, while focal delivery components and mechanisms of action were examined using realist synthesis. All analyses were co-produced and developed by autistic adults. Results: Only 17 relevant studies (involving 402 autistic participants) were identified, which utilised varying designs and were generally appraised to be low in quality. The most well-researched form of support was simulation training, however e-learning applications, anti-anxiety medication, listening to music, and cognitive-behavioural programmes were also studied. Although positive results were documented for all interventions, at least in some form, assessments typically consisted of simulated driving tests and various contextual factors were overlooked. Specific delivery components were identified from the effective support programmes, but evidence was lacking with regards to intervention mechanisms. Conclusion: Our participatory syntheses of data highlight that research is urgently required to address the driving barriers and challenges faced by autistic people. Despite promising but inconclusive evidence for simulation training and holistic cognitive-behavioural programmes, widespread limitations are evident in existing studies and rigorous, generalisable intervention assessments are lacking.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/vfk4g_v3", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/vfk4g_v3", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011889849088545068}, {"title": "A Complexity-Informed Methodology for Interdisciplinary Dialogues: Key Questions and Challenges for Theory, Research and Practice on Modes of Thinking (In) Complexity", "authors": "Ana Teixeira de Melo, Leo Simon Dominic Caves, Charbel N.

The workshop adopted a collaborative and dialogical approach organised by a methodology grounded in a theoretical framework for the practice of complex thinking. The methodology was designed to support complex relational dialogues and facilitate emergence (e.g. of new ideas; approaches; levels of understanding; solutions) in the collective discussion.

Although residents of disadvantaged urban communities report more stress, within-person effects on crime remain near-zero. These findings validate sociological stress process theories for mental health outcomes while raising questions about criminological claims that stress causes crime.

Indigenous religious and spiritual traditions, in particular, have had significant impacts on popular belief in the paranormal and supernatural. For example, Indigenous phenomena such as skinwalkers and wendigos have become objects of paranormal research and investigation by non-Indigenous people in recent years. While it is common practice for non-Indigenous people to group these and similar phenomena under the banners of cryptids or mythical beings, in many Indigenous communities, such phenomena are seen as spirit beings who are able to move between the natural and supernatural worlds, realms, and/or dimensions, often at will and with purpose or reason. Pennsylvania has a long and rich Indigenous presence and history, in particular with communities connected to the Lenape (Delaware), Haudenosaunee (Iroquois), and Saawanooki (Shawnee) nations. Paranormal and supernatural phenomena connected to these and other Indigenous peoples are still thriving today throughout the Commonwealth. In particular, there are four Indigenous phenomena of religious and spiritual significance – Bigfoot, Little People, Thunderbirds, and the Machtando. In this paper, we discuss the Indigenous origins and histories of these four phenomena, as well as the roles they play in contemporary paranormal and supernatural traditions in Pennsylvania.

This study examined how arts engagement as a health behaviour clusters with other health behaviours, including physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and social media use, and across countries. We analysed data from the Global Flourishing Study, comprising 123,847 adults from 22 countries and territories, using latent profile analysis. Four health behaviour profiles were identified: Low risk, At risk, Mixed, and Disengaged, with arts engagement tending to co-occur with other health-promoting behaviours.

Some country differences in the distribution of health behaviours within clusters were found and the proportion of the clusters also varied across country. Exploring predictors of the identified clusters revealed clear social inequalities in health behaviour patterns, with the strength of the gradients differing by country income level. These findings suggest that arts engagement is a behaviour distinct from other health behaviours, yet one that frequently co-occurs alongside other low-risk behaviours.

Defensive rigidity and adaptive flexibility are reframed as alternative configurations of precision dynamics rather than distinct psychological capacities. Dysregulation arises when prediction errors are weighted inflexibly, whereas resilience emerges from coordinated recalibration across hierarchical levels.
