Who is best positioned to benefit, and what are the political consequences for “left behind” areas? We argue that primarily advantaged groups seize these opportunities through internal migration toward centers of global production—a costly activity not everyone can undertake. This selective out‐migration creates demographic shifts in left‐behind areas, weakening public goods provision. We test our argument in India, first documenting selective internal migration of advantaged groups. We then leverage the Indian information technology (IT) export boom and explore its consequences for public goods provision. We find that the IT boom increased migration toward centers of production and away from left‐behind localities. We also find that public goods provision was relatively weaker in unexposed localities, especially geographically distant ones. We identify migration as a mechanism through which globalization drives political change even in unexposed areas.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70029", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70029", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9692360091066399}, {"title": "Do Donors Punish Extremist Primary Nominees?

This article combines an original candidate ideology scaling with a regression discontinuity design in primary elections in Congress, 1980–2022, and state legislatures, 1996–2022, to assess whether donors punish extremist nominees in general elections. I find that the “coin-flip” primary nomination of an extremist over a more moderate opponent decreases their party’s share of general-election contributions by 7 percentage points in the median contest and 18–19 percentage points when the ideological contrast between candidates is largest. This financial penalty is larger among corporate PACs than individual donors and is driven symmetrically by donors withdrawing support from extremist nominees and rallying behind their opponents. Applying a complementary panel-based identification strategy, I replicate these core findings and further document that the financial penalty to extremist nominees has fallen by nearly half since 2000. Overall, these results show how general-election donors act as a marked, yet waning, moderating force in American politics when parties run extremist candidates.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s000305542510138x", "doi": "10.1017/s000305542510138x", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007347995376170924}, {"title": "The Hidden Cost of Tax Regressivity at the Top", "authors": "David Hope, Julian Limberg, Lukas Haffert", "abstract": "How does tax regressivity at the top affect public support for taxation?

We show that these determinants have partly different effects on whether any non-partisans are appointed to cabinets and on their magnitude. Direct presidential elections increase the likelihood, but not the magnitude, of non-partisan appointments, and a president’s power to dissolve parliament increases both likelihood and magnitude.

Our results suggest that the adoption of milking machines broke up allocative inefficiencies associated with moving costs across sectors, which improved the economic status of women relative to men.

This study examines the reactions of American and German YouTube users to issues of migration and immigration by focusing on user comments through thematic and discourse analysis. The thematic analysis identified five dominant themes in both contexts: security concerns, economic impacts, cultural and identity issues, political blame or radicalization, and humanitarian perspectives. While American users emphasized border security, illegal migration, labor market competition, and leader-centered blame, German users focused on systemic crises, welfare debates, and radical political solutions. Discourse analysis revealed a polarized “us versus them” rhetoric in both countries. American comments frequently employed metaphors of illegality, invasion, and economic burden, often tied to partisan blame and leader references (e.g., Trump, Biden). German discourse more strongly associated migration with terrorism, crime, and loss of state control, often echoing far-right rhetoric and showing higher prevalence of hate speech. Overall, while both societies share concerns over security, economy, and identity, their discursive constructions differ. The U.S. discourse frames migration as an immediate and partisan issue, whereas German discourse positions it as a systemic crisis and cultural conflict.

This article examines remittance practices of North Korean defectors in South Korea, who, despite being isolated from their country of origin, continue to remit. We conceptualize North Korean defectors as isolated migrants who have extremely low possibilities of visiting or returning home and face great difficulties when communicating with their family members. Inspired by scholarship that examines the social meaning of remittances for the migrants, we argue that the isolation from the country of origin has the effect of highlighting the affective and moral dimensions of remittances for the individual migrants. Through in-depth interviews with 24 defectors in South Korea, we illustrate how remittances serve as retainers of relationship, allowing defectors to maintain family ties. Remitting also helps to resolve the feeling of “sin” that comes with leaving their family in North Korea. These meanings evolve into affective and moral pressures for North Korean defectors, who respond by prioritizing short-term incomes for remittances over long-term investments to aid their resettlement in South Korea.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251405861", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251405861", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.951223481056773}, {"title": "Global Inequalities in US Visa Rejections: Evidence from Visitor Visa Applications Submitted Between 2006 and 2021", "authors": "Kevin J.

The results showed that between 2006 and 2021, visitor visa rejection rates were higher for applications submitted in the Global South than in the Global North. For example, the top 15 countries with the lowest rejection rates were mostly wealthy states in the Middle East and Europe. On the contrary, two-thirds of the top 15 countries with the highest rejection rates were in Africa. Results from mixed-effects regression models indicated that visa rejection rates in Africa were more than double those in Europe. These differences were not explained by disparities in economic, demographic, and social factors. Sensitivity tests further suggested that regional disparities were not explained by higher visa overstay rates in non-European than in European countries. Additionally, the results showed that there were differential patterns of responses to visa approvals across regions. In Africa, increases in visa approvals were followed by increases in visa rejections the following year. However, increases in visa approvals elsewhere, especially in Europe, were followed by decreases in visa rejection s. Overall, the study demonstrates that visas regulate migration in ways that make it more difficult for people in the Global South than the Global North to enjoy the benefits associated with travelling to the United States.

This study analyzes the manifestation of postmemory and the associated emotional responses to the 1989 Romanian Revolution among young people in Timișoara, the city where the uprising began. Drawing on the frameworks of lieu de mémoire and collective memory, the research explores how this historical event, which involves affective spaces and transmitted narratives, is internalized by Generations Y and Z. We employed two brief Q‐surveys conducted during the Revolution's commemorative periods in 2019 and 2024, with emotions analyzed using an adapted version of Plutchik's Wheel and Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). The findings indicate that youth postmemory is characterized by symbolic empathy, with dominant emotions being sadness, solidarity, and gratitude. While the 2019 analysis found no significant overall emotional differences between Generations Y and Z, the 2024 model for Generation Z revealed that family involvement significantly inhibited anger, decreasing the likelihood of reporting it. These results confirm that memory experience is stratified by contextual and familial factors and provide a novel generational comparison of postmemory emotions concerning the 1989 Revolution. The study underscores the necessity of continuous monitoring to prevent the deterioration of this crucial collective memory. The findings demonstrate that postmemory is an inherited coping strategy that facilitates Generation Z's conscious and functional engagement with a complex historical legacy, rather than succumbing to passive emotional burdens.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70174", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70174", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01863632982312624}, {"title": "Drivers of Return Plans Among Ukrainian War Refugees in Czechia: Challenging Common Assumptions and Refining the Theory", "authors": "Josef Novotný, Anna Levkova, Dušan Drbohlav, Jiří Hasman", "abstract": "This article examines return plans of forcibly displaced persons from Ukraine in Czechia, which has one of the highest relative shares of Ukrainian refugees in population.

Findings challenge the assumption that return plans decline naturally with time and integration. Instead, shifts in perceived control over return drive individual‐level changes over time, while social norms, particularly family pressures, strongly influence cross‐sectional variations. These psychosocial drivers and return plans are shaped more by attachment to Ukraine (emotional, social, identity‐related and material) than by integration levels or hardships in Czechia, including policy restrictions on refugees' well‐being.

This study employs a big data‐integrated approach to empirically confirm that urban regeneration in Beijing significantly contributes to gentrification, yet the impacts vary notably across different implementing entities. Projects implemented by governments and local government financing platforms (LGFPs) generally show minimal gentrification effects, suggesting stronger protection of public interests in urban regeneration. In contrast, market‐oriented projects lack effective mechanisms to achieve equity goals. Regeneration‐induced gentrification exhibits a concentric spatial pattern, with its impacts being stronger within the Sixth Ring Road than in peripheral suburban areas. However, within the innermost core area (within the Third Ring Road), urban regeneration tends to suppress gentrification, reflecting the government's policy orientation and the involvement of public capital in promoting public welfare and reducing population density in the city's core.

Drawing on semi‐structured interviews with 30 migrants, the analysis traces three interconnected phases of migration: the decision to relocate and adaptation, the adjustment to everyday life in the new setting, and the efforts to establish spatial permanence. Migration was found to be motivated by dissatisfaction with metropolitan life, including the increasing densities, socially disconnected lifestyles, long and exhausting commutes, and limited access to open spaces. Relocation decisions were noted to be driven by pre‐migration imaginaries centred on autonomy and proximity to nature, shaping both the expectations and post‐migration practices of the respondents. Many of the respondents reported improvements in time management, mobility and social interactions, as well as easier and more frequent engagement with natural environments. Yet these positive experiences were offset by such challenges as rising housing costs, limited infrastructure, seasonal fluctuations and uneven integration. Efforts to attain spatial permanence were therefore marked by uncertainty. Only a few of the respondents were actively considering moving again, while many remained undecided, suggesting that permanence is conditional rather than assured. This ambivalence intersects with a broader paradox: as the appeal of nature‐oriented lifestyles grows, former desirable rural destinations begin to experience densification and urbanisation.

Using longitudinal data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), we find that internet use facilitates long‐distance inter‐provincial migration, a result robust to individual fixed effects and instrumental variable estimations. In contrast, no significant effect is observed for short‐distance inter‐county migration. Further analyses show that the duration of internet use has a positive non‐linear effect on inter‐provincial migration with diminishing marginal effects. Moreover, the impact of different online activities is also heterogeneous: frequent engagement in socializing and entertainment activities significantly facilitates inter‐provincial migration, while study, work, and e‐transaction activities show no significant impact. Consistent with this, latent class analysis (LCA) of respondents’ internet use behaviors indicates that the latent class, “work users”, shows no significant difference from non‐internet users on migration, whereas “hyper‐users”, “leisure users”, and “inactive‐users” exhibit a significantly higher likelihood of migrating. Finally, the analysis of potential channels elucidates how internet use influences migration through information acquisition and the strengthening of family ties.

Within complex food webs, ecological theory predicts that nonhuman consumers can maintain more stable consumption rates by foraging on multiple resources that vary asynchronously in their availability across space and time. These so-called portfolio effects may also sustain more stable harvest rates by humans in wild food systems. We analyzed wild food harvest patterns for 46 isolated rural communities in southern coastal Alaska that harvest a diversity of wild foods (96 taxa) across terrestrial, freshwater, intertidal, and marine habitats. We show that access to diverse wild foods across this heterogeneous landscape dampened variability in harvest through time and increased robustness to species declines by allowing communities to harness seasonal and interannual asynchronies in wild food availability. These results demonstrate how ecological mechanisms that stabilize ecosystems may also underpin the stability of human wild food systems. Managing landscapes to maintain access to diverse wild foods and adopting flexible governance that allows communities to adjust harvest as patterns of wild food availability shift through time are crucial to sustaining resilient wild food systems in a changing world.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525571122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2525571122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.017370053260867713}, {"title": "Competition for heritable wealth, not cultural group selection, drives the evolution of monogamy", "authors": "Gabriel Šaffa, Adrian V.

Competing explanations suggest that monogamy either i) reduces reproductive inequality, fosters cooperation, and enhances success in intergroup competition, or ii) mitigates conflict over heritable wealth—especially land—under conditions of high social stratification and ecological constraints. Both frameworks are influenced by the history of Indo-European societies, where monogamy has long been normative and closely associated with land inheritance and state formation. However, normative monogamy is also found in many societies beyond this historical context. To evaluate these competing hypotheses, we formalized their causal structure and applied Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models to a global sample of 186 societies. Our results show that monogamy is strongly associated with land privatization and, in some regions, with ecological or demographic proxies for land scarcity—supporting the view that competition over heritable wealth promotes monogamy globally. In contrast, support for the intergroup competition model is inconsistent: While it may explain monogamy in some language families, these dynamics do not extend to most societies in our sample.

Investigating Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) government (2015–23), this article reveals how PoGos manage sectoral conflicts within the growth coalition of businesses and voters. The findings reveal that PoGos tailor governance modes based on the intensity of sectoral conflicts. In the financial policy domain, where conflict was low, PiS centralized governance to nationalize the financial system.

We argue that regulators strategically define access, consultation, and debate to maximize preference attainment.

However, research has yet to investigate if a newer form of division—affective polarization, or citizens’ hostility toward opposing party members—shapes major polluters’ carbon (CO 2 ) emissions. Building on the Advocacy Coalition Framework, integrated with neo-institutional and stakeholder perspectives, we argue that high levels of affective polarization enable power plants to emit greenhouse gases at a higher rate than those operating in less polarized contexts. To test our argument, we analyze a novel dataset of over 20,000 power plants in 92 democratic countries. Controlling for conventional predictors of emissions, we find that power plants in democracies marked by high affective polarization emit CO 2 at significantly higher rates. Also, in contexts of heightened interparty hostility, government-owned power stations emit more carbon, climate policies are less effective at curbing plants’ emissions, and plants pollute more where strong political constraints susceptible to gridlock are in place. These results are robust across different modeling specifications, suggesting that partisan animosity likely creates institutional conditions that insulate power plants from stakeholder and regulatory pressure, thereby undermining democracies’ ability to limit emissions from some of the world’s largest carbon polluters.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251396518", "doi": "10.1177/00031224251396518", "journal_full": "American Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014350684315997952}, {"title": "Seeing Like a Company or a Customer: Selective Empathy in Pricing", "authors": "Barbara Kiviat, Carly R.

In this article, we draw on three survey studies to examine Americans’ moral beliefs about risk-based pricing, a pricing institution in which consumers who are predicted to be costly are charged more. In markets for both insurance and consumer loans, we uncover a pattern in which higher-income individuals are consistently more likely than lower-income individuals to accept the moral legitimacy of tethering prices to a person’s behavior, irrespective of economic self-interest or ideology. To explain this pattern, we introduce a novel theoretical lens we term “selective empathy”—that is, in evaluating pricing arrangements, individuals disproportionately direct their empathy to one exchange partner or the other, taking the perspective of either the company or the customer. We find that wealthier individuals are more likely than lower-income individuals to empathize with companies—and less likely to empathize with high-risk consumers.

Prior empirical research suggests two possibilities. In the first, financialization facilitates economic growth and intensifies the Treadmill of Production, thereby increasing emissions. In the second, financialization enables renewable energy deployment and dampens emissions, consistent with Ecological Modernization theory. I leverage more recent sociological and economic literature on financialization to hypothesize a third possibility, in which financialization adversely affects economic growth, which translates to lower levels of emissions. To test this hypothesis, I estimate mediation models with lagged dependent variables and country and time fixed effects. I use multiple measures for financialization and a panel dataset of 34 high-income country members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 1995–2020. There are two main findings. First, GDP per capita mediates the financialization–emissions relationship when financialization is measured as private sector credit and by the International Monetary Fund’s Financial Development Index. Specifically, there is an inverted U-curve relationship between financialization and GDP per capita. The latter is, in turn, positively associated with CO2 emissions. Second, renewable energy deployment does not mediate the financialization–emissions relationship: there is no significant relationship between any measure of financialization and renewable energy deployment, although the latter is negatively associated with emissions. The findings suggest that financialization can lead to a reduction in CO2 emissions through its unintended destabilizing impact on the economy while having limited impacts on renewable energy deployment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf220", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf220", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014599932752750289}, {"title": "How Incumbency Shapes Electoral Competitiveness in Ranked-Choice Voting", "authors": "Yuki Atsusaka, Silviya Valeva, Agustin Vallejo", "abstract": "We provide the first systematic analysis of electoral competitiveness in American ranked-choice voting (RCV) elections.

It advances the claim that shortage signals are partly institutional outputs: they arise when screening rules narrow the effective labour pool, rather than reflecting exogenous skill scarcity. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on labour market segmentation, information economics, and critical institutionalism, we analyse 10,432 job advertisements scraped monthly (January 2024–June 2025) from leading portals in seven Anglophone African countries. A rigorously validated support-vector-machine classifier distinguishes explicit numeric age ceilings from implicit youth-coded cues to construct an Age-Coded Hiring Index (ACHI). We triangulate ACHI with employer-reported workforce-constraint indicators from the World Bank Enterprise Surveys and labour-underutilisation (LU4) from ILOSTAT, estimating fixed-effects and interaction models to test whether age-coded screening predicts shortage complaints most strongly where latent labour supply is greatest. Findings: Age-coded screening is pervasive in vacancy texts: approximately 15–20% of postings impose numeric age caps and a much larger share deploys implicit youth signals. Higher ACHI is robustly associated with stronger shortage complaints net of underutilisation and macro controls, and the relationship steepens under high labour slack, consistent with an institutional mechanism in which screening rules convert latent labour supply into perceived scarcity. Originality/value: Conceptually, the paper reframes “shortage” indicators as partially endogenous to screening rules and to employers’ definition of “suitability,” rather than treating them as market facts. Empirically, it introduces a replicable NLP-based measure of exclusionary screening from vacancy text, enabling cross-country tests of institutional scarcity dynamics in low- and middle-income contexts.

Using unit-level data from the Time Use Survey (TUS) 2024 for Uttar Pradesh (50,532 individuals across 11,186 households), linked with district-level Gross District Domestic Product (GDDP) and NFHS-5 indicators, the study analyses how time use shapes effective labour availability and productivity. The evidence reveals a pronounced gendered asymmetry in time allocation. Men average roughly three hours of paid work per day alongside substantial discretionary time, while women devote nearly five hours daily to unpaid domestic and care work, with an unpaid-to-paid work ratio exceeding 8:1. Educational attainment does not reallocate women’s time toward market work, indicating near-zero elasticity of female paid work with respect to education. At the district level, aggregate economic output (GDDP) shows no systematic association with reductions in unpaid care time, whereas basic infrastructure, particularly sanitation and electricity, is modestly associated with lower unpaid work burdens. These findings indicate that apparent labour surplus in Uttar Pradesh coexists with effective time scarcity, and that the productive impact of labour, education, and capital is mediated by time allocation. The paper argues that growth models overstate factor availability when time is treated as a residual, and demonstrates empirically how time conditions the translation of conventional inputs into economic output.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jf2qz_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jf2qz_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0099059547914363}, {"title": "Highdigenous Pedagogy: Aesthetic Engagement as Epistemological Bridge in African Learning Communities", "authors": "Yanick Kemayou", "abstract": "Sub-Saharan Africa faces a structural youth employment crisis: 10–12 million young people enter the workforce annually while only 3 million formal jobs are created, leaving 77–85% in informal employment. Conventional responses, such as expanding formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) or adopting Northern skills frameworks, have produced disappointing results. This paper introduces highdigenous pedagogy, an approach that synthesizes high-technology capabilities with indigenous knowledge systems through aesthetic engagement. Drawing on mixed-methods analysis of 504 learner portfolio entries and task reflections from 122 participants at Kabakoo Academies in Bamako, Mali (2023–2025), we examine how aesthetic scaffolding, i.e. using learners’ existing aesthetic sensibilities as foundations for capability development, operates in practice. Quantitative lexical analysis reveals that aesthetic discourse functions across multiple registers: design vocabulary dominates task artifacts, while portfolio entries emphasize cultural grounding and self-work. Cluster analysis identifies six discourse families, with one embodying the cultural-technological synthesis central to highdigenous pedagogy. Qualitative analysis reveals three mechanisms through which aesthetic scaffolding operates: epistemological legitimation, cultural-technological synthesis, and dignified aspiration formation. These findings extend ethnocomputing scholarship by demonstrating how aesthetic engagement enables synthesis between indigenous knowledge systems and digital capabilities, and provide empirical support for recent reconceptualizations of culturally responsive pedagogy in African contexts as fundamentally concerned with decolonization through heritage restoration.

A la luz de la literatura internacional, estas transferencias se examinan como parte de estrategias de aproximación e influencia sobre los prescriptores: estudios observacionales indican asociaciones – a menudo inconscientes – entre la recepción de beneficios y una mayor prescripción de productos de las empresas pagadoras, una mayor participación de medicamentos de marca en detrimento de los genéricos, la promoción de productos con beneficio clínico marginal y el incremento de costos en los sistemas de salud.

MRT is positioned as conscious landscape, which is a description that is very specific to the characteristics of strong economic map in human brain.

The results indicate that meeting with a coach, counselor, or college representative significantly increase students’ likelihood of enrolling in a four-year college, whereas meeting with a teacher has no such effect. Counselors and college representatives also positively impact enrollment in two-year or less-than-two-year institutions, though the effects are smaller than those for four-year enrollment.

Drawing on my dual position as a decision-making scholar and a patient with complex chronic illness, I argue that epistemic humility must be reframed not merely as a virtue but as a professional obligation in clinical communication. The paper makes three contributions: (1) it conceptualizes epistemic humility as an ethical duty to distinguish clearly between knowledge, inference, and intuition in medical discourse; (2) it introduces and theorizes epistemic confidence as a socially reinforced but ethically problematic communicative norm; and (3) it uses autoethnographic insights to expose how even documented, institutionally validated diagnoses are routinely dismissed in favor of more familiar narratives. Through philosophical argument, empirical literature, and lived experience, I show how epistemic confidence under uncertainty can obscure diagnostic alternatives, undermine informed consent, and perpetuate epistemic injustice. Even after years of seeking care, patients with complex conditions routinely encounter well-meaning physicians who confidently offer alternative diagnoses, sometimes contradicting existing evidence, without acknowledging the limits of their expertise.

We find that social characteristics pattern views of effectiveness but not disruptiveness. Our research highlights the need to understand how perceptions of effective and disruptive protest are analytically distinct, shaped by tactical dimensions and the diverse publics perceiving them, and holds implications for how tactics may be perceived as legitimate.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w59h3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/w59h3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010250944972808651}, {"title": "METAPHORICAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF PATERNITY FRAUD IN SELECTED NIGERIAN NEWSPAPER REPORTS", "authors": "Tolulope Akinseye, Ngozi V. Bolarinwa", "abstract": "Paternity fraud has emerged as a prominent media theme in Nigeria, reflecting deep-seated social anxieties surrounding trust, masculinity, gender relations, and family integrity. This study examines how Nigerian newspaper discourse constructs paternity fraud through conceptual metaphors, drawing on eighteen articles from nine major national newspapers published between 2015 and 2024. Guided by Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) Conceptual Metaphor Theory, as further developed by Kövecses (2010), this study identifies seven dominant metaphorical patterns through which paternity fraud is represented and evaluated in Nigerian media discourse. Collectively, these metaphors construct paternity fraud as a concealed but discoverable truth, a strategic act of deception, a socially contagious threat, and a force that inflicts both gradual and catastrophic harm on individuals, families, and social trust. The study concludes that Nigerian newspaper discourse relies heavily on metaphor to moralise paternity fraud, foreground male victimhood, and legitimise emotional collapse, relational breakdown, and violent response as natural or inevitable outcomes of paternity uncertainty.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wea7v_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wea7v_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010487731304807513}, {"title": "Asymmetric Vessel Signs in the Indus Script symbolizing copper smelting crucibles, signifying copper and bronze related meanings — epigraphic, archaeological, and linguistic evidence", "authors": "Bahata Ansumali Mukhopadhyay", "abstract": "Despite more than a century of research, much of the Indus script remains undeciphered. Building on previous work that interprets the Indus script as a semasiographic/logographic writing system used for commercial administration, this article examines a group of neglected asymmetric vessel-shaped signs and proposes that they depict copper-smelting crucibles. Through a multi-pronged methodology integrating graphemic analysis of the Indus script signs, cross-script comparison, archaeological context, script-internal positional analysis, linguistic symbolism, and sign co-occurrence patterns, the study argues that these signs signified refined copper or bronze, copper ingots, and copper-smelting or metalworking activities. The proposed identification is supported by close visual parallels with wedge-shaped crucibles known from the ancient Near East, which inspired Egyptian hieroglyphs used for copper and bronze, as well as by archaeological contexts from Chanhu-daro associated with metalworking. The consistent occurrence of these signs in core informational segments of Indus inscriptions further supports their interpretation as commodity or craft names within taxation and licensing systems.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6mb39_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/6mb39_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01813027181236926}, {"title": "\"A Pretty Blunt Approach\": Meta's Political Content Reduction Policy and Italian Parliamentarians' Facebook Visibility", "authors": "Fabio Giglietto", "abstract": "In February 2021, Meta announced it would reduce the distribution of political content in users' News Feeds, implementing the policy globally by July 2022 before reversing course in January 2025. Despite the significance of these changes for democratic communication, no independent research has quantified their effects on elected officials. This study examines Meta's political content reduction policy using a dataset of over 2.5 million Facebook posts from Italian parliamentarians, prominent politicians, and political extremist accounts spanning 2021–2025, collected via the Meta Content Library API. Employing a discovery-validation design with structural breakpoint detection methods, the analysis identifies three cross-validated breakpoints that reveal policy effects emerged in Italy approximately ten months before Meta's announced global implementation. The findings document a 72% reduction in average reach for re-elected Members of Parliament, declining from approximately 53,000 views per post before the policy to 15,000 at the trough. Although Meta's January 2025 reversal produced a significant rebound, post-reversal reach recovered to only 65% of pre-policy levels. A robustness check reveals asymmetric effects: while mainstream politicians experienced substantial visibility losses, extremist accounts' high posting volume more than compensated for modest per-post declines, resulting in increased total weekly reach during the policy period. These findings expose significant transparency deficits in Meta's policy communication while also demonstrating the research value of the transparency infrastructure that made this study possible.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8dqag_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8dqag_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007609140613480281}, {"title": "The Potential Role of African Ethics in the K-Ricebelt Project based on the Impact of Traditional Confucian Ethics in Korea’s Saemaul Undong Movement", "authors": "Helena Hahyoon Kim", "abstract": "Inspired by the rapid success and development during the Korean Green Revolution, the K-Ricebelt Project, led by South Korea is a promising collaborative effort for agricultural modernization, increased food production, and economic self-sufficiency in African countries (Senegal, Gambia, Ghana, Cameroon, Uganda, Kenya and Guinea) by implementing high-yielding and climate-resilient rice strains.

Program evaluation methods have proven helpful for retrospectively examining intervention efficacy; however, there is a lack of standardized methods to jointly assess intervention-period outcomes and post-intervention prevention practice durability with respect to program characteristics. The absence of such an evaluation instrument limits comparative inference and represents a gap in contemporary prevention science. Objectives: To develop and propose a standardized, theory-informed, multi-component program evaluation tool that facilitates systematic assessment of intervention-phase attrition and post-intervention behavior sustainability, while incorporating key program design, implementation, and equity characteristics to enable comparative synthesis across heterogeneous interventions. Methods: The Longitudinal Prophylactic Capacity Evaluation (LPCE) Tool was developed through analytic abstraction of prevailing evaluation constructs used in lifestyle prevention research, with explicit emphasis on participant retention, behavioral durability, and real-world implementation feasibility. LPCE evaluates prevention programs as the unit of analysis, using six ordinally scored domains: (1) Intervention-period attrition; (2) Post-intervention behavior sustainability; (3) Intervention design and behavioral framework fidelity; (4) Engagement and participant-resonance strategies; (5) Implementation and scalability; and (6) Equity and accessibility considerations. Domain scores are synthesized into two standardized indices: (1) A Composite Program Score (CPS), which applies equal domain weights; and (2) A Weighted Program Score (WPS), which prioritizes sustainability domain influence through differential weighting and a durability-based gate rule. LPCE then normalizes domain scores for subsequent integration into a heatmap-based visualization to support transparent, pattern-based comparative analysis. Results: LPCE will facilitate reproducible, interpretable program-level performance profiles that distinguish interventions that achieve only short-term engagement from those that demonstrate durable post-intervention behavior maintenance. The sustainability-weighted scoring structure prevents inflation of overall program performance in the absence of post-intervention durability, while the domain-level heatmap approach facilitates cross-program comparisons and identifies design and implementation features associated with sustained outcomes. Conclusions: The LPCE Tool provides a standardized, extensible framework for evaluating the longitudinal prophylactic capacity of lifestyle prevention programs. By explicitly integrating attrition, sustainability, behavioral design, implementation feasibility, and equity considerations into a unified evaluation system, LPCE addresses a critical methodological gap.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jwbnm_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jwbnm_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006163689408024586}, {"title": "The Functional-Actor Transition Dilemma: A Structural Explanation for Post-Intervention Attenuation in Prevention Programs", "authors": "Jason Kreger", "abstract": "Despite sustained investment in lifestyle prevention programs, many interventions demonstrate limited post-intervention sustainability, with behavior or practice adherence commonly declining upon withdrawal of external program support. This pattern reflects a persistent structural limitation in prevention science, whereby participants remain functionally dependent on continued programmatic actuation for behavioral continuity rather than transitioning into autonomous agents for preventive actions. This phenomenon is mediated by interventional prevention models prioritizing delivery-phase implementation and near-term outcomes, while under-theorizing the psychosocial and operational processes required for enduring behavior maintenance following program termination. Numerous existing frameworks and theories directly consider and aim to increase participant shareholding of preventive behaviors, yet in practice, there remains a gap between who is left with ownership of these behaviors or practices at the end of an intervention. To address this gap and stimulate intentional progress within prevention science around this gap, this manuscript formally identifies and articulates a foundational problem in prevention sustainability, herein termed the Functional-Actor Transition Dilemma (F-ATD), which characterizes the often unactuated transition process by which participants shift from reliance on external functional actors as drivers of behavior continuance to internally driven, self-regulated forces of behavior persistence.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/myf75_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/myf75_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00703539370874251}]
