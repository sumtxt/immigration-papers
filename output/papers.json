Taboni", "abstract": "Appellate courts with discretionary dockets have multiple ways to review lower courts. We develop a formal model that evaluates the trade‐offs between “full review”—which features full briefing, oral arguments, and signed opinions—versus “quick review,” where a higher court can summarily reverse a lower court. We show that having the option of costless summary reversal can increase compliance by lower courts but also distorts their behavior compared to relying only on costly full review. When the higher court is uncertain about the lower court's preferences, the threat of summary reversal can lead an aligned lower court to “pander” and issue the opposite disposition to that preferred by the higher court. Access to summary reversal can therefore harm the higher court in some circumstances. Our analysis provides a theoretical foundation for growing concern over the U.S. Supreme Court's “shadow docket”—of which summarily reversals are a component—which has been empirically focused to date.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70018", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70018", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005517870691216453}, {"title": "A drag on the ticket?

There are even fewer studies that seek to explain how party salience strategies respond to polarising issues. This study addresses these gaps, underscoring a conceptual distinction that is often missed in the literature on issue competition — namely, that issues can divide the electorate at large (‘general issue polarisation’), or according to the party they support (‘party issue polarisation’). Survey data about voter preferences in six Western European countries shows that the correlation between these two types of issue polarisation is weak. For example, while some cultural issues like soft drug policy and same-sex marriage are highly polarising in general, they do not divide supporters of opposing parties so much. Using party Twitter activity as the dependent variable, it is shown that parties put less emphasis on issues the more extreme voter preferences are, running contrary to predictions based on prior work. By contrast, issues higher in party polarisation received more attention. This study highlights the importance of taking a multidimensional approach to issue polarisation, and calls for more refined theories of how parties deal with polarising issues.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13540688251405734", "doi": "10.1177/13540688251405734", "journal_full": "Party Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.023543182293356946}, {"title": "Promoting gender equality or co-opting feminism?

One likely reason for this is data limitations, as we have thus far lacked a comprehensive dataset on party logos. To fill this gap, this article introduces the “Political Parties Logos Database” (PPLD), the first comprehensive, cross-national database of party logos. In this article, we first introduce the PPLD and then use the database to empirically examine why parties change their logo. Drawing on seminal work on party change, we argue that parties change their logo after decreases in their electoral performance or changes in their party leader. Using the PPLD, we find little to no evidence that changes to a party’s electoral performance increases the probability of a party changing its logo. In contrast, we find strong evidence that changes to the party’s leader, moderated by the strength of the leader, predict party logo change.

Nonetheless, we uncover consistent evidence of a gender gap in nomination fundraising effort, revealing that women candidates need twice as many donors to achieve the same fundraising results as men.

This article develops a theory of the ideological security dilemma to explain this puzzle. Like the military security dilemma, states may take defensive measures to safeguard the legitimacy of their own ideology, but these actions can be interpreted by others as ideological offensives aimed at weakening the legitimacy of rival ideologies. I test the theory through a process tracing of US–China ideological competition from 1991 to 2024. I find that although the United States initially hoped China would democratize voluntarily, democratizing China was not a central policy goal. Conversely, while China seeks global respect for its “China model,” actively exporting authoritarian ideology is not its goal either. Nevertheless, China perceives US efforts as aimed at regime change, prompting Beijing to promote the “China model” more assertively as a countermeasure to what it sees as a US ideological assault. This intensifies US fears of the global spread of authoritarianism and triggers further counteractions.

Schelling is incisive about the credibility of deterrence, but the credibility of leadership is reduced to the Cold War assumption that power is decisive. While the rise of China and Putin’s invasion of Ukraine have rekindled interest in Schelling’s approach, the diffusion of agency and the interrelationship of issues in the current multinodal era have undermined the efficacy of hegemonic coercion. Rather than restoring Cold War bipolarity, the rise of China has created an asymmetric parity with the United States in which overlapping interdependencies inhibit the formation of camps. In the new era, the pursuit of strategic advantage by any state, large or small, must aim at securing its multidimensional welfare in a complex and unpredictable environment. The global powers are not hegemonic contenders, but rather the largest powers in a multinodal matrix of autonomous states in which each confronts uncertainty. A strategy based on coercion is likely to be less effective against its targets and more costly in its collateral effects.

To address this challenge, we propose a computational approach that builds on public statements ( personality cues ) to infer politicians’ personalities from textual data. To do so, we operationalize two key political traits—agency and communion—using a theory-driven, domain-specific framework. We then compare various computational text analysis methods for extracting these traits from a large corpus of politicians’ parliamentary speeches, social media posts, and interviews. We validate our approach using a comprehensive set of human-labeled data, functional tests, and analyses of how prominently personality traits appear in the statements of German politicians and in the 2024 U.S. presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.

Belief change has a long history of research in the social sciences. Yet, in quantitative research, belief change is studied largely through cognitive and behavioral lenses, that, however valuable, struggle to capture how people themselves experience and narrate transformation and how this is made meaningful and sustained as a social process . Additionally, qualitative studies on belief change remain marginal in the field and are often confined to case‐specific analyses of radical conversions. In response to this gap, this paper develops a qualitative and narrative approach to studying belief change. First, we argue that belief change is biographically situated, culturally mediated and socially embedded. Then, we draw on two contrasting case studies—on turning towards conspiracy theories and gaining anti‐racist awareness through film—to find “master narratives” of belief change. We offer a framework that distinguishes three recurring narrative steps, rooted in cultural repertoires: retrospective constructions of past selves, narrations of transformation, and interpretations of present selves in relation to these transformations. This theoretical and methodological framework aims to contribute to the further understanding of belief change as not only an attitudinal shift but also a reworking of one's life story.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70090", "doi": "10.1111/pops.70090", "journal_full": "Political Psychology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01019487118916329}, {"title": "Advancing the interface between research and practice in sustainable development: A view from Political Psychology", "authors": "James.

In aggregate, the laws have no significant effect on turnout. However, the disaggregated analysis reveals heterogeneity that may explain the conflicting findings in the literature. In presidential elections, late-adopting states—those passing laws after 2008—experience a 2.7 percentage point decrease in turnout, while early-adopting states—those passing laws before 2008—are not significantly affected. For midterm elections, there is no evidence of decreased turnout; counterintuitively, the main analysis suggests an increase of 2.9 percentage points, with larger effects among early-adopting states, though this finding is not robust across all specifications.

Applying Wagner’s methodology for measuring affective polarization in a multi-party system, we calculate affective polarization in three ways: the traditional method as the absolute difference between liberal and conservative politicians, mean distance as the average distance from a person’s favorite politician, and spread as the average distance from an individual’s mean feelings toward politicians. We investigate how social media use is related to affective polarization using these three measures based on a survey of 1,159 respondents from Colombia in 2022. The findings indicate that the three measures of affective polarization intensify with the use of social media, mediated by ideological extremity. The results suggest that the role of social media and ideology may be consistent regardless of the way of measuring affective polarization when a country has multiple parties and political elites, further suggesting implications for affective polarization in political systems with more than two parties.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251399007", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251399007", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008195587643807234}, {"title": "Governing AI virtual anchors in China’s live streaming E-commerce ecosystem: Policy challenges and global implications", "authors": "Yuxi Meng", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103109", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103109", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.029797842777837036}, {"title": "Network infrastructure and corporate development: A dual perspective on corporate social responsibility performance and productivity performance", "authors": "Yuhong Huang, Mudan Lan", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103127", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103127", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006473885180035555}, {"title": "Estimating the impact of Value Added Tax exemptions on smartphone penetration in Colombia using the synthetic control method", "authors": "Sindhura Kammardi Sachidananda, Leon Tinashe Gwaka, Christopher S.

Our analysis suggests that from 1978 to 1997, the gradualist approach contributed to China’s aggregate total factor productivity and economic growth primarily through policies that facilitated the reallocation of surplus labor from agriculture to nonagricultural sectors. Since 1998, the government’s focus shifted, with various reforms encouraging large enterprises, whether state owned or privately owned, to enter capital-intensive sectors, making capital deepening the main driver of economic growth. While this strategy sustained China’s GDP growth, it also increased trade tensions with global partners, created barriers to transitioning to a consumption-led economy, and threatened China’s long-term financial stability, casting long shadows over the Chinese economy.

We examine various forces that drive natural interest rates negative: temporarily (such as banking crises and debt overhangs) or permanently (such as demographic shifts and inequality). When policy rates hit the zero lower bound, conventional monetary tools lose traction. Under a standard monetary policy regime, counterintuitive paradoxes emerge: Greater price flexibility deepens recessions, and positive supply shocks become contractionary. We show how policy effects—including the size of fiscal multipliers, forward guidance, and these paradoxes—depend critically on the monetary-fiscal regime and on central bank credibility. The paper explains how regime changes, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt’s 1933 abandonment of the gold standard and balanced-budget dogmas, successfully reversed deep slumps by credibly shifting expectations.

Exploiting Argentina’s unique sub-precinct election reporting system, we show that the campaign reduced Milei’s support among directly treated voters, as expected, but increased his support among untreated voters in treated precincts, producing a backfiring, net-positive effect for Milei. A pre-registered replication confirmed these opposite-signed effects. Using theory and a survey experiment, we show that the minority of voters who disbelieved the campaign were more motivated to discuss it with peers, convincing them to support Milei.

The government funding support saves more firms but cannot be customized based on firm productivity, dampening the cleansing effect of crises.

This article analyses the significance of this qualification criterion which is expressed in German migration law by the requirement for third-country nationals to hold a formal qualification recognised in Germany, in order to obtain residence and work permits. Therefore, it highlights a selectivity mechanism in migration policy within broader debates on how to analyse the functioning of selective systems – moving beyond a purely economic framing of demand- and supply-driven models. It does so by first analysing the development of German migration policy based on bilateral agreements towards a qualification-based policy, which has opened up to non-academically trained workers, particularly in recent years, and by secondly examining migration channels that do not require formally recognised qualification. The analysis shows that while formal qualifications remain a central criterion in German labour migration policy, a significant share of labour migration from third countries – understood as migration for the legal purpose of employment – occurs through pathways that waive this criterion. The one-sided focus on skilled labour immigration therefore does not reflect the complex reality of migration to Germany.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00510-7", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00510-7", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9884327914764206}, {"title": "Klandamentalism: Bob Jones at the intersection of revivalism, politics, and white supremacy", "authors": "Krzysztof Kasiński", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2596924", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2596924", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0531025200239682}, {"title": "No race, no country: the politics and poetics of Richard Wright", "authors": "Mehdi Ghasemi", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2594526", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2594526", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.07528304721155932}, {"title": "Race and the forms of knowledge: technique, identity, and place in artistic research", "authors": "Norbert Finzsch", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2520419", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2520419", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.039130259700717374}, {"title": "Adapting and validating the Everyday Colourism Scale with Black and South Asian adolescents living in the UK", "authors": "Nadia Craddock, Aisha Phoenix, Paul White", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2591825", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2591825", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06332395153692849}, {"title": "Why are you trying to teach us about institutional racism?

I then examine how closely House members’ voting aligns with these opinions, focusing on districts where White and minority preferences differ. My analysis rules out “coincidental representation’ driven by similar opinions across groups and accounts for how much of each racial group’s national population resides in each district.

Mostly men in their 40s−50s, they initially arrived in Korea as migrant workers and were later recognised as refugees for their political activities against the military government. When returning to Myanmar from the 2010s after the NLD (National League for Democracy) resumed power, it was difficult to find a jari in politics, not having ‘earned their right’ by suffering with activists who remained in Myanmar. Since they engaged in diasporic political activities instead of working, they did not return with money expected by families of migrant workers. Instead, they made alternative jari in education, community organisation or social enterprises through their transnational social networks and their social, political and economic remittances from Korea. This paper is based on qualitative research in Korea and Myanmar in 2018 using life‐story interviews, participant observations and researcher reflexivity. This paper used jari , a political, relational, emotional and dynamic conceptualisation of place to present the refugees' ideas of place when they returned. An alternative to state‐centric views of refugee repatriation, their relationship to a jari was the basis of the process in building livelihoods and belonging on return.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70166", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70166", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.8935454892905091}, {"title": "Returning From Study Abroad in a Nontraditional Destination: Spatial Stigmatisation and the Crises of Capital Conversion", "authors": "Sarah Jane D.

Wedding perspectives from Bourdieu's theory of capital and Said's imaginative geography, this paper adapts the concept of spatial stigmatisation to frame how capital conversion as a means to social reproduction is a complex process that is mediated by the discursive (de)valuation of destinations of study as spaces accorded with differential symbolic values. Conceptually, it argues for a geographic view of capital to foreground broader spatial hierarchies that shape the recognition and transferability of capital across borders. Empirically, it sheds light on the after‐study lives of Korean student returnees from a nontraditional destination whose realities are often hidden under dominant discourses that link study abroad outcomes with capital acquired from the Anglophone West and positive return experiences. By paying attention to Korean student returnees from the Philippines—an underrepresented topic within both international student mobilities and Korean study abroad literature—the paper similarly broadens the scope for deploying comparative research on return experiences across different spatialities, deepening at the same time understanding of the complex interactions between place, space and capital within the context of study abroad.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70164", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70164", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.05032170266316949}, {"title": "Video-call glitches trigger uncanniness and harm consequential life outcomes", "authors": "Melanie S.

We explore the impact of backsliding leaders’ anti-institutional rhetoric in the context of Mexico. With text-as-data analyses, we demonstrate the harshness of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s (2018–2024) anti-institutional diatribes against the agency that oversees national elections. With survey experiments, we demonstrate that these diatribes can indeed undermine public confidence. Yet our research also uncovers the potential for rebuttals to restore confidence. Counternarratives offered by organizations viewed as above the fray of Mexican politics restored public confidence—surprisingly, even among the president’s supporters.

By design, civil‐law judiciaries are typically governed by bureaucratic, merit‐based promotion procedures. Yet even in such systems, women remain underrepresented in senior judicial positions. We develop a model to distinguish between two mechanisms— promotion aversion and sex discrimination—and derive empirically testable implications. Drawing on a unique longitudinal dataset covering the full careers of nearly 7000 Spanish judges from 2005 to 2023, we combine survival models, matched mixed‐effects regressions, and data on voluntary specialization exams to analyze career advancement. Our results show that promotion aversion and sex discrimination operate at different stages of judicial careers: women who apply for promotion are highly qualified and successful in early‐career moves, but face structural barriers in later discretionary appointments.

Yet, a critical and underexplored dimension remains: the role of SLBs in context of war and armed conflict, where threats to personal safety, political coercion, and institutional collapse converge. This article investigates how war—and military occupation in particular—reshapes the everyday work, moral dilemmas, and response strategies of SLBs operating under extreme conditions. We focus on the war in Ukraine—the most intense armed conflict on European soil since World War II. Within this context, we examine education professionals, as schools and universities have become strategic targets of Russian occupation forces: cultural frontlines central to the legitimization of territorial control and forced assimilation. Complex dilemmas emerge: should SLBs continue providing services to the population—thus risking complicity with the occupiers and being branded as “traitors”—or should they refrain from any contact with them, at the risk of facing violent punishment? Our analysis draws on qualitative data collected through fieldwork in six Ukrainian regions; semi-structured and in-depth interviews (both online and face-to-face) with education professionals who experienced the Russian occupation; and qualitative document analysis of media coverage and human rights reports. Following an abductive research design, we identify four structural features that distinguish war from other crises: forced interaction with enemy state actors, institutional weaponization, loyalty dilemmas, and bureaucratic rupture under contested sovereignties. Building on these findings, we propose a fourfold typology of SLB response strategies—exit, accommodation, local defiance, and remote adaptation—each grounded in distinct moral decisions.

Women who break marital name norms by keeping their surnames are perceived as less committed to their relationships, but—unlike men—they are not ‘rewarded’ with higher perceived professional commitment.

I find, first, that contested criminal control, where multiple groups compete for dominance, is associated with significantly higher homicide rates. Second, migrants crossing through these contested territories face higher cumulative exposure to hazards, even after accounting for demographic vulnerabilities and border enforcement. Third, risk is unevenly distributed across the border: migrants crossing through eastern sectors, marked by fragmented and volatile criminal governance, experience higher dangers than those crossing western corridors where criminal authority, while not monolithic, tends to be more consolidated or negotiated.

Drawing on procedural justice theory, psychological coping frameworks, and criminological research on distance decay, the analysis matches geocoded Afrobarometer survey data with Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project riot events across twenty-three African countries. Findings confirm that riot exposure generally reduces trust in the police, but the effect is non-linear: trust is not eroded in riot epicenters and declines more steeply at moderate distances, all relative to greater distance. Lethal riots, compared to non-lethal ones, exacerbate this erosion and heighten fear of violence.

We propose a two-layer Panopticon framework for digital surveillance. Dictators can directly surveil citizens. They can also surveil the frontline agents responsible for implementing repression, reducing shirking and improving prevention. We test this framework in China using an original dataset of 51,611 government procurement contracts that captures digital workplace surveillance of agents alongside mass surveillance of citizens. We find that each layer independently reduces protest and that their interaction produces modestly reinforcing effects. Causal mediation analysis reveals an asymmetric mechanism: about one-third of the protest-reducing effect of citizen surveillance operates through increased oversight of agents, while agent-facing surveillance reduces protest directly.

However, the impact of relative local deprivation—how individuals perceive their neighborhood’s socio-economic conditions in comparison to nearby, more affluent areas—has remained underexplored. This article addresses that gap by examining the role of relative local deprivation in shaping political involvement. By conceptualizing relative deprivation in two distinct ways—comparison with neighboring districts and comparison with higher-level areas—I offer a unique perspective on how local inequalities influence political involvement. Using data from a large-scale study in England and Wales (n = 25,001) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation at the postcode district level (ndistricts = 2,290), the results show that residents in areas with higher relative local deprivation are significantly less likely to vote or engage in other forms of political participation. Specifically, respondents from such districts are 1.4–2.1 percentage points less likely to vote, even when controlling for socio-structural factors and (perceived) actual deprivation. These findings highlight the independent effect of relative local deprivation on political involvement, suggesting that individuals in disadvantaged areas become disillusioned when they perceive their district as falling behind neighboring communities.

As a result, local communities increasingly mobilize against data center construction. We use a vignette and conjoint survey experiment in Germany to evaluate how publics think about the environmental, economic, and (geo)political tradeoffs that data centers entail. We find that directly priming people with digital sovereignty concerns only marginally increases support for building more data centers. Yet, support for data centers varies substantially based on characteristics that people do have strong views about: decarbonization, geopolitics, and local environmental and economic impact. Geopolitical concerns are particularly salient: people strongly favor data centers operated by German or European firms over US or Chinese operators. These effects are large even when compared to the effects of substantial electricity price increases and variation in energy sources.

Second, some conceptualize alignment as \\textit{agreement}, for example similarity in UN voting, while others treat it as a \\textit{relationship}, such as alliances or arms transfers.

However, that framework operated primarily within the constraints of a closed-system analysis, focusing on the endogenous drivers of collapse and regime change. This paper expands that theoretical horizon to address a fundamental question of historical directionality: why do some systems, when reaching critical levels of internal stress (Instability Coefficient K ≥ 2.4), implode into civil war and fragmentation, while others explode outward in waves of conquest, colonization, and hegemony? To answer this, we introduce the Cross-System Equilibration Loop (CSEL), a feedback dynamic that governs the interaction between a system and its external environment. We posit that expansion is not merely a political choice driven by individual ambition, but a thermodynamic necessity triggered by a specific Structural Gradient (G)—the differential between the internal pressure of a hyper-coherent core and the structural vacuum of its periphery. When this gradient exceeds a critical threshold, the system activates a specific expansionist mode of the Ascent Channel, seeking to restore equilibrium not by reducing its own complexity, but by replicating its internal order across a wider territory. This process functions as a mechanism of seed dispersal, wherein the accumulated cultural and archetypal energy of the core is projected outward to structure the surrounding chaos. Whether through the symbiotic projection of Hellenic culture by the Macedonian military vector, or the unitary projection of revolutionary ideals by Napoleonic France, the underlying mechanic remains consistent: the export of high-entropy internal energy to fuel the imposition of low-entropy structural order upon a lower-energy periphery. Integrating the diagnostic tools of the Anatomy of Chaos with this new gradient-based logic, this paper offers a unified, falsifiable theory of expansion, explaining how the internal temperature of a society dictates its geopolitical trajectory.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/snjt5_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/snjt5_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.015656478405844387}, {"title": "Does Partisanship or Arguing Activate Political Motivated Reasoning?", "authors": "Andrew T.

In our first study, we randomize the partisanship of real endorsements for ballot propositions, as well as whether participants learn about these endorsements before observing other information about the propositions. We find no evidence of motivated information processing across several tests. In a second study, we randomize whether participants themselves argue for or against a proposition, and whether they know this position before observing other information. This produces a strong order effect: being randomized to argue for versus against a position affects beliefs more when it is learned before information about the proposition is provided.

I then compare school-level effects with those from parental background to address the proxy-versus-cause debate. Analysing data from three waves of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study, I find evidence that structurally low and declining performance depresses political trust among adolescents.

This research activity was carried out as part of the Logistics Research and Development 4.0 Project launched by La Logistica Srl, a new player in the distribution of hydro-thermo sanitary products, with the support of the Puglia Region. The purpose of this study is to provide managers with a range of customized process information to improve workforce efficiency and management in receiving, controlling, and storing goods entering the newly established logistics hub. Other researchers’ work had shortcomings, as did the lack of this study’s practical approach. This study aims to overcome these constraints. To do so, the study introduces the Content Load Parameter (CLP) index. This index integrates three variables relevant to defining the workload, such as quantity, size and weights of the goods to be handled, using a single standard value. This makes it easier for managers to estimate the required capacity all along the work cycle. As part of the system development, a module analyzes and simulates operational scenarios. Simulation facilitates the management of analysis capacity by allowing alternatives to be compared and evaluated to bridge the gap between demand and availability of production capacity in various situations. Scenario simulation, combined with tools for concise and effective visualization of results, therefore allows organizations to identify critical capacity points and take preventative measures to manage overhead and minimize consequences. In summary, this study demonstrates how integrating the Content Load Parameter index into a decision support system can significantly contribute to making intralogistics process management more effective. By addressing quantifiable workload parameters and facilitating scenario-based operational analysis, the proposed system provides managers with useful information for capacity optimization.

We expect that limited French proficiency restricts equitable access to care. Using the Trajectoires et Origines 2 survey conducted in 2019 in France among over 27,000 individuals---oversampling immigrant-origin populations---we investigate how language shapes healthcare use. France provides a relevant case, as immigrants come from diverse origins, including former colonies where French is an official language, generating substantial variation in proficiency. Findings show significant language-related disparities in medical visits, except for generalist practitioners. To address possible endogeneity bias in the relationship between language and healthcare uptake, we construct an instrument combining age at arrival in France and linguistic distance between French and the mother tongue. This method reveals a significant language effect only for visits to psychologists or psychiatrists.

Spatial marking leads to formal and informal rules dictating the differential treatment of communities largely based on racial composition, and should therefore be conceptualized as a structural determinant of health. In the case of the Swedish police list, we argue Spatial Marking amounts to the criminalization of entire neighborhoods, whose residents are subject to stigma and increased police interventions which should negatively impact the health of the people that live there. We assess this possibility with geo-located register data using a staggered difference in differences design to estimate the effect of being added to the police list across 9 health outcomes.

In this study, we model COSAP systems as a competitive diffusion process where two stubborn agents seek to influence a population through iterated network positioning. Simulations across networks of varying structure reveal that while agents generally race to occupy the most central node, networks with short path lengths create conditions in which neither agent can maintain an uncontested advantage. Instead, agents engage in adaptive cycles, repeatedly shifting positions in response to one other. These limit cycles vary in length and complexity depending on global network properties, with highly connected networks supporting persistent cycling and longer cycles, whereas networks with longer path lengths cause cycles to collapse into fixed points.

To investigate the link between emigration and teenage pregnancy, this study performed a secondary analysis of the 2015 Colombia Demographic and Health Survey, a large and in-depth survey using the 2005 Colombian census as its sampling frame.

The study found no such relationship. Instead, school attendance and wealth were both significantly associated with teenage pregnancy. The lack of a significant finding may stem from the fact that Colombian migration generally does not tend to flow to nations with higher quality healthcare and health information, or from the fact that those most at risk of teenage pregnancy were also the least likely to be exposed to migrants living in countries with access to better healthcare.

Nigeria is one of the nations within sub-Saharan Africa that report the highest number of cases of internally displaced persons (IDPs), mostly caused by cyclical conflict and catastrophic floods. Although information related to the presence of IDPs in formal camps or staying with host families is abundant, there is a conspicuous gap in the literature concerning those individuals, living in non-camp settings, who have already established themselves within communities and are often not visible to formal support networks. This paper set out to illuminate the peculiar issues and plight of such non-camped IDPs in the Ibadan metropolis, Nigeria. The study took a qualitative approach, rooted in interpretivism, and employed a case study design. Given that this particular subset of the population was difficult to identify, the researcher used snowball sampling, ending up with a sample of 14 respondents, including internally displaced persons (IDPs), key informants, and mendicants. They gathered data by using key informant interviews (KIIs) and semi-structured interviews and analysed the data using thematic analysis. The results shed light on three major thematic areas: challenges faced, effects of non-camp environment on various aspects of the lives of IDPS and survival strategies. Data from the interviews revealed that the bulk of the problems that non-camp IDPs face are lack of basic amenities, extreme health problems, extreme financial instability, daily insecurity, and social isolation. The vulnerability this group faces in the form of theft, violence and harassment is compounded by the lack of formal protection. Besides, living conditions are unstable and have a significant impact on livelihood, education interruption, and housing instability. To endure, the IDPs employ various survival tactics, such as supplementing random jobs with mendicancy, resorting to self-medication and informal social groups to stay healthy, and maintaining safety by staying in groups. The paper concludes that non-camp IDPs are caught in a web of vulnerability that is compounded by the absence of formalised support systems, which make their situation distinctively unique to that of formal camp settings. The results suggest that the most effective approach to helping this peculiar population is a combination of various interventions, such as increased access to healthcare, livelihood support, improved community security, and better housing to help them recover and experience social integration in the long term.

But what happens when autocratic states become so influential that they dominate decision-making in IOs and which types of organizations are most prone to autocratic takeover? The study presents a novel theory on autocratic influence in IOs, which argues that an interplay of IOs’ (i) thematic focus, (ii) membership composition, and (iii) decision rules explains the scale of autocratic influence. The theory further highlights how member selection processes within the UN’s regional groups can facilitate disproportionate autocratic representation. The study leverages evidence from two original datasets on the decisions of the UN Committee on NGOs between 1998 and 2024 to test whether the theorized conditions linked to autocratic influence can translate into autocratic dominance in practice. Multi-pronged evidence demonstrates that autocracies have effectively seized the UN Committee on NGOs and exploit it to systematically defer and reject the applications of liberal NGOs. A comparative analysis with the ECOSOC highlights that a disproportionate autocratic representation in the Committee’s membership is the key mechanism that explains autocratic dominance.

The process moves through (1) Concealment, where masking creates invisible burnout, (2) Transition Triggers emerging from unsustainable tension, with disclosure triggered by one of two paths: an “exhaustion route” (resource depletion) or an “empowerment route” (a safe invitation), (3) the Disclosure moment itself with divergent trajectories, and (4) Post-Disclosure Outcomes.

As part of developing a follow-up program, Nantes University Hospital selected Vivifrail, a structured, multicomponent exercise program designed to improve strength, balance, and mobility. This study aimed to evaluate the barriers and drivers conducive to the adoption of Vivifrail among frail older patients who had recently undergone cardiac surgery. Methods: We performed a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews between March and December 2024. Eligible patients had recently undergone cardiac surgery in Nantes University Hospital, were aged 75 years and older, with a baseline SPPB score &lt;9. Patients were interviewed between weeks 5 and 6 post-discharge. Interview transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Results: Among 27 eligible patients, 23 were interviewed. The first 9 interviews were conducted using a preliminary version of the guide in order to help us enrich the final version. As a result, we retained and analyzed data from 14 interviews, at which point data saturation was reached. The average age was 79 years old (±4), and 71% were men. Three main themes emerged from the interviews. First, patients frequently described post-operative challenges such as impaired physical condition, discomfort, and fatigue. Second, despite these difficulties, the vast majority demonstrated moderate to strong adherence. Upon returning home, the Vivifrail program served as a framework for patients to start physical activity. The support of healthcare professionals and family also appeared to be decisive. Third, patients reported adapting their PA according to the recovery of their abilities, particularly through performing activities of daily living, drawing on personal and environmental resources. Conclusions: The Vivifrail program appears to be a feasible and effective approach for guiding frail older adults who have recently undergone cardiac surgery towards establishing a regular physical activity routine. Given the exploratory and qualitative nature of our study, our findings are not representative of the entire frail older population but may be transferable to other similar patients in comparable care settings.

Nowak, John Drake, John Drury", "abstract": "Background: We describe the protocol for the Epi-Q (EpiGame-Quarantine) Study, using an experimental epidemic game (“epigame”) to investigate quarantine-related attitudes and behaviors. Epigames are field experiments in which participants make behavioral decisions during a simulated epidemic in naturalistic settings. In this study, the epigame is operationalized via a smartphone app that simulates transmission of a 'digital pathogen' over Bluetooth, allowing for real-time data capture. This approach offers a novel tool for observing decision-making within social networks under dynamic risk and normative pressure. Consequently, it enables the collection of empirical data on the social, psychological, and practical determinants of compliance with non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as quarantine. Unlike existing methods that rely on static cross-sectional surveys or observational data, Epi-Q captures dynamic decision-making within real-life networks. This is crucial for studying behaviors like quarantine, where compliance is not merely an individual calculation but is shaped by pre-existing and evolving social structures, including peer pressure, trust in institutions, and exposure to misinformation. Epi-Q employs a quantitative mixed-method design to untangle the complex interplay between social norms and risk perception, along with their interactions on behavioral responses. Methods/design: We will recruit at least 150 participants via a custom-made smartphone app capable of measuring proximity between then using Bluetooth. We will randomly allocate these participants (via network-aware clustering) into a 2×2 experimental design: (i) local vs global risk information; (ii) local vs global norms. ‘Local’ information is defined as data derived from a participant's first-degree contacts in the Bluetooth proximity network, while 'Global' information refers to aggregate data from the entire experimental group. Participants will play the epigame over a period of several weeks (one to three), making daily quarantine decisions within the app that incur costs (loss of in-game points for infection, loss of opportunities while quarantining) and benefits (points from remaining active), while Bluetooth proximity sensing samples the contact network of participants and drives simulated transmission of a digital pathogen among the phones. Data collection will include in-app behavioral logs, pre- and post-game surveys (attitudes, risk perception), and optional qualitative debrief interviews with a subset of participants. Primary outcomes will be frequency and timing of quarantine adoption; secondary outcomes will include attitudinal shifts, perceived risk, and the consistency of real-world vs in-game intentions.

These platforms establish channels through which users can report illegal activity, removing infringing content. Few studies have explored the factors that lead users to interact with platforms through their reporting systems. This study offers quantitative evidence on these motives, seeking to explore whether some of the causes linked to police reporting of cybercrime or conventional crimes also apply to reporting to the platform. Specifically, it applies to reporting to multiplayer video game companies through a survey of players.

Persistent challenges related to data quality, consistency, and comparability, highlighted by the European Commission, continue to limit effective policymaking. Despite increasing attention to equity in transport research and practice, most countries still lack standardized national datasets that can capture the scale and severity of transport poverty. This paper presents the design and implementation of the first large-scale survey on transport poverty and transport-related social exclusion worldwide, developed by the Mobilizing Justice Partnership across all of Canada. We describe a multi-phase process involving collaborative workshops, input from a community advisory group, a pilot study, and a robust data collection strategy, including a comprehensive sampling and weighting process. The resulting dataset, covering over 27,000 respondents and openly available to researchers, decision-makers, and the public, offers extensive spatial and demographic coverage, enabling robust and policy-relevant analysis. A snapshot of findings reveals pronounced socioeconomic and demographic inequalities in Canada. Car ownership remains substantially lower among lower-income Canadians (under 70%) compared to higher-income groups (94%), while transit pass possession is more common among lower-income respondents. Approximately one in four participants experience modal dissonance, though its prevalence does not differ by income; instead, reasons behind this mismatch vary, with lower-income groups citing affordability constraints, whereas higher-income groups attribute mismatches to convenience and time considerations. Significant disparities in perceived safety were observed across gender, with non-binary individuals reporting the lowest levels of perceived safety, followed by women, and men reporting the highest. Satisfaction with transport conditions increases with age, with younger groups reporting consistently lower satisfaction. Racial disparities were evident in reported employment impacts, as Indigenous respondents and visible minorities were more likely to report declining job opportunities due to transport barriers. Housing affordability concerns were most acute among recent immigrants, who more frequently reported spending beyond their means on housing. Spatial analyses further demonstrate strong geographic variability in transport disadvantage, particularly in patterns of forced car ownership, suggesting the need for further exploration into the sociodemographic characteristics of this phenomenon, moving beyond solely built environment factors.

No significant differences emerged in perceived performance. Moreover, resistance to change negatively affected perceived performance in family firms, while organizational culture showed an independent role. Findings underscore culture’s nuanced influence on adaptability and performance.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vbuam_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vbuam_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011801527358050623}, {"title": "Teaching Accessibility through Automated Audits: Using ANDI in Higher Education", "authors": "Tolu Adedoja", "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Justice’s April 2026 deadline for Title II web accessibility compliance places new urgency on higher education institutions to adopt sustainable accessibility practices. Yet, many universities continue to focus remediation narrowly on disability services pages, leaving their broader digital presence inaccessible to students, faculty, and the public. This paper presents a teaching strategy that leverages the Accessible Name and Description Inspector (ANDI), a free audit tool developed by the U.S. Social Security Administration, as both an instructional and governance mechanism. By training IT staff and content authors to use ANDI, institutions can identify recurring accessibility barriers, connect them to WCAG 2.1 AA and Title II obligations, and establish governance routines that foster sustainable compliance. The method is illustrated through a multi-institution audit of higher education websites, including a case study showing how false positives can serve as teaching moments. This contribution is explicitly positioned as a teaching note, offering a practical and scalable model for embedding accessibility education into institutional governance and compliance.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vmxwn_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vmxwn_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01311559842929888}, {"title": "Linking longitudinal population studies to administrative data on children’s social care: A scoping review", "authors": "Grace Bailey, Karen Broadhurst, Jonathan Scourfield, Katie Harron, Rowena Bailey, Alissa Goodman, Alyce Raybould, Orla McBride, Richard J. Silverwood, Andy Boyd", "abstract": "This scoping review explores the use of longitudinal population data linked to administrative data to further our understanding of the characteristics and outcomes of children involved in children’s social care (CSC) services within the UK. We searched eight electronic databases (Web of Science, SSCI, APA PsychInfo, Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL Ultimate, ASSIA) to identify relevant publications between 1 January 2000 and 22 July 2025. Despite the UK’s longstanding investment into longitudinal population studies, published studies have been limited to four populations that have been linked to CSC records. Around a third of the published studies (6/16) relied on a single local authority-based population (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children). The publications demonstrated links between parental and early childhood characteristics and subsequent involvement in CSC. Few publications examined longer-term outcomes, the wider family and the effectiveness of interventions. Data linkage has the potential to improve our understanding across services, including health, education, justice and welfare systems, for children involved with social care services. Upcoming work using electronic data such as the Born in Bradford’s Better Start study show promise in producing more integrated insights. Importantly, while this review focuses on the UK, the lessons learned and the value of linking LPS and administrative data are highly relevant in international contexts where similar data assets exist. The review highlights the opportunities of data linkage to improve our understanding of the circumstances and experiences of young people and their families who are involved in the social care system.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wczmj_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wczmj_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009989587957180746}]
