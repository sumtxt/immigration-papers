Recent methodological advances have allowed researchers to impute racial and ethnic classifications based on publicly available information, but predictions vary in their accuracy and can introduce statistical biases in downstream analyses. We provide an overview of common estimation methods, including Bayesian approaches and machine learning techniques that use names or images as inputs. We propose and test a hybrid approach that combines surname-based Bayesian estimation with the use of publicly available images in a convolutional neural network. We find that the proposed approach not only reduces statistical bias in downstream analyses but also improves accuracy in a sample of over 16,000 local elected officials.

To accomplish this, the protectorate of discrimination law should be expanded where relevant to include that characteristic. Moreover, in contexts where political and specifically affective polarisation is severe, the risk of such treatment increases, further justifying the legal innovation.

We argue that firms with more linkages throughout the domestic economy enjoy a privileged political position. Benefits to these firms extend indirectly to a wider set of constituents, which allows firms to assemble broader coalitions and to portray protectionist policy as more than purely particularistic politics. We provide evidence for this argument by developing original measures of linkages between firms, derived from over 600,000 customer–supplier relationships among industries, matching them with data on anti-dumping petitions filed by US firms, written briefs filed by members of Congress on behalf of these firms, and the geographic distribution of industries. Our account identifies a new explanation of differences in the political influence of firms, underscores the relevance of domestic production networks in politics, and offers a novel perspective on cleavages and coalitions in trade politics.

It is thus notable that a group of East Asian countries, from Japan and Korea to Thailand, undertake frequent and often large interventions to devalue their currencies.

This approach faces new challenges as China's nuclear capabilities increase. Through nuclear learning, China needs to update its core beliefs regarding arms control, shifting from seeing it as a means to restrain China to emphasizing the shared interest among nuclear powers and the value of reassurance in preventing nuclear war and arms races.

The conventional wisdom in English-language discourses focuses on the group's organizational capabilities, particularly its military capacity, ideology, propaganda, and governance/state-building apparatus. Iraqi discourses suggest that in addition to these capabilities, the state opponents of ISIS enabled the group's growth because they benefited from its violence. The differences between these two broad narratives about ISIS matter because they reveal what is generally unsayable in mainstream discourses about the drivers of terrorism, which is that terrorist groups can reproduce through and alongside state power rather than in simple opposition to it. We conducted more than sixty in-depth, semi-structured interviews across Iraq with Iraqi and Western security analysts, journalists, humanitarian workers, and diplomats. Our interlocutors suggested that state actors had facilitated ISIS, at least at times. We argue that this facilitation is an example of what Michael Taussig refers to as a “public secret”—something that experts widely discuss but seldom document. The Iraq-based view that we detail suggests that states maintain power by enabling, and profiting from, unpredictable and plausibly deniable violence in the periphery—something that ISIS supplied in abundance.

We identify two factors, geography and technology, that affect the likelihood of the paradox leading to conflict. We find that limited conventional war—which may escalate to a limited nuclear war—is more likely in maritime East Asia than a land war was in Cold War Europe. Whether strategic nuclear stability increases or decreases the likelihood of limited conflict likely depends on how each side in a conflict dyad regards the prospects for limiting a conflict. To some, the greater prospect of limited war implies that the United States should attempt to maintain full escalation dominance, including by deploying additional theater nuclear systems in East Asia and bolstering its security guarantees to Taiwan. Others may argue that the United States should consider abandoning Taiwan and retrench by balancing China's regional ambitions with strongpoints and allies farther from the Chinese mainland.

China's main concerns are almost all regional and related to parts of China that the rest of the region has agreed are Chinese—Hong Kong, Taiwan, Tibet, and Xinjiang. Our argument has three main implications. First, China does not pose the type of military threat that the conventional wisdom claims it does.

Drawing on original archival research, we showcase the value-added of this conceptual lens by examining the reformulation of the British imperial hierarchy at the 1907 Imperial Conference, which formally institutionalized “Dominion” status for the first time. We show how the British settler-colonies sought to dissociate themselves from the backward and racialized “Crown Colonies,” ultimately adopting the label “Dominion” to assert their status as a qualitatively distinct type of polity. We further argue that dissociation often relies on—and reinforces—racialized logics, which actors draw upon to naturalize social boundaries. Our argument suggests that actors are not merely concerned with being “above” other actors in their comparison group on a status ladder.

To evaluate my theory, I employ a disaggregated analysis that combines new sanctions data with geolocated data on capital distance and subnational state capacity.

We argue that these effects vary across different dimensions of democracy. Drawing on public opinion surveys fielded in Ukraine in October 2022 and July 2024, amidst the ongoing war with Russia, we examine how experiences of wartime violence affect people’s commitment to protecting three core liberal democracy principles: minority rights, freedom of speech, and free and fair elections. Our most consistent finding is that individuals who have been physically injured or lost a close family member or friend are less likely to be supportive of safeguarding the protection of minority rights.

Widespread citizen support poses a challenge to democracy as it can result in the election and empowerment of political leaders favoring militarization, enabling further human rights abuses. We propose and test an information-based theory of change in policy support. We evaluate the effects of increasing the salience of information on state armed actors’ frequent collusion with criminal organizations vis-à-vis the human consequences of militarized operations, in addition to the systematic nature of state armed actors’ unlawful behavior as reported by human rights organizations. We test our hypotheses in Mexico using an original two-wave online panel survey with a conjoint experiment embedded in the second wave. The findings show that making collusion salient reduces support for militarization, independent of the state armed actor in charge. Exposure to information about lethal violence against innocents also results in overall lower policy support, but not information on the systematic nature of abuses. Further analyses suggest that this null finding results from high tolerance for unlawful state armed actors’ behavior, as long as it is perceived to serve the purpose of fighting criminals.

While extant literature on domestic terrorism has paid great attention to its consequences in areas such as economic development, elections, and authoritarian survival, few studies have studied how domestic terrorism influences cooperation between countries. At the same time, the increasing power competition between major powers has renewed scholars’ interest in state overseas defense spending as a strategic tool for power projection. In this article, I propose a theory that connects domestic terrorist attacks with the inflow of US overseas defense spending. With more domestic terrorist attacks, the incumbents are under more pressure from other political elites and the public. Support from major powers such as the US can help leaders’ political survival. For the US, while this presents an opportunity to preserve or even expand its influence on foreign countries and protect its overseas interests, there are risks and uncertainties associated with supporting countries with deteriorating security environments. Compared to other types of support, such as state visits and military aid, overseas defense spending is a more flexible tool the US can adopt to gain policy concession while mitigating risks and uncertainties. However, this effect of domestic terrorist attacks might be conditioned by the regime type of recipient countries.

Competitive electoral constituencies attract attention and investment from parties, political elites, and civil society, restricting the ability of armed actors to successfully coerce voters and politicians. I evaluate this argument against evidence from a paradigmatic case of violent intervention in elections: the attempted capture of the 2002 Colombian Senate elections by the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia (AUC). I find that the AUC’s efforts to channel votes toward allied politicians succeeded in party strongholds but overwhelmingly failed in competitive constituencies.

We argue that the effect of violence is asymmetric and predominantly benefits nationalist, radical-right parties. Posing as defenders of the nation, nationalist parties benefit from violence by their political opponents and violence targeted against perceived threats to the nation. Two potential mechanisms underlie this asymmetric effect. First, nationalist violence becomes an acceptable means of defense in the eyes of status quo-oriented voters if they attribute blame to out-groups who used violence first. Second, nationalist violence itself increases the salience of a threat to the nation, and voters concerned with preserving the status quo see radical right parties as its most effective defender. To test this argument, we collect novel actor-based and geospatial data of political violence in interwar Italy. Using a difference-in-differences estimator, we model the effect of violence on vote shares of anti-system parties at the municipality level in the 1919 and 1921 elections. Our results indicate increasing electoral support for the nationalist Fascist party in municipalities that experienced violence committed by either the far right or left after the 1919 election. In contrast, the radical left Socialist party loses electoral support if violence occurs. These results are robust to different specifications, modeling choices, and measurement approaches.

We argue that the decentralized yet systematic nature of this targeted, lethal violence requires a theoretical framework and empirical approach addressing subnational dynamics. Specifically, we suggest that a significant share of these assassinations stems from the presence of highly territorialized illicit activities, particularly those based on dispossession. These criminal economies are sustained by networks of local elites and criminal actors – criminal-political networks – that develop forms of extra-legal governance and redefine land ownership and resource use, provoking resistance from local communities. When confronted by activist-led challenges, these criminal-political networks respond with lethal violence. We assess this theory through an empirical study of the Brazilian Amazon. Our statistical analysis indicates that the frequency of assassinations is significantly associated with industrial deforestation, a highly territorialized illicit practice involving dispossession. A qualitative case study of the municipality of Altamira further confirms that lethal violence against social activists can be attributed to criminal-political networks responding to local resistance against industrial deforestation, rather than to less territorialized drug trafficking. By bridging debates on criminal governance and socio-environmental conflict, the article contributes theoretically to the growing research on repressive violence against civil society actors in democratic regimes.

Leveraging this intervention, our research addresses a key knowledge gap by examining the impact of deplatforming on the cohesion of extremist group followers. Specifically, we investigate whether deplatforming leads to fragmentation or reinforces unity among the group’s followers.

By analyzing over 12 million tweets from approximately nine thousand Proud Boys supporters between August 1, 2017, and September 1, 2019, we find that deplatforming had a limited effect on reducing group cohesion. Instead, it may have prompted followers to seek broader networks and external interactions, leaving overall cohesion largely intact.

We use this typology to analyze various gradations through which these emotional dynamics develop in fieldwork. Focusing on the navigation between distance and proximity that these dynamics entail, we propose the concept of “emotional proximity” to capture relations between the researcher and the participant.

The political distance separating researchers and participants in these studies allows us to investigate the methodologies of disconnecting political from emotional dynamics across this fourfold schema of ethnographic varieties.

We compile a novel data set on 1,016 constitutional change episodes by 290 tribes. We leverage this information to explore the determinants of variation in tribal constitutional change over time and across tribes. First, we show that the location of tribes influences their propensity to amend, with tribes from the Great Plains and Eastern regions doing so at much higher rates than the rest. We then investigate the influence of changes in federal attitudes towards tribal sovereignty. Our analysis unveils a relationship between a tribe’s demographic and political characteristics on the one hand and its propensity to amend and constitutional longevity on the other. We show that membership size (in 1926) and whether a tribe adopts directly democratic forms of governance positively affects how much and how often it amends its constitution. We also find a surprising positive association between constitutional rigidity and the number and rate at which tribes amend. Our results confirm the influence of federal Indian policy on the trajectory of American Indian sovereignty. Changes in federal Indian policy significantly affect tribes’ choice to amend their constitutions, with the number of amendments per tribe per year doubling during the so-called ‘Self-Determination’ period (1968–1988).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01319-9", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01319-9", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.02788584601020938}, {"title": "Qualitative Research: Advancing the Social and Behavioral Sciences", "authors": "Margaret R Roller, Zachary R Smith", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf035", "doi": "10.1093/poq/nfaf035", "journal_full": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.024811873281239905}, {"title": "Countering online abuse of politicians through information about consequences and norms", "authors": "Niels Bjørn Grund Petersen, Rasmus Tue Pedersen, Mads Thau", "abstract": "In recent years, a growing body of research has documented how both local and national politicians experience insults, sexism, and even threats on social media platforms.

Then, paradoxically, the possibility of divorce can increase the appeal of arranged marriages, by convincing young adults to accept the compromise with their parents. This is particularly true for women for whom divorce is the only possible exit out of a failed marriage (when men can entertain extra-marital affairs without social disapproval). To test these intuitions, we exploit a change in the divorce law in Belgium (introduction of no-fault divorce in 2007). On the basis of two unique sets of data on descendants of Turkish migrants (second-generation men and women), we find that the effect of this legal change on the incidence of arranged marriages (with “imported spouse”) and divorce differs between women and men.

In this essay, we describe the purpose of bank capital and the history of international standardsetting in bank regulation. We then highlight the most important aspects of the Basel Endgame, as well as the arguments for and against adopting the rule. We show that the debate unnecessarily conflated two distinct questions: (1) whether the United States should comply with international regulatory standards, and (2) whether the United States should raise large banks' capital requirements. While there are strong grounds to answer both questions in the affirmative, they need not be addressed together. That is, the United States can implement international standards in a capital-neutral manner to preserve global cooperation in bank regulation, leaving the separate question of raising capital requirements for another day.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1257/jep.20241434", "doi": "10.1257/jep.20241434", "journal_full": "Journal of Economic Perspectives", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01114866264878811}, {"title": "The Folk Economics of Housing", "authors": "Christopher S. Elmendorf, Clayton Nall, Stan Oklobdzija", "abstract": "Why is housing supply so severely restricted in US cities and suburbs? Urban economists offer two primary hypotheses: homeowner self-interest and political fragmentation. Homeowners, who outnumber and have organizational advantages over renters, are said to lobby against development to protect their property values. The fragmentation hypothesis emphasizes that development's negative externalities are borne locally while most of the benefits accrue regionally or nationally, leading localities to block housing. This paper offers another explanation: ordinary people simply do not believe that adding more housing to the regional stock would reduce housing prices. Across three original surveys of urban and suburban residents, only a minority of respondents say that a large, positive, regional housing supply shock would reduce prices or rents. These beliefs are weakly held and unstable (suggesting people have given the issue little thought), but respondents do have stable views about who is to blame for high housing prices: developers and landlords. Large, bipartisan supermajorities support price controls, demand subsidies, and restrictions on putative bad actors, policies which they believe would be more effective than supply liberalization for widespread affordability.

We identify a shock exogenous to firms’ export decisions by relying on preexisting lending relationships and exploiting the acquisition of a firm’s domestic bank by an internationalized banking group. Our results show that, after the acquisition, firms have a significantly higher probability of starting export in countries where the consolidated bank has a foreign branch, which proxies for the amount of information accumulated that can be shared with client firms. Conversely, the treatment effect on the intensive margins of export is largely insignificant.

Using STM allows us to identify socially meaningful themes, as highlighted by the respondents, and without bias from any predefined categories.

It explores the reflective accounts of 129 Syrian refugee university learners in Jordan, collected during the third week following the fall of Bashar al‐Assad, a period marked by significant political transition and the voluntary return of nearly 60 000 Syrians. Using a discursive analytical approach, the research investigates how language reflects the learners' decisions about returning to Syria or remaining in Jordan. The analysis identifies key language strategies, including the use of conditional framing to express hypothetical scenarios, modal verbs to convey future intentions, affective language that positions education as both a personal and collective responsibility, concessive structures to navigate the interplay of familial support, financial constraints, and educational aspirations, temporal framing that situates actions within a specific time context, a combination of agentive verbs, intensification, presupposition, and comparative evaluation. This study contributes to understanding the relationship between language, identity, and post‐conflict reconstruction in refugee contexts by highlighting the language strategies employed by Syrian refugee learners at a pivotal historical moment. It thereby advances sociolinguistic understandings of how refugee learners use language to frame return as a morally situated decision shaped by displacement, education, and political change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70088", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70088", "journal_full": "International Migration", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.8782658116068006}, {"title": "‘ Use my Experience to Your Advantage ’: The Agency Behind TikTok Portrayals of the Migration Journey Through Darien Gap", "authors": "Paula Folino Juanola", "abstract": "As migration routes and flows shift over time, so do the digital platforms through which migrants communicate and seek information. Among TikTok's billions of users, some individuals have shared footage of their crossing through the Darien gap between Colombia and Panama, offering a never-before-seen perspective to the 160 km jungle. This article explores TikTok's role as a tool for migrants to share unfiltered experiences and navigate the hardships of their journey . Through a comparative ethnographic content analysis (ECA) of 66 TikTok videos and, 7373 comments, this article proposes an original methodology seldom applied in migration research by prioritising migrant voices as a counter-space that actively resists those actors speaking for them. A thematic comparison between migrant-made videos with non-migrant-made videos considers how the latter accentuates narratives of suffering and victimhood; whereas migrant-made videos curate their content to provide practical information to support other migrants, grounded in their personal experience. The themes within migrant-made videos, together with their comments, construct a digital environment conducive to resisting flattening narratives through tools such as empowerment, community building, and practical information sharing. This article contributes beyond a methodological scope by acknowledging how migrant-made videos point to information individuals are seeking concerning their journey: an epistemological gap that, by filling it, could prove conducive to migrant protection strategies. It concludes that the decisive factor between agency-driven versus victimhood-centred content is the storyteller.

Unpacking Mechanisms Behind Colombia and Peru's Policies on Venezuelan Displacement", "authors": "Nieves Fernández-Rodríguez", "abstract": "While forced displacement policies are shaped by both international and domestic considerations, little is known about how states navigate conflicting pressures when adopting liberal or restrictive approaches. This article addresses this gap by examining the divergent responses of the two largest recipients of Venezuelan displaced people: Peru under Martín Vizcarra (2018–2020) and Colombia under Iván Duque (2018–2022). Although both Peru and Colombia are middle-income countries with significant emigration and share growing public resentment toward migrants and strained relations with Nicolás Maduro's regime, they pursued opposite policies. In 2019, Peru imposed a visa requirement for Venezuelan migrants, restricting access, whereas in 2021 Colombia created the Temporary Protection Status, allowing for regularization and a path to residency. Using 65 interviews with policymakers and experts, over 200 statements by public officials, and secondary literature, this study identifies the mechanisms behind these contradictory policies. It argues that whether forced displacement is perceived by executive actors as a foreign or domestic issue shapes the nature of policy in countries that would otherwise be expected to respond similarly. These perceptions are ultimately explained by executives’ need for self-preservation and self-legitimation within strategic political contexts. Four key factors—importance given to Venezuela, international reputation, executive strength, and, to a lesser extent, bureaucratic frameworks—determine whether foreign or domestic logics prevail.

At the same time, a large volume of research has focused on the foreign-born population, with relatively fewer studies including their native-born counterparts. As a result, little is known about how identities can enhance or risk the health of Asian Americans comparatively across generational status. In recognition of such gaps in existing literature, I use the 2016 National Asian American Survey ( n = 4,242) and examine how Asian/ethnic/American identity centrality moderates the relationship between generational status and self-rated health among Asian American adults, with gender as a key modifier. I find that Asian identity centrality operates as a health protective resource among foreign-born immigrants regardless of gender. In contrast, it functions as a risk to health among second-generation men and third-generation women. American identity centrality is also a risk to health, but specifically among 1.5- and second-generation men and women. Notably, ethnic identity centrality is detrimental to the health of 1.5-generation men. Findings reveal nuanced patterns of Asian American integration into U.S. society and their relationships to health.

We theorize that political institutions—particularly political parties—impede the sincere expression of legislative preferences among legislators that come from immigrant backgrounds. To begin, we present stylized facts about legislative behavior drawing on roll-call votes from the Canadian, British, and American legislatures. Drawing on 25 in-depth interviews with representatives, we find strong evidence that the threat of political party sanction and individual concerns about legislators’ own parties affects legislative decision-making.

We merge state contextual data on the welfare consumption rates of immigrants with micro-level public opinion data from the Cumulative American National Election Survey (CANES) for the years from 2004 to 2016. Our results suggest that individuals’ immigration attitudes and the degree of immigrant welfare participation in their home contexts combine to influence Americans’ welfare spending attitudes. More specifically, among individuals with unfavorable immigration attitudes, higher levels of immigrant welfare participation in their state contexts lead to significantly lower levels of welfare support. Likewise, in states with high-immigrant welfare participation rates, negative immigration attitudes have a stronger negative effect on welfare support.

Examining the political economy of Guatemalan migration to the Greater Los Angeles region and the activities of migrants and community organizations, I argue that neoliberal capitalism not only provokes the displacement of Guatemalan migrants as a social class of people from multiple racial and ethnic backgrounds, but it has also contributed to the emergence of distinct political Guatemalan diaspora organizations in the U.S. at the community, national, and transnational level. Furthermore, due to historical social relations in Guatemala, organizations have emerged in Southern California along ethnic, racial, and gender lines. Moreover, activism emerges within destination countries because exploitation and exclusion take on distinct forms beyond the specific economic and political forces that generate displacement in migrants’ origin countries. As such, these organizations have made significant contributions by safeguarding the human rights of Guatemalan migrants in the U.S. and have emerged based on the differences and inequalities faced by indigenous communities compared to non-indigenous (mestizo/ladino) groups as they and their organizations endure processes of “exclusionary inclusion” in the U.S.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10016", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10016", "journal_full": "Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9774732619354669}, {"title": "Harming by Interviewing?

Employing a life course perspective and the concept of “linked lives”, the analysis highlights how age, gender, family status, and structural conditions intersect across temporal and spatial scales.

Across nine economic games and judgment experiments (including four preregistered studies), we find that when third-party punishment is profitable, rates of cooperation decrease immediately and remain lower even when punishment outcomes are optimized to support cooperative behavior. Profitable third-party punishment causes targets of punishment to anticipate antisocial punishment and perceive social norms in terms of self-interest, suggesting that the introduction of payment degrades the communicative signals that punishment is meant to convey about punishers’ intentions and social norms. Critically, participants who would benefit from increased cooperation inadvertently reduce their own monetary compensation by opting in to experimental conditions that pay punishers, suggesting that they intuitively fail to consider the signaling consequences of profit motives to punish.

Over time, they became central gatekeeping tools in the college admissions process. However, these tests have faced growing criticism for reinforcing inequality and privileging structurally advantaged students, leading many colleges to eliminate them as admissions requirements. In this study, we extend insights from institutional theory and the study of higher education to develop a novel theory of how the potential diversity benefits of test-optional admissions are contingent upon institutional definitions of merit and competing financial priorities. More specifically, we argue that admissions offices’ claims regarding which criteria are most important to thinking about and evaluating merit can shape the outcomes of test-optional policies in systematic ways. Using data from several sources, including the National Center for Education Statistics’ Integrated Postsecondary Education System and the College Board’s Annual Survey of Colleges, we find that, while eliminating requirements generally leads to an increase in enrollment of underrepresented minority students, this effect is significantly reduced at institutions that continue to strongly value quantitative academic metrics in evaluations of merit. Moreover, when alternative institutional priorities such as financial pressures rise, diversity increases from test-optional policies tend to decline. These findings are especially salient in 2025, as institutions face mounting legal and political restrictions on diversity-related practices. Our findings suggest that the impact of policies like test-optional admissions—once viewed as viable alternatives to race-conscious practices—may be limited unless accompanied by shifts in how institutions define and reward merit.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251352432", "doi": "10.1177/00031224251352432", "journal_full": "American Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.38200951251827364}, {"title": "The political consequences of the mental load", "authors": "Ana Catalano Weeks", "abstract": "How do levels of cognitive household labour—the ‘mental load’ involved in anticipating, fulfilling, and monitoring household needs—affect political interest?

To test this argument, I field a novel survey on politics and household work to a sample of parents in the United States.

Low levels of mental load are positively linked to political interest, while high levels of mental load decrease interest in certain issues, including national politics and inflation.

By contrast, birth outcomes for Black and White infants gradually improved after truth-in-sentencing policies were adopted. The discordant findings point to distinct, countervailing mechanisms by which sentencing policies can affect population health. We provide suggestive evidence that three strikes policies adversely impacted Black birth outcomes through affective mechanisms, by inducing highly racialized, stigmatizing, and criminalizing public discourse around the time of policy adoption. Our results indicate that truth-in-sentencing likely impacted birth outcomes via material mechanisms, by gradually reducing community incarceration and crime rates.

The demographic reduction of this archetype through conflict leads to two primary consequences: a diminished geopolitical capacity for external power projection and a more docile, governable domestic population (the \"Governability Corollary\").

Political regimes are treated as strategic decision-makers holding flexible political options—such as repression, reform, policy shift, or exit—whose value evolves with volatility, entropy, and time. The core asset is the regime’s political capital, modeled as a dynamic stock S(t) subject to both gradual diffusion and sudden Poisson jumps representing exogenous shocks (e.g., coups, assassinations, natural death). Option exercise is constrained by an Action Cost Threshold X(t), the political strike price, which evolves over time and determines the cost–benefit feasibility of action. The framework introduces novel visualization and diagnostic tools: Opportunity Landscapes to map option exercise probabilities over volatility and time; Valence of Power heatmaps to measure relative option value; Decision Thresholds under Uncertainty curves linking entropy and action probabilities to reveal points of strategic equivalence; and Volatility Landscapes that integrate volatility, entropy, and probability to assess stability risk. We model the Decay Time Value of Political Capital Stocks and Political Options, quantify the Time Evolution of both S(t) and X(t), and use Cost–Benefit Landscapes to jointly evaluate capital and cost trajectories. The framework also captures coercion dynamics, distinguishing between rational coercion in dysfunctional equilibria and irrational coercion in stable democracies. Applied to Rwanda, South Sudan, and Uganda, the model produces empirical simulations of resilience, fragility, and optimal decision timing. In addition to capturing volatility and cost thresholds, the analysis introduces Regime Survivability Probabilities—quantifying the joint likelihood of sustaining or losing power under affordability and hazard constraints—and the Regime Survivability Frontier, which traces the tipping points where survival and failure probabilities converge. Results show how shifting volatility, erosion of political capital, and rising exit hazards shape strategic urgency and force leaders toward difficult trade-offs.

This study introduces the Patriarchy Index (PI), a new metric constructed from census microdata to capture gendered power hierarchies in families across 22 Asian and North African countries and 652 subnational administrative units. Of particular interest to development practitioners and scholars, the PI offers a scalable, lowcost tool for subnational diagnostics, especially where standard measures of gender equality are missing or fail to reflect private-sphere constraints on women’s autonomy. Our study addresses whether domestic arrangements—such as patterns of co-residence, marriage timing, and agebased authority—can reliably capture institutionalized patriarchy, and what regional variation these patterns reveal. Using harmonized IPUMS-I census microdata and eleven theoretically grounded indicators, we construct a multidimensional composite index empirically validated through convergence with existing gender measures, divergence from unrelated metrics, and correlation with gendered development outcomes. Our study finds that family-based patriarchy is spatially clustered and highly variable at the subnational level. It further shows that higher PI values are significantly associated with reduced relative female labor force participation, even after controlling for structural variables such as gross national income and urbanization. These results underscore the PI’s value as a complementary measure: it captures dimensions of gender inequality that remain invisible to public-facing or outcome-based indicators and helps bridge the gap between domestic constraints and broader patterns of disenfranchisement. In contexts where legal reform and female empowerment are pursued without addressing household-level structures, the PI offers a diagnostic that speaks directly to the architecture of family systems—illuminating where and how deeper constraints on gender equality endure.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m8f7b_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/m8f7b_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.023860583383449208}, {"title": "Progress in Building Livable Communities: What do the AARP Livability Data Show?", "authors": "Xue Zhang, Mildred E.

I argue that effects of different policies can be expected to vary across household contexts, due to the fact that the link between individual employment outcomes and in-work poverty is moderated by household type. The analyses uses data from EU-SILC and macro-level indicators from various sources to estimate general as well as household-type-specific effects using longitudinal methods. Results emphasize that labour market interventions and redistributive transfers impact in-work poverty risks through different mechanisms and also reveal important differences between specific policies: minimum wages contribute to reducing low-wage risks, whereas effects on in-work poverty are small and mainly restricted to single households where labour market outcomes and household income closely align. In contrast, there is a robust negative effect of strict employment protection legislation across almost all household types on in-work poverty, which is consistent with the positive role this measure plays for supporting higher earnings. With respect to redistributional policies, both unemployment benefits and benefits to low earners reduce poverty due to their contribution to public poverty-reduction. However, whereas unemployment benefits mainly reduce in-work poverty among couple households, benefits to low earners are the most effective measure to contribute to lower poverty risks among employed single parents.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4qynt_v3", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/4qynt_v3", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013603971878201504}, {"title": "Tell me more.

Also, high current levels of childlessness in these countries are an important reason why their cohort fertility is so low compared to England and some other countries of Northern and Western Europe (e.g. Sweden, France and the Netherlands).

Prior studies have largely examined stated intentions or the influence of extreme weather events, leaving open questions about actual fertility behaviour in relation to environmental concern. Method: Using individual-level panel data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS), we followed 11,951 women and 8,117 men from 2009 to 2022. We first use linear probability models and regress fertility expectations and parenthood status on the environmentalism index as measured in the first wave. We then estimate Growth Curve models to model the transition to parenthood across the life course for men and women who report different levels of environmentalism at the first wave. Results: Environmentalism is associated with slightly lower fertility expectations among younger adults, particularly those in their mid-20s to early 30s. Notably, the negative association is stronger when it comes to actual parenthood status. Women aged 25 to 40 with high environmentalism scores are significantly less likely to have children.

Past studies tend to focus on what immigrants and their children are (or are not) doing to adapt to local contexts, a focus which strengthens the perception that immigrants are a “problem” group. In this paper, we move the debate away from more familiar economic analyses to assess how destination type and exclusionary ordinances, defined as laws that restrict the rights of and services accorded to immigrant groups, influence “subjective” outcomes, including reports of discrimination among Mexican Americans. Our results reveal three main findings that illustrate the importance of local context. First, individuals living in a county with a greater share of co-ethnics report fewer experiences with discrimination. Second, in counties with an exclusionary ordinance, share of co-ethnics increases reports of discrimination. Finally, being born in the U.S. and speaking English do not provide protection from discrimination; rather, such characteristics shield Mexican Americans from discrimination only in supportive co-ethnic contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2s7wa_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/2s7wa_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.9954299241531175}, {"title": "Exit, my lord: High commissioners of Palestine's death coverage in local Hebraic newspapers", "authors": "Barak Bar-Zohar", "abstract": "This qualitative textual analysis explores the journalistic coverage of the deaths of eight British High Commissioners of Palestine between 1920 and 1948.

Modes of energy extraction and storage have historically played a pivotal role in the development of global capitalism. The shift from RES to fossil fuels in the 19th century caused a significant change in the relations between workers and capital. Since then, fossil fuels have been utilized as a dominant source of energy, reproducing specific abstract space and time that allowed capitalism to expand. However, this mode of energy has reached a limit and therefore, new ways of extracting, distributing, and consuming energy are sought. Due to the intermittent character of energy from RES increasing focus is oriented towards energy storage and its coordination via the information technologies. One of the predominant technologies for energy storage is apparently the battery. This paper analyzes the dynamics of energy valuation practices mediated by different types of batteries while it explores the battery as an information processing device rather than an energy source. The analysis focuses on three case studies of battery - the virtual battery, Bitcoin-as-battery, and Lithium-ion battery - while each case study focuses on a different aspect of the valuation process. Based on the case studies, three modalities of energy from RES are identified: account, waste, and stock. The virtual battery operates as an accounting device recording outputs and inputs of energy. It allows the semblance of delayed consumption. On the other hand, Bitcoin-as-battery transforms excess waste energy into a unique digital object with high liquidity on international markets. Lithium-ion battery allows energy from renewable sources to be stored and marketized in the form of stock. These modalities are a product of the valuation process, which aims to abstract the intermittent energy produced by RES and transform it into a commodified object.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3kgvn_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/3kgvn_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010716520884469838}, {"title": "Ideal Social Gas", "authors": "Vicente Morales", "abstract": "This work continues the one commenced in a previous one, where the key idea is that individual stances on a social matter can be modeled as positions of particles in physics.

The discipline is lacking in a comprehensive global bibliometric assessment, even though previous assessments have focused on narrative accounts or specific topics. Methods We performed a bibliometric study of 19,645 peer-reviewed publications on housing published from 1993 to 2022, sourced from Scopus. In accordance with PRISMA criteria, records were evaluated for relevance, and scient metric techniques co-word, co-citation, and co-authorship analyses were used using VOS viewer. Descriptive and network-based measures defined chronological, geographical, and thematic trends. Results The research identified five primary research themes: (1) affordability and inequality, (2) gentrification and displacement, (3) housing-health linkages, (4) sustainability and energy efficiency, and (5) financialization and global crises. The 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 epidemic significantly increased the prominence of sustainability and health, even though affordability and inequality were the most enduring focus issues. The United States, United Kingdom, and China were the primary contributors to global outputs, with Harvard University, Peking University, and University College London being notable institutions. The discipline remains methodologically constrained by its reliance on cross-sectional data and continues to exhibit regional bias in favor of the Global North, despite interdisciplinary growth. Conclusions This study provides the most comprehensive bibliometric mapping of housing research to date, with a focus on essential conceptual frameworks, collaborative networks, and research deficiencies.

The research was motivated by persistent underperformance and ethical challenges within Kenyan state agencies, often attributed to weak leadership and governance failures. Guided by theories including Ethical Leadership, Institutional Theory, Kohlberg’s Moral Development, and Social Learning Theory, the study employed a mixed-methods approach and a census sampling strategy targeting senior managers and board members of 135 state agencies. Data were collected using semi-structured questionnaires and analyzed through both descriptive and inferential statistics, including correlation and moderated regression analysis. The results revealed that leader empowerment behaviors—such as power-sharing, team building, and capacity development positively and significantly influenced agency performance. Furthermore, board composition, defined by factors such as expertise, gender parity, and independence, was found to significantly moderate the relationship between empowerment behavior and agency performance. The analysis confirmed that effective empowerment practices, when complemented by well-structured and diverse boards, fostered organizational accountability, service quality, and policy implementation. Despite these positive outcomes, challenges such as political interference and lack of merit-based appointments remained significant barriers to the realisation of effective ethical leadership.The study concluded that promoting empowerment behaviours and strengthening board governance were vital to enhancing the operational efficiency of state agencies.

Economic approaches to religion highlight the role of material conditions on people’s religious affiliation.

Many also infer material motivations to join a new religion from observed material outcomes, falling into the functionalist trap. Here, we present an econometric study of religious conversion by focusing on the relatively recent increase in non-Catholic Christianity in Chiapas, Mexico. This state has the most converts, as well as the poorest and least formally educated population in the country. This suggests formal education and material conditions influence religious conversion. To test this hypothesis, we analyze longitudinal data from the Mexican Population Census, spanning from 1950 to 2020, at the municipality level. To account for potential endogeneity between education or material conditions across waves, we implement a structural equation model for the analysis of longitudinal panel data. We fail to find a significant effect of material conditions or education (either positive or negative) on changes in religious affiliation in Chiapas. This may be due to the dampening effect of historical religious conflicts or differential exposure to Protestant missions, two variables omitted from our analysis for which no systematic data exists.

The paper presents a comparative analysis based on case studies from Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Croatia, and others. The central theses are: (1) regulatory systems based on the lowest common denominator of consensus risk undermining evidence-based standards and ethical obligations; (2) over-inclusive educational models may compromise treatment efficacy by legitimizing non-evidence-based practices; and (3) legal frameworks vary significantly in the extent to which they integrate universities, medical specialization, and professional oversight. Drawing on findings from the 2023 ACSTEC/SWPS survey and the 2025 EABCT Working Group update, the discussion addresses substantial diversity among countries regarding training requirements, recognised psychotherapy modalities, and eligibility for the professional title of psychotherapist, highlights the need for a thorough reflection on possible regulatory paths.

The transformation from a 27-dominant response regime to a simulated 42-dominant one is illustrated through comparative visualizations and theoretical modelling, reinforcing that AI does not choose—it reflects. This phenomenon challenges the myth of objectivity in AI, positioning LLMs as dynamic mirrors of human tendencies rather than autonomous arbiters of randomness.

However, formal models have yet to test the intuitive hypothesis that online social influence is sufficient to generate tangible, real-world effects on epidemics. We develop an agent-based model that incorporates social influencers into an epidemic scenario to test hypotheses about how the presence of competing influence messages affects the diffusion of health-protective behaviours throughout a population, and thereby alter the course and outcome of infectious disease epidemics.

As part of the Sangiran Formation, the site’s unique topography preserves a rich and uninterrupted sedimentary record spanning the Early to Middle Pleistocene. However, uncertainties in stratigraphic correlations, depositional environments, and geochronological frameworks have hindered a comprehensive understanding of the ecological contexts in which these hominins lived. This study aims to refine stratigraphy, clarify depositional settings, and establish a robust geochronological framework for Sangiran to better illustrate the paleoenvironmental dynamics that influenced Hominin ecology. Through detailed sedimentological analysis, facies characterization, and updated geochronological methods such as radiometric dating and paleomagnetic studies, this research provides a revised stratigraphic model for the Sangiran Formation. Key findings indicate a dynamic depositional environment, with fluvial, lacustrine, and volcaniclastic systems dominating at different chronological intervals. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions suggest that Homo erectus inhabited a diverse landscape of open grasslands, wetlands, and riparian corridors. Stable isotope data and faunal assemblages further support climactic shifts in temperature and weather accompanying such diverse ecological landscapes. These findings have significant implications for understanding hominin paleoecology in Sangiran. The reconstructed environments suggest that Homo erectus exploited varied habitats, demonstrating behavioral flexibility and resilience congruity in response to changing landscapes. The refined stratigraphy and geochronology also provide a more precise temporal framework for fossil occurrences, enabling better correlations with other Southeast Asian sites.

Arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) offers a promising approach to engage the public with complex health science. Methods: We evaluated the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a multi-site public exhibition co-developed by scientists, artists, and community members to convey DOHaD concepts. The exhibition, shown at five sites in a mid-sized Canadian city, featured professional and community-created artworks, scientific images, and interactive data collection activities. Using a parallel convergent mixed methods design, we collected and analyzed observational field notes, written reflections, QR code analytics, and structured activity responses across settings. Quantitative data were analyzed using logistic regression and descriptive statistics. Qualitative data underwent conventional content analysis. Findings were integrated narratively. Results: The exhibition was successfully installed across all sites, although space and security constraints in community settings required substantial adaptation. 89% of observed individuals at the gallery site engaged with the exhibition compared to 3-17% of observed individuals at community sites. Attendees at the gallery site also generally engaged with more artworks and for longer periods of time than at community sites. Viewing over half of the artworks was associated with a significantly greater odds of endorsing environmental and structural determinants of health (OR=10.3, 95% CI [1.48, 210.7]). Written and verbal feedback demonstrated increased awareness, emotional engagement, and a desire for further information. Despite some misinterpretation and low fidelity in interactive activities, the exhibition was broadly well-received and evoked critical reflection. Conclusions: This study provides the first empirical evaluation of an arts-based strategy to translate DOHaD concepts for public audiences, demonstrating that such approaches can enhance health literacy, foster dialogue about the social determinants of health, and support equitable public health communication about early life influences on lifelong health. Future efforts should optimize engagement in non-gallery spaces and assess longer-term impacts on attitudes and behaviours.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/czf29_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/czf29_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02062114217576838}, {"title": "Devolved Human Resources For Health And Service Delivery In County Government Hospitals In Kenya.", "authors": "Eunice Rosalyn Nyambura Muturi, Research Bridge publisher, Rose Litunya, Susan Were", "abstract": "This study investigates the impact of devolved human resources for health (HRH) on service delivery in Kenya's county government hospitals. Since the adoption of devolution in the 2010 Kenyan Constitution, healthcare functions have shifted from national to county governments, creating both opportunities and challenges. This study aimed to explore the extent to which devolved human resources for health affected service delivery in Kenya's county government hospitals. It sought to identify healthcare human resources for health challenges, evaluate the role of intergovernmental leadership, and propose strategies to enhance efficiency and service quality. The study employed a positivist research philosophy and mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) research design, analyzing data from 385 respondents across 137 county hospitals using SPSS version 27. The findings show that devolved human resources for health positively and significantly influenced service delivery. The moderating variable, intergovernmental leadership further strengthened this influence. The study concludes that devolved human resources for health influences service delivery. The study recommends that for service delivery to improve there is need for reform, as far as devolved human resources for health is concerned, as well as the need to enhance intergovernmental leadership. The study recommends the need for adequate staffing for both medical and non- medical staff, adhering to the organisation's staff establishment and that the employees be compensated commensurate with the services they render.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/evm9s_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/evm9s_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004490436417234567}, {"title": "The Enduring Influence of Albany’s Historic Streetcar Network on Modern Transit and Urban Form", "authors": "Nicholas Chiavini", "abstract": "Albany, New York’s historic streetcar network, decommissioned in 1946, played a central role in shaping the city’s development and the vestiges of this now defunct transit system are clearly visible. While much of the literature on the legacy of streetcar networks has focused on urban form and density, fewer studies have examined their continued influence on contemporary transit ridership and policy. This research investigates whether Albany’s former streetcar corridors continue to sustain elevated transit ridership and whether current land use and transportation policies effectively leverage this historic transit legacy. Using a mixed-methods approach, this research combines geospatial analysis, ridership data, demographic and land use trends, and policy review. A key component was the digitization of Albany’s 1923 streetcar network in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), enabling spatial comparisons with the city’s current transit conditions. Findings show that bus stops located along former streetcar routes experience significantly higher ridership than non-streetcar stops and are characterized by higher housing density and lower car ownership rates. These results reinforce earlier studies documenting the persistence of streetcar-era development patterns, particularly the concentration of density and transit-supportive land uses along former lines, while also extending the literature by directly connecting these legacies to present-day ridership. The Capital District Transportation Authority’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lines also largely align with these historic corridors, underscoring their continued importance as transit spines in the city. Despite these historic advantages, this research found that Albany’s zoning and land use regulations often fail to reinforce these corridors, permitting development patterns that undermine their transit potential. The results highlight the need for policies that integrate land use and transportation planning, ensuring that new development leverages the city’s streetcar legacy for contemporary transit success. The enduring influence of Albany’s streetcar network demonstrates how historic infrastructure continues to shape mobility patterns and offers lessons for cities seeking to strengthen transit-oriented development today.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r6nfh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/r6nfh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.05219989184842866}, {"title": "Bridging Global Climate Policies: Lessons for the United States from the EU and BRICS", "authors": "Tanush Bhardwaj", "abstract": "Climate change continues to escalate, yet the United States still sees limited legislative action due to political polarization and concerns over economic impacts. In contrast, many countries globally have taken pragmatic action, demonstrating the effectiveness of climate legislation when supported by unified political will. Prior studies of the international adoption of climate change legislation have shown that new policies have increasingly been implemented since the turn of the 21st century, with numerous factors affecting the rate of adoption. This study analyzes climate legislation adopted between 2000 and 2022 in European Union and BRICS countries to identify effective frameworks for adoption in the US. The countries were chosen to diversify the sample data by including differing economic drivers and political landscapes. Using a quantitative approach, this analysis consists of 91 multivariate linear regressions, to examine correlations between policy aspects—categorized by instrument, sector, type, and objective—and CO₂ emissions per capita. The models control for GDP per capita, population, fossil fuel percentage, and carbon pricing in order to validate comparison across countries. Findings reveal that policies involving tendering schemes, general legislative measures, low-carbon technology promotion, fuel switching, and climate adaptation are consistently associated with statistically significant reductions in emissions (p-value &lt; 0.05). The results suggest that a data-backed approach can contribute to bipartisan climate policy and highlight policy aspects which reduce emissions while supporting favorable economic outcomes. This research informs a policy proposal tailored to the US to serve as guidance for lawmakers in implementing effective climate policy measures.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rpqst_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/rpqst_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.012947008413411676}, {"title": "The Art of Translation: Arts-Based Knowledge Translation and its Application to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease", "authors": "Jordan Chin, Sara Dickinson, Luseadra McKerracher, Mary Barker, Stephan Dombrowski, Deborah Sloboda", "abstract": "Contemporary knowledge translation has reduced the knowledge-practice gap, however multifaceted, diverse approaches ensure that knowledge created by research endeavors reaches diverse audiences. Arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) can improve information accessibility and retention while fostering community engagement, cohesion, and collaborative problem solving. To address the limited available guidance on using ABKT and the resulting inconsistencies in practice, we present a practical framework for applying ABKT methods to research dissemination which we developed through a review of existing frameworks and their use in previous initiatives. Our framework guides users through key considerations for selecting and refining ABKT methods. Pre-established goals serve as the foundation for selecting ABKT methods and refinements should consider context-, people-, and project-related factors which influence the impact of ABKT initiatives. Process and outcome evaluations must be aligned with goals. We showcase the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) as a strong example of a field which may be readily communicated using ABKT. The complexity within the field of DOHaD, along with evidence supporting a need for multipronged dissemination strategies, makes DOHaD well suited to approaches that transcend social and cultural barriers and encourage reflection.

Yet an intriguing paradox was noticed in the fandom of One Piece: au- diences with queer-phobic views sometimes express intense affection for a queer-coded character. This study examines that contradiction through a qualitative analysis of 116 public comments across four Instagram reels featuring Bon Clay (Mr. 2) from One Piece, an ‘Okama’ (a Japanese trope of flamboyant gender nonconformity) whose arc is comedic, transgressive, and profoundly heroic. We identified a central pattern of queer exceptionalism, which is the conditional acceptance of one queer-coded character while rejecting queer identities in general, supported by four sub- themes: Exclusivity, Earned Respect, Dissonant Affection, and Rejecting Queerness. We draw on parasocial relationship theory, cognitive/vicarious dissonance, and rhetorical theory, and propose a phenomenon called Rhetorical Empathy: a mechanism in serialized storytelling where sustained exposure to prosocial story beats cultivates emotional attachment and temporarily contains under- lying prejudice. We discuss implications for anime/manga studies, queer media representation and outline limitations and future directions to advocate acceptance and empathy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/smd6f_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/smd6f_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.06551046505317037}, {"title": "Mastery Rubric for Scientific Thinking: A Cross-/Multi- Disciplinary Framework for Developing Independent Researchers", "authors": "Rochelle E. Tractenberg", "abstract": "The Mastery Rubric for Scientific Thinking (MR-ST) specifies a learnable, improvable set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) and performance stages that support rigorous, reproducible research across disciplines and data modalities. A Mastery Rubric (MR) is a curriculum development and evaluation tool that makes expected growth explicit by aligning KSAs to observable performance-level descriptors. MRs are developed to guide instruction, assessment, and program evaluation. Building on stewardship as a cross-disciplinary ideal and curriculum models developed for bioinformatics and for statistics/data science, the MR-ST defines eleven KSAs—ethical practice; prerequisite disciplinary knowledge; interdisciplinarity; problem definition via critical review; hypothesis generation; experimental/study design; identifying/collecting relevant data; selecting/using appropriate analytical methods; interpretation; drawing/contextualizing conclusions; and communication. Using cognitive task analysis and a guild-based developmental trajectory (Novice → Beginner → Apprentice → early Journeyman → late Journeyman), the Mastery Rubric for Scientific Thinking describes concrete, observable performance level descriptors featuring Bloom’s taxonomy and psychometric validity criteria. The MR-ST is designed to accommodate qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods, and to promote rigor and integrity in every domain. The MR-ST is strongly aligned with a systematicity view of scientific knowledge, supporting curricular outcomes about research that fit a flexible, modern characterization of science and contributions made to scientific knowledge. The result is a transparent, evidence-based tool for curriculum and instructional design, including targeted and actionable assessment, and program evaluation that makes independence and stewardship in research accessible and assessable from early undergraduate study through advanced professional preparation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wvpqx_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wvpqx_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007458287979274281}, {"title": "Human Extinction from a Probabilistic Demographic Perspective", "authors": "Betsy Alafoginis, David Swanson, Jeff Tayman", "abstract": "Studies that predict species extinction have focused on a range of flora and fauna but in regard to Homo sapiens there are, with one notable exception, no predictive studies, only considerations of possible ways this may occur.
