Examining the impact of the Trump administration’s metal tariffs on captive automobile lenders, we find that consumers received higher interest rates from captive lenders after the tariffs relative to unaffected noncaptive lenders. Further, we document a disparate impact on low-income borrowers and in areas with less lending competition. Our results suggest that tariffs may impact not only the price of goods but also the financing terms of purchases. Thus, focusing solely on directly affected product prices may underestimate tariff pass-through significantly.

The optimal form of segregate‐pair districting depends on the designer's popularity and the relative amounts of aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty.

When aggregate uncertainty dominates, the designer segregates moderate voters and pairs extreme voters; this “matching slices” plan has received some attention in the literature.

Through interviews with migration professionals from the Czech Ministry of the Interior, municipalities, integration centres, and NGOs, this study reveals contrasting institutional perspectives. The Ministry of the Interior frames Vietnamese migration as a security risk, linking it to illicit brokerage networks and justifying restrictive policies. Treating integration as secondary, it prioritizes control measures; NGOs and local actors highlight how exclusionary policies push migrants toward informal community structures for support.

This Pandora’s box logic suggests that states that are vulnerable to an unraveling of the status quo have incentives to restrain their territorial ambitions to preserve stability. This paper explores this claim theoretically and empirically. It provides descriptive evidence to determine whether vulnerability to territorial threats has historically been associated with a lower likelihood of initiating territorial disputes. We find some evidence of such an effect in postindependence Africa, where this logic is most frequently invoked, and to some extent in Asia, but not in other regions. To help explain these empirical observations, we develop a multistate model of territorial conflict that identifies the conditions under which cooperation to preserve the territorial status quo can be sustained. The model shows that while an equilibrium of mutual restraint can exist, the necessary conditions are quite restrictive, and this cooperative equilibrium is never unique. Thus while a Pandora’s box of potential claims can provide the basis for a norm of restraint, the emergence of such a norm is neither straightforward nor guaranteed.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0020818325101240", "doi": "10.1017/s0020818325101240", "journal_full": "International Organization", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013708850094658942}, {"title": "Delegating Destruction: Coercive Threats and Automated Nuclear Systems", "authors": "Joshua A.

Simultaneously, there is broad debate about the incorporation of automation via artificial intelligence into military systems, especially nuclear command and control. We develop a theoretical argument that nuclear threats implemented with automated nuclear launch systems are more credible compared to those implemented via non-automated means. By reducing human control over nuclear use, leaders can more effectively tie their hands and thus signal resolve, even if doing so increases the risk of nuclear war and thus is extremely dangerous. Preregistered survey experiments on an elite sample of United Kingdom Members of Parliament and two public samples of UK citizens provide support for these expectations, showing that in a crisis scenario involving a Russian invasion of Estonia, automated nuclear threats can increase credibility and willingness to back down.

Using declassified surveillance reports from 1970s Taiwan, we find that protection is most likely when informants are close to well-connected dissidents, interact with behind-the-scenes activists, or provide sensitive information about internal conflicts. Deeply embedded informants offer high-value intelligence but face greater risks of exposure, making them especially worth protecting.

As predicted and preregistered, we find greater support for action to mitigate health-based LGBTQ inequality, compared to economics and belonging.

While numerous studies have found socioeconomic factors to be significantly associated with premature death everywhere in the world, the debate on the relative effect of such factors on mid-age (15 to 59 ages) has not received enough attention, particularly in low-income countries, where this question is pertinent due to scant resources in the healthcare sector. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the India Human Development Survey, we assess the relative importance of individual- and community-level education vs. income and wealth in India, where approximately 3 million premature deaths occur annually in mid-ages. We find a clear downward gradient in mid-age mortality with increasing education within each wealth category, whereas no consistent mortality advantage with increasing wealth status is visible within education subgroups. Multilevel logistic regression models show that the decline in the risk of death across the education spectrum by far exceeds (14% for male and 13% for female) the decline moving along the wealth distribution, even after controlling for other relevant demographic, socioeconomic, regional variables. Along with the direct effect of individual-level educational attainment, we also find a protective effect of education at the community level, particularly for women.

Here, we tested these predictions using EEG data from the Bucharest Early Intervention Project, a randomized controlled trial of foster care as an alternative to institutionalized care. Trial-by-trial EEG residuals during a Flanker task were modeled as a linear dynamical system, and changes in eigenvalue magnitude were tracked across adolescence. Across all groups, eigenvalues decreased with age, consistent with maturation of recurrent computations.

These problems can be modeled with public goods games. To facilitate such an analysis, many studies assume the game is symmetric. Group members have the same means to cooperate (equal endowments), and contributions of different group members are equally effective (equal productivities). Studies that allow for some inequality tend to focus on one kind of inequality only. In practice, however, people can be unequal in many ways. The effect of these inequalities may in turn depend on the specific public goods game considered. To explore these issues, we combine a large-sample experiment with extensive theoretical work. We systematically vary four aspects: the group members’ endowments, their productivities, group size, and whether the public goods game exhibits linear returns or returns given by a threshold function. By exploring all four aspects, we obtain a unique dataset to explore the effect of asymmetry on cooperation. Based on this dataset, we study whether there is an advantage of “aligned inequality”: whether groups achieve a better surplus if more productive individuals have a larger endowment. For public goods games with linear returns, we find such an advantage, thereby corroborating previous research. If returns follow a threshold function, however, aligned inequality results in inferior payoffs. These results show that the effect of inequality on cooperation depends on the kind of public goods game considered.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2525760123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2525760123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007089263881310481}, {"title": "Toddlers expect ingroup loyalty to override personal preferences when outgroups are present", "authors": "Lin Bian, Renée Baillargeon", "abstract": "When outgroups are present, adults may endorse ingroup choices that are at odds with their personal preferences, in an outward show of ingroup loyalty. Here, we examined whether 2-y-old toddlers ( N = 108) might already understand such shows of loyalty. In three violation-of-expectation experiments, toddlers watched interactions among a target individual, an ingroup member, and an outgroup member; group memberships were marked with novel labels. In the critical trials, the target individual chose between an ingroup- and an outgroup-associated toy. When the outgroup member was present during this selection process, toddlers expected the target individual to conform to her group’s norm and select the ingroup-associated toy, even when they knew she preferred the outgroup-associated toy. This was true whether or not the ingroup member remained in the scene; as long as the outgroup member was present, toddlers expected the target individual to select the ingroup-associated toy and no other toy. When the outgroup member was absent, however, toddlers expected the target individual to act on her personal preference, if any. They also held this expectation if no information was provided about group memberships. Together, these results indicate that by 2 y of age, toddlers a) construe individuals as possessed of both a personal and a social identity, b) understand that individuals may produce different actions in different contexts depending on which identity has precedence, and c) expect individuals’ social identity to take precedence in intergroup contexts even when it conflicts with their personal identity, in a show of ingroup loyalty.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2521041123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2521041123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008279954004042911}, {"title": "The socioeconomic returns to citizenship: A randomized controlled trial", "authors": "Jens Hainmueller, Elisa Cascardi, Michael Hotard, Rey Koslowski, Duncan Lawrence, Vasil Yasenov, David D.

We leverage a randomized experiment from New York where low-income registrants with permanent residency who wanted to become citizens entered a lottery to receive fee vouchers to naturalize. Voucher recipients were about 36 p.p. more likely to naturalize. Yet, we find no discernible effects of access to citizenship on multiple economic outcomes, including income, credit scores, access to credit, financial distress, and employment. Leveraging a multidimensional immigrant integration index, we similarly find no measurable effects on noneconomic integration. However, we do find that citizenship reduces fears of deportation. Explaining divergence from past studies, our results also reveal evidence of positive selection into citizenship, suggesting that observational studies are susceptible to selection bias.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2516178123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2516178123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9197980133110936}, {"title": "Dynamics of memory B cells and plasmablasts in healthy individuals", "authors": "Andrea Mazzolini, Aleksandra M.

This article explores the reasons behind the failure of PRRPs to gain traction, focusing on the supply side of party competition and developing a more nuanced conceptualization of polarization. It argues that, at a critical moment when PRRPs were growing elsewhere, Scotland’s political landscape was shaped by symbiotic polarization, in which two established and opposing parties – the Scottish National Party (SNP) and the Scottish Conservative Party – reinforced each other’s positions, entrenched by the Scottish independence and Brexit referendums. This dynamic constrained the emergence of PRRPs. Since 2022, however, this political balance has fractured, creating space for a disruptive polarizing force on the populist radical right.

Our analysis confirms the growing significance of technocrats – particularly the ‘academic technocrat’ – since the onset of the crisis, a trend that aligns with observations also evident in other European countries.

Previous research indicates that elections and referenda can both lower losers’ satisfaction with democracy and increase that of the winners. As long as people win some in addition to losing some, there appears to be little concern that satisfaction will polarize along partisan lines. However, for once-in-a-generation referenda such as Britain’s EU Referendum, there is little chance for losers to chalk up a compensatory win, potentially exacerbating and solidifying the winner-loser gap. This research note extends previous research into the consequences of Britain’s EU Referendum on satisfaction with democracy by analyzing 5 years of panel data across the Brexit period—from the referendum announcement through to the UK’s exit from the EU. Our analyses demonstrate dramatic swings in winners’ and losers’ satisfaction with democracy across those 5 years, often corresponding with Brexit-related events. Most tellingly, after the United Kingdom finally left the EU, there is a notable, though modest, continuation of the winner-loser gap initially triggered by the EU Referendum outcome—suggesting once-in-a-generation referenda can durably fracture democratic satisfaction in ways regular elections do not.

While existing scholarship on democratic diffusion primarily focuses on how democratization influences authoritarian regimes, it often overlooks the cross-border effects on neighboring democracies. This study addresses this gap by investigating the impact of democratic transitions on party polarization and the issue salience of democracy in countries with democratic or hybrid regimes. Using the Manifesto Project and V-DEM’s regime transitions data sets and employing a difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment adoption, our analysis reveals a counterintuitive effect: democratic transitions in one country leads to a decrease in party polarization over democracy in neighboring countries. We posit this decline is a long-term phenomenon, linked to the diminishing salience of democracy as a key issue in party manifestos after a short period of initial prominence. By shifting the scholarly focus of diffusion effects to party politics within democratic and hybrid regimes, we contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how democratization ripples beyond its borders, shaping the political landscape in unanticipated ways.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00323217251412065", "doi": "10.1177/00323217251412065", "journal_full": "Political Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01634561177613736}, {"title": "Internationalizing Industrial Policy: How China and the United States Use State Capacity to Secure Critical Minerals for Electric Vehicles", "authors": "Daniel Driscoll, Max Kiefel, Mathias Larsen", "abstract": "Industrial policies are resurging across the world in response to climate change and geopolitical challenges. Current scholarship predominantly argues that state capacity for industrial policy depends on nationally oriented features, such as bureaucratic efficiency, financial resources, and expertise. However, the increasing uncertainties in globalized industrial supply chains mean that today, industrial policies must often expand into other countries to be successful. We propose complementing the domestically oriented dimension of state capacity with an internationally oriented one, drawing from the international political economy literature on state power. To demonstrate the merit of this approach, we analyze China's and the United States’ state capacity and actions to internationalize their electric vehicle industrial policies, in order to secure critical minerals. We find that both countries use their large market shares of global trade, while China leverages its powerful state bureaucracy and the United States its dominant military and macrofinancial regime. Thus, we argue that in order for a country to internationalize its industrial policy, a country must combine market dominance with capacities that are likely to be highly specific to their own comparative advantage.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00323292251411593", "doi": "10.1177/00323292251411593", "journal_full": "Politics & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009519182804023862}, {"title": "Robust Public Governance in a Turbulent Era: Theoretical Framework and Empirical Experiences.

Using data from 482 California cities between 2015 and 2023, we find that cities with stronger fiscal capacity, more climate‐concerned, and whiter populations are more likely to institutionalize burden reduction practices in streamlining ordinances. Contrary to expectations, neither mass political ideology nor political leader (mayoral) partisanship has a significant impact on municipal permitting reforms.

Using data on 3223 PPP projects across 91 countries from 1998 to 2022, we establish longitudinal networks and measure three types of positional advantages: linkage, brokerage, and independence. Our results show that greater institutional distance is associated with the accumulation of these advantages over time. Moreover, host countries' involvement in economic‐political alliances moderates these relationships in contrasting ways, weakening the effect on linkage and brokerage advantages while strengthening the effect on independence advantages.

Using survey data collected from officers in a state‐level law enforcement agency in 2021, we find that White officers, as well as those who reported greater stress during the 2020 protests, express stronger concerns about being perceived as racist. These concerns are associated with elevated levels of burnout, and efforts to maintain a positive self‐image partially mediate this relationship. These findings hold even after controlling for burnout levels reported by the same officers in 2019.

Nominal wage stickiness incentivizes workers to engage in job-to-job transitions after an unexpected increase in the price level. Such dynamics lead to a rise in aggregate vacancies associating a seemingly tight labor market with lower real wages—two facts observed during the recent inflation period. The calibrated model jointly matches aggregate and cross-sectional trends in worker flows and wages during the 2021-2024 period. Using historical data, we show that prior periods of high inflation were also associated with increasing vacancies and upward shifts in the Beveridge curve.

Using US data from 1980 to 2016, we find evidence of sizable rent dissipation and reduced within-group wage dispersion due to automation. Automation accounts for 52% of the increase in between-group inequality since 1980, with rent dissipation explaining one-fifth of this total.

Combining variation in rainfall and the staggered rollout of IBLI in Kenya over the 2000-2020 period, we find that IBLI strongly reduces drought-induced conflict. Key mechanisms include a reduction in herd sizes, as well as income smoothing and asset-price stabilization, contributing to an overall reduced migratory pressure for pastoralists. Our study suggests that market-based solutions are a scalable, cost-effective pathway to mitigate conflict, complementing political solutions such as power-sharing agreements and institutional reforms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjag005", "doi": "10.1093/qje/qjag005", "journal_full": "Quarterly Journal of Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03083611850429613}, {"title": "Dynamic Regulation with Firm Linkages: Evidence from Texas", "authors": "Matthew Leisten, Nicholas Vreugdenhil", "abstract": "We evaluate the efficiency of dynamic linked environmental regulation. Linked regulation allows inspectors who uncover violations at one plant to increase future enforcement at other plants that share a common owner. When compliance costs are correlated, regulators can then target scarce enforcement resources towards bad actors without inspecting everyone. We develop an empirical framework of dynamic moral hazard under linked regulation that allows for large portfolios of plants and for choices to be interdependent within the portfolio of plants and across time. Using the framework we evaluate a linked regulation scheme in Texas and find that linked regulation performs substantially better than both unlinked regulation and untargeted regulation. We test two alternative theoretical mechanisms that underpin the benefit—a “firm-wide moral hazard mechanism” and a “correlated targeting mechanism”—and find that a large share of the value of linked regulation is due to the former.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdag013", "doi": "10.1093/restud/rdag013", "journal_full": "Review of Economic Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0049276517074210435}, {"title": "Organizational Change and Reference-Dependent Preferences", "authors": "Klaus M Schmidt, Jonas von Wangenheim", "abstract": "Reference-dependent preferences can explain several puzzling observations about organizational change.

Previously, lack of data on early industrial hazards contributed to a structural division between urban and environmental theory, as sociologists have had limited understanding of the relationship between environmental and racial inequality during the initial formation of segregated neighborhoods. As a result, socioenvironmental processes are often considered a downstream outcome of persistent patterns of urban inequality, rather than a potential cause. In response, this study uses a novel computational methodology to map sites associated with an acute and widespread source of early industrial pollution. Site data are paired with historical census information to analyze changes in the social stratification of environmental exposure in six US urban areas from 1880 to 1930. Results reveal a sustained and generalized escalation in exposure to environmental hazards among racialized populations, despite substantial local variation at the beginning of the study period, suggesting that racial-environmental inequality emerged much earlier than prior studies have shown—and that socioenvironmental processes likely played an important role in the racialization of the neighborhood. Findings further suggest new directions to embed urban sociology within a socioenvironmental perspective.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag001", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag001", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06182707227050066}, {"title": "Conspiracy talk in the lives of ordinary Americans: everyday experiences of conspiracy culture in contemporary America", "authors": "Niko Pyrhönen, Gwenaëlle Bauvois, Anton Berg, Peter Holley", "abstract": "This paper examines how ordinary Americans engage in unprompted conspiracy talk when discussing their daily lives. Drawing on a representative sample of 1,612 life course interviews from the “American Voices Project”, we explore how conspiracy theories surface in reflections on topics people consider important—such as relationships, employment, religion, and politics. Using both computational and qualitative analysis, we identify instances of conspiracy talk in the corpus, and categorize these passages into three orientations: supporting, challenging, and referencing conspiracy talk. Notably, 10 percent of the interview transcripts contain some form of conspiracy talk—a striking figure given that no questions about conspiracies or conspiracy theories were asked. While the overall volume of conspiracy talk rose during the pandemic, this increase was largely driven by a fivefold increase in passages that challenge conspiracy theories. Building on the recent theoretical work on conspiracy theories and conspiracy culture, this study highlights the value of empirically grounded analysis focused on ordinary people—not just dedicated conspiracy theorists or participants in, or followers of, the conspiracy theory milieu. In doing so, we offer new insights into how conspiracy theories are discussed, negotiated, and made meaningful in the course of everyday life.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soag002", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soag002", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.018079684201173674}, {"title": "Review of “Sociology Meets Memoir: An Exploration of Narrative and Method”", "authors": "Mariana Craciun", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf222", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf222", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.030853913166705382}, {"title": "Household production time and inequality in material living standards in the U.S., 1965–2018", "authors": "Leila Gautham, Nancy Folbre", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105582", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105582", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008364846690789407}, {"title": "Human capital, unequal opportunities and productivity convergence: A global historical perspective, 1800–2100", "authors": "Nitin Bharti, Amory Gethin, Thanasak Mark Jenmana, Zhexun Mo, Thomas Piketty, Li Yang", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105578", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105578", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.029738593331431584}, {"title": "The unequal job security scars of displacement", "authors": "Ana Figueiredo, Olivier Marie, Agnieszka Markiewicz", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105562", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpubeco.2025.105562", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03129578461214544}, {"title": "Fiscal capacity and capital misallocation: the economic costs of tax evasion", "authors": "Yu Liu, Xiaoxue Zhao", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105581", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpubeco.2026.105581", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009496860417912978}, {"title": "Editorial Board", "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/s0047-2727(26)00022-8", "doi": "10.1016/s0047-2727(26)00022-8", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0024946187838256195}, {"title": "The Objective Value of Childrearing", "authors": "Danielle Levitan", "abstract": "Most countries legally recognize the right and duty to raise the child one has carried and given birth to, (i) reflecting a traditional legal presumption (despite widespread abuse and neglect) that parents should be granted wide‐ranging legal rights with respect to their minor children. What interests me here is the moral aspect of the right to childrearing: does childrearing have a value that is objective, and if so, why? In this paper, I explore a theory of intrinsic value that is consistent with an objective stance on childrearing. The theory enables us to make sense of the belief that something can be objectively good as an end‐in‐itself even if a person derives no pleasure from it, thus grounding the distinction between the good of childrearing and the pleasure one might gain from it. This paper is divided into three parts. Section 1 explores the concept of intrinsic goodness. I explain what I mean by ‘childrearing’ as distinguished from procreation, and argue that childrearing is both an objective and intrinsic good. Section 2 clarifies how this works, maintaining that the intimate relationship between parent and child makes the parent's life richer and more worthwhile. (ii) I argue further that childrearing is a component of well‐being rather than an instrumental cause of it. Section 3 sketches three types of theories outlined by Derek Parfit (iii) regarding what is good for a person: hedonistic theories, desire‐fulfilment theories, and objective‐list theories (iv).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/papa.70012", "doi": "10.1111/papa.70012", "journal_full": "Philosophy & Public Affairs", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007364938790084263}, {"title": "Disentangling and Reassembling: Unveiling Hidden Patterns in Gender Attitudinal Surveys", "authors": "Jiayun Jin", "abstract": "This study addresses the complexities of midpoint and non-substantive responses, such as “Don’t Know,” in Likert scale surveys on gender attitudes.

Analysis of data from the Chinese General Social Survey shows that traditional gender attitudes are associated with a higher likelihood of such responses, indicating biases in conventional methods. After disentangling these elements, I reassemble them through latent profile analysis to examine the dominant configurations of gender attitudes and response tendencies. Five distinct profiles emerge: Passionate Egalitarians, Genuine Neutrals, Forthright Moderates, Evasive Traditionalists, and Unembellished Traditionalists.

In this research note, we examine whether the Texas migrant busing program led to an increase in Hispanic homelessness in cities that received buses chartered by the state. Using point-in-time data measuring local homeless populations from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and administrative data from the Office of the Texas Governor to identify busing destinations, we apply a series of fixed-effects individual slope models to estimate the impact of Texas's busing program on local rates of Hispanic homelessness. We find that the busing program led to an annual increase of 36% in Hispanic homelessness in destination cities relative to prebusing trends. These results are robust to counterfactuals showing that the busing program had no impact on non-Hispanic homelessness, consistent with the predominantly Hispanic composition of bused migrants.

Despite their recognized importance, there is scant population-based research estimating the prevalence of great-grandparents in the contemporary United States. This research note uses the most recently available nationally representative survey data to characterize great-grandparenthood in the United States from 1996 until 2012, when the Health and Retirement Study ceased asking harmonizable great-grandparenthood questions. The prevalence of great-grandparenthood increases steadily with age, from 11% of 60‒64-year-olds, to just over half at ages 80‒84, to about two thirds of those 90 or older. There has been surprising little change over the cohorts prior to the baby boom, but cohorts born after 1942 have lower rates of great-grandparenthood in their 50s and early 60s. Great-grandparenthood is somewhat more prevalent among women than men and is strongly patterned by educational attainment, with distinct patterns and levels for those with and without a college degree. Finally, we estimate that the number of great-grandparents in the United States has increased from 15.3 million in 1996 to 20.4 million in 2012, highlighting a 33% increase.

However, the validity of EMA for measuring features of daily life—what people are doing, where, and with whom—remains uncertain. A key challenge is the lack of consensus across studies about how validity in EMA methods is defined and assessed. The authors address that gap by comparing EMA data (n = 1,174) with time diary data (n = 1,113) using two population-based samples. An advantage of large samples is the ability to evaluate the magnitude of bias rather than relying solely on p-values, as is common in small-sample studies. The authors find that both methods yield similar estimates of moments captured at home and in the workplace, supporting their validity in those contexts. However, EMA tends to overestimate moments spent alone compared with time diaries, likely because of moment selection bias. Moreover, large discrepancies in estimates for eating and drinking and household chores suggest that relying on primary activity reports can introduce significant bias for multitasked activities. Comparing these methods provides insight into their relative strengths and limitations, helping researchers assess the validity, potential biases, and interpretive implications of each across key domains of daily life.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00811750261419100", "doi": "10.1177/00811750261419100", "journal_full": "Sociological Methodology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007235008984279756}, {"title": "Race, gender, and party in EEOC cases, 1996–2006: Assessing the role of judge attributes in case outcomes in the US district courts", "authors": "Sean Farhang, Gregory J.

We find that legislators prioritize policy work as they gain institutional power (e.g., become a committee chair) but simultaneously maintain their levels of constituency service. Moreover, when a new legislator replaces an experienced legislator, the district receives less constituency service and less policy work.

The article proposes novel theoretical extensions, including emotional anchoring of policymakers , affective policy subsystems , and affective brokerage , to better capture the mechanisms through which emotions shape coalition membership, often independently of or prior to belief alignment. To the extent that emotional anchoring is durable, its effect can persist over time, shaping coalition stability, strategic behavior, policy‐oriented learning, and policy change.

This occurred through the establishment, upgrading, and gradual expansion of local colleges across the country, especially in female-dominated fields associated with work in expanding welfare sectors. Previous research has suggested that the gendered profile of educational expansions contributed to the cementing of horizontal gender segregation patterns in education and the labour market. We shed light on these processes using new and detailed data on the establishment and upgrading of higher educational institutions between 1969 and 1992.

Shifting attention to the latter, we argue that individual preferences over the allocation of welfare spending depend on their relationship to economic vulnerability. Individuals in secure economic situations support schemes with benefits proportional to contributions, while those in more vulnerable positions favour systems based on recipient need. These heterogeneous preferences translate into public evaluations of policymaker performance, providing a pathway for the electoral connection. We test this argument in two stages. First, we use data from the European Social Survey to examine how individual precarity shapes preferences for needs-based versus contributory pensions. Second, we use the Executive Approval Database to assess how the composition of pension expenditures and perceptions of debt affect government support across eleven European welfare states from 1986 to 2019.

But what enables or constrains politicians to perform such leadership? To date, little is known about the factors influencing politicians’ willingness to advocate for decarbonisation measures in the short-term for the long-term gain of climate change mitigation. This study draws on rare data of consumers’ carbon footprints, parliamentary speechmaking, and qualitative elite interviews in a mixed-methods research design to study how the intensity of constituents’ consumption-based carbon emissions influences the decarbonisation-focused behaviour of members of parliament (MPs) in the UK. Our quantitative findings reveal that MPs pay considerably less attention to decarbonisation issues when they represent carbon-intense constituencies. Moreover, this effect is particularly pronounced for Conservative MPs and amplified in marginal seats. The qualitative interview evidence helps to contextualise these quantitative findings, suggesting that MPs consider the decarbonisation of lifestyles a crucial political challenge and that their electoral considerations and party-political contexts play an important role in how they handle this challenge.

This study addresses that gap by analysing how Sweden’s accession to the European Union (EU) in 1995 altered the patterns of parliamentary opposition. Using longitudinal data on government proposals in the Swedish parliament, 1970–2022, we apply a difference-in-differences design to compare opposition intensity before and after accession. Our findings reveal two major transformations. First, we identify a sustained decline in opposition in internationally embedded economic and tax policies, supporting the view that the EU political system structurally depoliticises economic governance. Second, we observe a gradual but pronounced politicisation in policy areas tied to national identity and social welfare, where EU competences are limited and domestic discretion remains. We thus find that European integration reshapes parliamentary conflict by dampening opposition in economic policymaking while intensifying contestation in policy areas related to national identity and social protection. Rather than reducing opposition overall, EU membership redirects it across issue areas. Taken together, the results show that the distribution of national and supranational competences conditions parliamentary opposition. As Sweden is a most likely case of EU-induced cleavage transformation, similar dynamics are likely across other member states as well. The study advances parliamentary research by shifting attention from formal powers and debates to observable opposition behaviour over time. It also adds to theories of modern-day cleavage formation by providing evidence that European integration reduces conflict in economic policy while intensifying identity-based divides.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1475676526100711", "doi": "10.1017/s1475676526100711", "journal_full": "European Journal of Political Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03469760536397637}, {"title": "How policy narratives shape sustainability governance: a case study of urban transport policy discourse", "authors": "Mario Angst, Neitah Noemi Müller, Viviane Walker, Myriam Pham-Truffert", "abstract": "Recent research in sustainability science has highlighted the crucial role of imaginaries, stories and narratives in shaping how sustainability governance is understood.

This article examines how these trajectories can help analyse sustainability policy making when viewed through the theoretical lens of the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF). To do this, we reinterpret the sustainability trajectories as policy paradigms and identify the broader cultural and institutional macro-level narratives that underpin them. We ask how these overarching sustainability policy paradigms shape the way specific sustainability-related policy processes unfold. Empirically, we analyse how macro-level narratives within the modernization and transformation paradigms influence local policy discourse on sustainable urban transport in the Swiss city of Zürich over a 12-year period. Methodologically, the study introduces an innovative approach for assessing how actors’ ideal-typical discourse network positions align with macro-level narratives, and how these patterns structure actual policy discourse networks. Our findings provide some evidence that macro-level narratives do influence the structure of policy discourse.

Incumbent members of licensed occupations gain from the higher wages caused by licensure policies, creating a strong incentive for them to push for stricter regulations and resist any efforts to remove or loosen licensure requirements.

To understand why, we focus on the role of family institutions, particularly marriage and inheritance customs.

The actions of large employers in an occupation or industry affect local and national wages, employment and output.

Where cohort birth rates have fallen low, they have not subsequently rebounded. We show that both increasing rates of lifetime childlessness and smaller family sizes among parents have contributed to falling cohort birth rates.

We showcase four applications: (a) forced alignment of audio text using MFCCs, time-stamping transcripts, and speaker information; (b) speech characterization using LLDs; (c) custom-made classification models with audio embeddings and MFCCs; and (d) emotional recognition models using Wav2Vec for classification of discrete emotions and their valence-arousal dominance.

In this context, the authors have been wondering to what extent they can interact autonomously on the international stage, and what tools do national governments use to shape and control their actions? This paper uses the meta-governance approach to examine intergovernmental relations in the context of cities’ international relations. The authors reveal that states mostly rely on a full range of hands-off tools rather than hands-on ones.

While we find that Chega does indeed receive more media attention than other comparable parties, especially during election times, no such pattern can be detected for VOX. Concerning attention given to leaders, measured as salience and personalization index, we confirm that André Ventura, leader of Chega is given disproportionate attention, while that is not the case for VOX’s Santiago Abascal.

In contexts where elites have been highly closed over time, further increases are expected to erode trust. In more open systems, by contrast, closure may be positively associated. Our analysis combines LAPOP data (2004–2018) with PELA-USAL elite indicators in a large-N comparative framework. Estimates from hierarchical models indicate that elite closure—characterized by legislative re-election rates and family ties in politics—significantly reduces political trust.

Participants were current and former users with different sexual orientations and a diverse age range (18–34 years old), and predominantly Portuguese. The thematic analysis presented how users likened their dating app interactions to games, identifying specific gamified features, and describing their adaptation and engagement in strategic practices to enhance appeal. Despite the uniform platform system and rules, traditional gender scripts endure and dictate a binary dynamic where men are seen as initiators and women as selectors. The findings reveal tensions between gamification’s homogenizing effect and enduring socio-cultural scripts, illustrating how platform design affordances and social norms structure dating experiences.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/14614448251413709", "doi": "10.1177/14614448251413709", "journal_full": "New Media & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015556981198175057}, {"title": "What does the news say about Siri, Alexa, and co.?

Through ethnographic fieldwork with the Bangladeshi diaspora, it examines how diversity is lived, negotiated and reconfigured in the spaces of daily interaction. Building on the concept of ‘commonplace diversity’, the study highlights how routine public encounters—especially in schools, parks and local commerce—foster recognition and coexistence, while often stopping short of deeper intercultural intimacy. The analysis reveals a gendered dynamic in which Bangladeshi women, particularly mothers, act as informal socio‐cultural brokers in the public sphere, while men remain largely confined to ethnic networks. Crucially, by introducing the notion of relational hybridization , the article demonstrates that second‐generation children are more likely to shift intercultural relations into the private and affective sphere, cultivating friendships and emotional proximity across ethnic lines. These practices do not merely intensify existing ties but alter the social meaning of difference by relocating interculturality into domains of intimacy. These children generate hybrid forms of belonging that challenge both community conservatism and societal exclusion.

Results show that settlement intentions are unevenly distributed, with northern and northwestern regions showing higher intentions than southern regions. The meso‐system (workplace and family context) exerts the most pronounced influence on settlement decisions. Short‐distance migration and higher local minimum wages consistently strengthen women's willingness to settle. By contrast, accumulated household difficulties and elevated crime levels substantially weaken settlement intentions. Notably, several influences are nonlinear: moderate working hours enhance settlement willingness, but excessive hours quickly erode it, and air pollution becomes a decisive deterrent once the AQI exceeds 100.

The escalating debt crisis can hinder investments in climate adaptation and mitigation, while climate‐related disasters can further exacerbate debt burdens. By delving into the complex interplay between debt and climate change, this paper explores their historical intersection, examining how these interconnected issues have shaped global inequalities. It delves into the literature on the historical context of debt accumulation in developing countries, the role of international financial institutions, and subsequent efforts to address debt burdens. The concept of “climate debt”—the notion that developed nations bear a responsibility to developing countries for their historical emissions—is critically assessed. The paper further evaluates the potential of debt relief as a mechanism for achieving climate justice, enabling developing countries to redirect financial resources towards climate‐resilient development and address the enduring legacies of colonialism and unequal development. Finally, through case studies of debt relief programs, the paper explores their implications for climate action, focusing on their capacity to contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future. The paper makes a key contribution to a more informed discourse on how debt relief can be used to address climate change, offering practical insights for policymakers and researchers. It provides a crucial foundation for developing strategies that promote climate justice and foster a more equitable and sustainable future.

Considering social and fairness implications of climate action is critical to avoid widening inequalities and public opposition. The just transitions (JT) and sustainable welfare/eco‐social policy (SW/ESP) literatures both address social and fairness issues related to climate action. However, they have developed largely separately from each other and are not well integrated, limiting the capacity to holistically consider social and fairness issues in climate action. To examine differences and synergies between these two bodies of literature, this paper compares their stances on key themes of capitalism and economic growth, work and welfare, and global justice. While both of these literatures are internally diverse, JT publications tend to focus on justice implications for workers in high carbon sectors, and SW/ESP research examines how welfare systems can support wellbeing for all within planetary boundaries. The JT literature would benefit from a more systematic consideration of post‐capitalist and post‐growth debates, which are more prevalent in the SW/ESP literature, including options for decoupling welfare from work and from economic growth. The JT literature increasingly discusses issues on global justice and decolonization, but the SW/ESP literature has so far largely failed to examine these themes, a gap that it should address. Overall, we argue that each of the literatures can integrate aspects from the other to form a more holistic and transformative approach for addressing social and fairness issues in climate policy.

Moving beyond technical performance, the study conceptualizes predictive AI as a dynamic policy instrument that reshapes administrative routines, authority, and accountability. Drawing on Scott's institutional theory, Salamon's policy‐instrument framework, and Ziewitz's algorithmic governance model, it employs a mixed‐methods design combining surveys and semi‐structured interviews with frontline officials. The findings reveal three insights. First, predictive AI influences decision‐making by offering real‐time quantitative justification, especially in field‐level operations. Second, successful institutionalization depends on the alignment of regulatory (e.g., SOPs), normative (e.g., leadership support), and cognitive (e.g., trust) pillars. Third, organizational context—such as agency size and leadership orientation—mediates how these factors interact. Despite high technical accuracy, institutionalization remains uneven due to unclear accountability and weak integration mechanisms. The study identifies a structural tension between AI‐driven efficiency and traditional accountability norms. Theoretically, it bridges policy‐instrument theory and algorithmic governance within an institutional framework. Practically, it proposes design principles for responsible AI implementation in government.

This article analyzes data from a follow‐up survey of the VAA Voteswiper during the 2025 German federal election campaign to assess whether VAA results align with users' prior voting intentions and how they correlate with subsequent short‐term voting intentions. We find that users intending to vote for fringe parties are most likely to receive a VAA match consistent with their initial preferences. In contrast, those initially favoring more centrist parties are less likely to receive a match with their preferred party and more often match with populist or fringe parties—particularly the far‐right Alternative for Germany. Moreover, we identify substantial differences across social groups in both the alignment between VAA results and prior preferences and the extent to which VAA results influence intended short‐term vote choices. These findings suggest that VAAs may disproportionately benefit populist parties, especially on the radical right, potentially shifting user preferences and challenging the widely held view of VAAs as neutral tools of political education.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.70028", "doi": "10.1002/poi3.70028", "journal_full": "Policy and Internet", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008109667714038649}, {"title": "From Global to Local: Building Internet Policy(ies) in a National Digital Agenda", "authors": "Carolina Aguerre, Matías Dodel, Adrián Rosso", "abstract": "This study examines the development and consolidation of Uruguay's national digital agenda as a policy instrument and the normative preferences underlying this choice.

This emphasizes the need for incentive programs that consider the responsibilities and limitations of all actors along the food supply chain.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68988-y", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68988-y", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019419034429490445}, {"title": "Harnessing the power of virtual reality technology to enhance public health genomics skills in Africa", "authors": "Harris Onywera, Collins Kipngetich Tanui, Alisen Ayitewala, Alex N.

H. Morgan, Robin Watson, Hillary L. Lenfesty, Charlotte O. Brand", "abstract": "Human hunter-gatherer groups were commonly thought to be broadly egalitarian, with increasingly formal hierarchical social structures hypothesized to spread following the introduction of agriculture. However, this view is being challenged by mounting evidence for social hierarchies in several foraging populations. Nonetheless, the processes by which such hierarchies emerge, and whether human hierarchies are homologous with non-human systems of dominance, remains unclear. Here we examine the role of prestige, the tendency to freely confer status and influence on skilled or esteemed individuals and a proposed component of human-unique cultural psychology, in generating unequal patterns of social influence. Through a combination of cultural evolutionary modelling, human experimentation, and evolutionary simulations, we find that human prestige psychology generates highly unequal influence hierarchies, and that the “prestige sensitivity” we measure empirically in human participants closely matches the predictions of our evolutionary simulations, suggesting it is an evolved psychological adaptation. Nonetheless, unlike non-human dominance hierarchies, the processes involved are non-coercive, being driven by individuals freely seeking high quality information. We thus conclude that social hierarchies plausibly have a deep evolutionary history in our lineage, with prestige enabling hierarchies to be mutually beneficial as opposed to coercive.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68410-7", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68410-7", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016202950324776033}, {"title": "Social connections are differentially related to subjective age and physiological age acceleration amongst older adults", "authors": "Daisy Fancourt, Andrew Steptoe, Mikaela Bloomberg", "abstract": "Human social connections are complex ecosystems formed of structural, functional and quality components. Weak social connections are associated with adverse age-related health outcomes, but we know little about the ageing-related processes underlying this. Using data from 7047 adults aged 50+ in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we explore associations between diverse aspects of social connections and both older subjective age and accelerated physiological age using a validated physiological ageing combining cardiovascular, respiratory, haematologic and metabolic indicators. Doubly robust estimations using inverse-probability-weighted regression adjustment estimators show that living alone, low social integration and low social support are risk factors for physiological age acceleration. However, weak social connections did not have a statistically significant association with older subjective age. Analyses are robust to multiple sensitivity analyses and maintained four years later. We propose the hypothesis that accelerated physiological ageing may be a mechanism underpinning the relationship between weak social connections and age-related morbitidy and mortality.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68977-1", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68977-1", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010633433367143952}, {"title": "Transition to bio-based plastic packaging reveals complex climate–biodiversity trade-offs", "authors": "Bilal Erradhouani, Veronique Coma, Guido Sonnemann, Philippe Loubet", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-69016-9", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-69016-9", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.031174533231883572}, {"title": "Printed origami thermoelectric generator achieves &gt; 20 Wm−² from low-grade heat via material and process design", "authors": "Nan Luo, Zirui Wang, Ajay Kumar Verma, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Leonard Franke, Jiayi Liu, Alexei Nefedov, Marc Schneider, Holger Geßwein, Erich Müller, Kirsten Drüppel, Tobias Weingaertner, Yolita M.

Little is known about whether gender shapes how political elites evaluate potential coalition allies. I theorize that politicians prefer women as coalition partners for their perceived qualities, such as consensus building, trustworthiness, and governance abilities, making them a less threatening option for politicians’ aspirations. Conducting an original conjoint experiment with 979 Spanish mayors, I find that mayors, especially those on the center and left, prefer to form coalition governments with parties led by women. The analysis of the mechanisms suggests that women leaders are perceived as easier to communicate and more competent to govern. These findings suggest that gendered perceptions and stereotypes may play a role in elite decision-making and shaping coalition preferences.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10077", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10077", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0077062433531214225}, {"title": "Beyond the mean: how thinking about the distribution of public opinions reduces politicians’ perceptual errors", "authors": "Nicholas Dias, Jack Lucas, Lior Sheffer", "abstract": "Elected politicians regularly over-estimate the conservatism of their constituents’ preferences. While these findings have concerning implications for democratic representation, the magnitude and sources of so-called “conservative over-estimation” are poorly understood. We show that a novel approach to measuring politicians’ perceptions—which asks politicians to draw the distribution of their constituents’ preferences, rather than provide a point estimate—clarifies the magnitude and causes of conservative over-estimation. While the vast majority of politicians exhibit a conservative bias, our “perceived-distribution” task cuts the size of this bias in half. Moreover, psychological projection counterbalances conservative over-estimation among left-wing politicians but reinforces it among right-wing politicians. Our results raise questions about existing accounts of elite misperceptions and help to identify the psychological causes of conservative over-estimation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10069", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10069", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005751082074380909}, {"title": "When restrictive economic zoning leads to racial segregation", "authors": "Jessica Trounstine", "abstract": "Scholars have shown that restrictive zoning is correlated with racial segregation, but we lack an understanding of why this occurs.

Using an agent-based model, I find that restrictive zoning produces racial segregation, but only when residents have homophilic preferences and unequal wealth. Then using a novel dataset of parcel-level zoning codes, I show neighborhoods that are restrictively zoned have higher home values, are less diverse, wealthier, and have more homeowners. Finally, I show that cities vary in the degree to which zoning regulations are geographically clustered.

However, with this growth in digital connection, we have also become connected with digital entities that run them (social media). Borrowing from the concept of interpersonal responsiveness, researchers have found that users perceive their algorithm to be responsive to their needs and sensitive to their identity have a greater sense of well-being online and media enjoyment. However, the mechanisms for which these connect with one another (responsiveness predicting subjective well-being) remain to be disentangled. Guided by self-determination theory, this study examines whether autonomy, competence, and relatedness satisfaction through TikTok use mediate the associations between perceived algorithm responsiveness and insensitivity and satisfaction with life. With an online survey ( N = 385), our study found that greater responsiveness is associated with greater life satisfaction mediated through greater relatedness satisfaction. However, greater competence satisfaction was associated with lower life satisfaction.

I argue that WoC operates both as a descriptor and an identity. As a descriptor, it resembles a panethnic label for nonwhite women. When adopted as an identity—the focus of this study—it may carry deeper significance connected to its progressive roots. Scholars often categorize all racially diverse women as WoC based on presumed experiences of oppression. However, this assumption overlooks variation in race-gendered discrimination shaped by factors such as appearance and class. Women who are perceived as white or those with lighter skin tones, for example, may not experience racialization in the same ways as other nonwhite women. Given the label’s association with liberal political views and its emphasis on “color,” some women may choose not to adopt it or may be uncertain about their inclusion. Using 2020 CMPS data, this study builds on WoC scholarship by incorporating Asian women and compares their experiences and attitudes to those of Latina and Black women. Results show that the majority of Asian women identify as a WoC and report high levels of WoC-linked fate. Among Asian women, personal experiences with discrimination and empathy toward other marginalized groups are especially important in WoC identity formation. WoC-linked fate also demonstrates political relevance across all three groups, showing a positive relationship with support for undocumented immigrants and the #MeToo movement.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10051", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10051", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08601817159025094}, {"title": "Do News Media Want to Disentangle from Platforms?", "authors": "Rasmus Kleis Nielsen", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2026.2623275", "doi": "10.1080/21670811.2026.2623275", "journal_full": "Digital Journalism", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007872950710909765}, {"title": "“When they return home they do nothing for half a year”: opposing remittances and articulations of Romanian migrant labour in agriculture", "authors": "Remus Gabriel Anghel, Lucian Vesalon", "abstract": "Food security is becoming increasingly problematised, as demonstrated by the Covid-19 pandemic and the ensuing lockdown, or by the crisis in the global grain markets induced by the war in Ukraine. How out-migration and return change agriculture in different countries of origin, including Eastern Europe, is less understood in connection to such crises. In this paper we look at the ways in which agriculture and its labour regime change under the impact of international migration in two geographical areas in Romania, the Transylvanian Highlands and Banat. We analyse how two types of actors return to Romanian agriculture and how they occupy different labour positions: small-scale entrepreneurs and seasonal workers. Unlike much research on migration and development depicting migrants as agents of positive change, we consider social remittances as contested. We advance the notion of “opposing remittances” to account for how migrants differently reflect on their migration experiences and how class-based relations, marginalisation and racial inequalities affect social remittances related to labour. Ultimately, this paper reveals how inequalities are entangled in return migration in agriculture, and how contingent migration experiences contribute to the variegation of social remittances.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-026-00529-4", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-026-00529-4", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9732166353829854}, {"title": "Framing child refugee deaths across water borders: media narratives of Alan Kurdi and Valeria Martínez-Ramírez in Turkey and Mexico", "authors": "Eduardo González", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-026-00527-6", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-026-00527-6", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9795205101903259}, {"title": "The enduring migration-development dilemma: skills mobility partnerships and the challenge of conflicting capabilities", "authors": "Takeshi Miyai", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-026-00525-8", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-026-00525-8", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9683515526181982}, {"title": "Force of Attraction and Partner Availability in the U.S. Marriage Market: A Two-Sided Matching Model", "authors": "Yuan Cheng, John Dagsvik, Xuehui Han, Zhiyang Jia", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.15195/v13.a8", "doi": "10.15195/v13.a8", "journal_full": "Sociological Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.13374329313695443}, {"title": "School discipline disparities increase when neighborhood Black population changes", "authors": "Jennifer Candipan, Chantal A.

This study combines school zone shapefiles with census and Civil Rights Database data to explore whether neighborhood racial change in Black populations predicts changes in Black-white school suspension disparities from 2010 to 2018. We find that racial disparities in suspensions increased, particularly in neighborhoods experiencing substantial shifts in Black populations. These increases were especially pronounced in suburban and rural areas with shifting Black populations and all predominantly White neighborhoods. Although school discipline reforms aimed to reduce racial disparities, they only declined in certain types of neighborhoods, most notably in urban areas.

Here, we resolve this paradox by shifting from trait-level to state-level analysis. Leveraging a microtask design to measure daily fluctuations in cognitive function, goal setting and goal progress, mood, sleep, and motivation over a 12-week intensive longitudinal study of university students ( N = 184, time points = 9248), we show that within-person upswings in domain-general cognitive processing precision precede and predict same-day self-reported goal setting and achievement across both academic and nonacademic domains, even controlling for other factors. A one-standard-deviation change in cognitive precision had an effect statistically equivalent to ~40 min of work, with similar or larger predictive effects compared to fluctuations in mood/motivation and no moderation by trait-level self-control or conscientiousness.

Here we investigate the extent to which SSNs affect women’s economic achievements and agency through a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials implemented in low- and middle-income countries. We searched six databases utilizing search strings in English, French and Spanish through December 2024. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using an adapted version of the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Our sample includes 1,307 effect sizes from 93 studies, representing 218,828 women across 45 low- and middle-income countries. Using robust variance estimation meta-analysis, we show significant overall pooled effects (Hedges’ g = 0.107, P &lt; 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.085–0.129), driven by increases in economic achievements (productive work, savings, assets and expenditures) and agency (voice, autonomy and decision-making). We find significant treatment effects for unconditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.128, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.097 to 0.159), social care services (Hedges’ g = 0.122, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.174), asset transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.115, P &lt; 0.001, 95% CI 0.071 to 0.160) and public work programmes (Hedges’ g = 0.127, P = 0.031, 95% CI 0.015 to 0.239). We find comparatively smaller effects for conditional cash transfers (Hedges’ g = 0.059, P = 0.019, 95% CI 0.011 to 0.108) and found no evidence of effects for in-kind transfers.

In this research, we propose a novel methodology framework for estimating building energy efficiency using only external and widely existing data. We have designed and trained an end-to-end multi-channel deep learning model utilizing high-resolution thermal infrared and optical remotely sensed images, street view images, socio-economic indicators, and building morphological data. Validated in Glasgow and Edinburgh, the model achieved F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.69. Further analyses surprisingly suggest that more deprived neighborhoods tend to have better building energy efficiency.

However, how these risks propagate, cluster or diverge across interconnected systems is unclear. To bridge this gap, this study constructs a multi-tiered risk-weighted network to disentangle interactions and reveal risk communities. UK-wide flood events from 2003 to 2023 were simulated using CaMa-Flood. Using these simulations, a flood-specific risk resistance surface, incorporating device, spatial, and external disturbance dimensions, was used to construct an adjacency graph for 29,697 EV charging points, yielding a risk-weighted network with 192,862,650 annual edges. This integrated framework enables a unified examination of flood-driven interaction pathways across scales. We find: (1) Flood risk propagation is driven respectively by spatial amplification (63.8%) at the node level, hybrid natural–built coupling (45.3%, 49.6%) at the buffer scale, and impact-driven dynamics (49.0%, 23.6%, 27.0%) at the disturbance layer, representing the relative contributions of entropy-weighted factor groups that form each resistance layer; (2) Risk propagation is governed not by group size, but by the interplay among structural coherence, spatial buffering, and fragmentation constraints across scales; and (3) Risk propagation emerges in fragmented, outward-oriented communities, where spatial geographical interplay, rather than path length, shapes intergroup cascades. These findings highlight multi-scale structural mechanisms driving flood-induced cascade behaviour.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-026-00344-x", "doi": "10.1038/s42949-026-00344-x", "journal_full": "npj Urban Sustainability", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01402080102817238}, {"title": "Viral Market Formation: Symbolic Consumption, Platform Virality, and the Labubu Phenomenon", "authors": "Pahul Sachdeva", "abstract": "This paper examines how contemporary consumer trends emerge, accelerate, and consolidate market value through processes of symbolic consumption and platform-mediated virality.

Drawing on literature from consumer behavior, cultural sociology, and attention economics, the analysis situates Labubu not as an isolated trend but as an illustrative example of broader dynamics shaping contemporary markets.

As these policies have expanded in scope, duration and objectives, however, the terminology used to describe them has evolved unevenly across countries, international organisations, databases and academic research. This Policy Brief argues that terminology is not merely a semantic or technical issue, but a core element of governance and knowledge production. The concepts used to name, classify and aggregate parenting leave entitlements shape how policies are designed, monitored, evaluated and compared. Inconsistent terminology weakens cross-national comparability, obscures policy effects and undermines evidence-based policymaking. Drawing on a comprehensive review of international regulations, comparative databases, national terminologies and academic research, the brief demonstrates that traditional distinctions between maternity, paternity and parental leave no longer adequately capture the diversity and complexity of contemporary leave systems. While diversity in national terminology is both inevitable and normatively meaningful, the absence of a harmonised comparative framework has become a major obstacle to effective monitoring, policy learning and research synthesis. The brief concludes that harmonisation of terminology at national level is neither feasible nor desirable, but that harmonised terminology for comparative and monitoring purposes is essential.

Using Firth’s logistic regression with cluster bootstrap, we assessed differences in technique use for interactions involving civilians showing intoxicated, incomprehensible, or heightened emotional behavior, compared to interactions with civilians not exhibiting these behaviors. Findings – Officers employed the full range of de-escalation techniques, most frequently utilizing communication strategies. The use of specific techniques varied with the civilians’ emotional and behavioral states. For 22 de-escalation techniques, the odds that officers use them proved to be either significantly higher or lower in the investigated types of interactions. Sixteen techniques were specific for one type of interaction (e.g., civilian showing incomprehensible behavior), while six were significant for more than one type of interaction. Most differences were observed in interactions with civilians exhibiting heightened emotional behavior, where, for example, the odds of officers remaining calm were higher compared to interactions with civilians not showing such behaviors.

This study aimed to assess how students involved in a co-creation process (i.e. a student citizens’ assembly) conceptualise and prioritise solutions to improve students’ access to healthier, more climate-friendly diets. Methods: This participatory research took place at a French university (Sorbonne Paris Nord) located in socioeconomically disadvantaged suburbs of Paris. A student citizens’ assembly was conducted with the aim to co-create concrete proposals that would enhance students’ access to sustainable diets and physical activity. The assembly involved 27 students randomly selected among a pool of volunteers. Over three days in November 2024, students received awareness-raising and training, deliberated among themselves then with institutional and local stakeholders, and formulated proposals. For each proposal, students were asked to rate anonymously their approval on a 10-point scale. Proposals related to diet (i.e. not physical activity) were analysed a posteriori using two complementary frameworks: the DONE framework classifying determinants of diet (individual, interpersonal, environmental /policy) and the FAO dimensions of sustainable diets (health, ecological, socioeconomic, cultural). Results: Overall, 31 proposals were formulated, of which 77% targeted environmental and policy determinants of diet (e.g. institutional regulations, university policies, food assistance solutions, improved food affordability and availability, food labelling). Other proposals referred to individual (19%) and interpersonal determinants (3%). In addition, 39%, 29%, 23% and 10% proposals addressed the health, socio-economic, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively. Mean approval ratings (SD) for each proposal ranged from 6.7 (4.0) to 9.7 (0.9), with a mean (SD) value for all proposals of 8.6 (0.7). Proposals addressing the socio-economic dimension received the highest approval ratings (mean [SD] 9.0 [0.6], vs 8.4 [0.6], 8.4 [0.8] and 7.9 [0.4] for the health, ecological and cultural dimensions, respectively). Conclusion: The predominance of environmental and policy measures targeting economic access to food highlights the importance of co-creation and its value to align interventions with participants’ needs and expectations.

Loss aversion implements adaptive precision-weighting of prediction errors, allocating greater computational resources to negative deviations that threaten survival. Reference dependence implements efficient predictive coding, transmitting only surprising deviations from expectations. Probability weighting reflects optimal precision allocation across the probability range when maintaining full Bayesian representations would exceed metabolic budgets. This framework is supported by converging evidence: neuroimaging studies show unified value coding with asymmetric precision for losses; pharmacological manipulations reveal dissociable neurotransmitter systems for value encoding versus loss sensitivity; and metabolic manipulations including hypoxia, glucose depletion, and circadian mismatch modulate prospect theory parameters in predicted directions. Developmental evidence shows that children display probability weighting patterns opposite to adults, with gradual transformation through experience pointing at calibration rather than to genetic determination.

A mathematical model", "authors": "Benoît de Courson, Willem Frankenhuis, Daniel Nettle", "abstract": "People in situations of poverty tend to heavily discount the future. Despite robust evidence, the theoretical literature lacks satisfying models to explain why. Existing theories often invoke urgent needs to explain impatience, this intuition is not sufficient: in persistent poverty, one may need resources tomorrow as much as today. We show that previous models assume that poverty is temporary and improvement is expected, and predict discounting only under this condition, which is rarely realistic. Here, we present the first model showing that time discounting can be rational in persistent poverty. We propose a two-period model in which basic needs are captured by a 'desperation threshold' -- a critical resource level above which agents aim to stay. In four stylized scenarios, we show analytically that agents discount the future near the threshold and are patient at intermediate resource levels. In line with the empirical record, time discounting increases on both sides of the threshold, while risk taking is polarized -- higher below the threshold, lower above. Unlike existing accounts, our explanation does not rely on assuming a future improvement in financial situation. Rather, it predicts a U-shaped effect of future expectations, with greater time discounting if the future will be either much better or much worse than the present, which can reconcile economic theory with ethnographic findings.

The primary evidentiary window spans November 2023 through May 2025, with documentation and analysis concentrated across 2024–2025. The case is reported from the perspective of the primary target and applies a structured analytic approach that distinguishes (a) observable digital behaviors (e.g., timestamps, posts, interactions, and platform activity) from (b) interpretive analysis grounded in repeated patterns, timing relationships, symbolic consistency, and escalation dynamics observable across time and platforms. The dataset is organized as a structured case file consisting of an executive summary, preface, and methodology section outlining documentation procedures and interpretive criteria; contextual background establishing relevant relational and digital history; a master timeline organized around correlated activity and post-response timing relationships; and appendices addressing recurrent tactic clusters, including sexual objectification, identity manipulation, covert account proliferation, fantasy-based framing, and probability-based reasoning relevant to assessments of intentionality. All identifying details—including names, locations, venues, and searchable lyrical content—have been anonymized or paraphrased to preserve privacy while retaining evidentiary and analytic integrity.

Drawing on Social Cognitive Theory, it tests entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE) as a mediator and perceived environmental hardship as a moderator. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative cross-sectional survey was conducted with 270 working-age adults across three regions of South Sudan (Juba/Central Equatoria, Upper Nile and Western Bahr el Ghazal) between July and October 2025 using paper-based and online questionnaires. Hypotheses were tested using hierarchical regression and PROCESS-based mediation (Model 4) and moderation (Model 1) with 5,000 bootstrap resamples. Findings: PMST is positively associated with EI. ESE mediates this relationship (indirect-only): the bootstrapped indirect effect is significant and the PMST→EI direct effect becomes non-significant when ESE is included. Perceived environmental hardship weakens the positive PMST–EI relationship. Resilience is positively related to EI but does not moderate the focal relationship. Research limitations/implications: The cross-sectional design limits causal inference and self-reports may introduce common method bias. Future research should use longitudinal and comparative designs and examine behavioral outcomes (e.g., business start-up). Practical implications: Reintegration and entrepreneurship programs should combine skills-recognition and ESE-building (e.g., mastery-based training and mentoring) with ecosystem interventions that reduce contextual constraints. Social implications: Supporting entrepreneurship among individuals with military experience may contribute to livelihood recovery, inclusion and reintegration in fragile settings.

In this wide-ranging study, Aleksandar Korolija develops the original concept of the imperial ideological apparatus—a framework that connects the structures of global finance, political power, and transnational institutions such as NATO, the IMF, and NGOs with the formation of contemporary ideological systems. Combining philosophical precision with historical analysis, the book explores how class domination is maintained not only through economic coercion but through the cultural and ideological mechanisms of the global order. Drawing on Marx, Gramsci, and Althusser—while critically engaging with other critical authors—Korolija demonstrates how the transition from the nation-state to the imperial phase of capitalism transforms the function of ideology itself.

However, the integration of these principles into teaching—particularly assessment—has lagged behind. While many open educational resources (OERs) have been developed to support the teaching of open science, fewer efforts have focused on embedding open science into how students are assessed. This tutorial addresses that gap by offering a series of practical, scalable strategies for integrating open and reproducible science into psychology education through assessment. We argue that to normalise open science, students must not only learn about its principles but be assessed on their understanding and application of them. Drawing on examples from our undergraduate and postgraduate programmes and the wider literature, we outline a range of assessment strategies aligned with curriculum standards and pedagogical evidence. These include incorporating pre-registration and registered reports, evaluating reproducibility through code and data submission, engaging students in peer review and code review, and integrating open science concepts into essays, multiple-choice exams, and final dissertations. We highlight that even small changes at the course level can promote open science, and that educators should approach implementation flexibly, recognising it as a continuum rather than a binary shift. Importantly, we also stress the need to avoid framing open science as overly technical or inaccessible, which may discourage student engagement. By embedding open and reproducible practices into assessment design, educators can support the development of critical, ethical, and transparent future scientists.

Regarding contractual relations, we differentiate between formal, informal, and platform-mediated creative labour. In forms of automation, we identify four dominant uses: automation as replacement, automation as augmentation, human-extended automation, and control.

As such, we attempt to overcome the dichotomic opposition between agency and control that characterises much of the research that examines the relationship between digital technologies and creative labour. Instead, we acknowledge that agency is distributed between practices, artifacts and social structures, and that this distribution is not evenly negotiated.

Background: Total fertility rates in Finland have declined sharply since 2010, reaching lowest-low levels in recent years. This study complements previous, mostly register-based, research by focusing on young Finns’ fertility intentions and their self-reported rationales. Method: We analyzed survey responses from 3,803 young Finns (aged 20–29) collected in 2021–2022, who evaluated how 39 rationales influenced their fertility intentions, including postponement, not desiring (additional) children, or uncertainty. Exploratory factor analysis was used to group the rationales, and latent profile analysis identified distinct groups of individuals with similar rationales. Multinomial logit models were then estimated to examine the associations between these profiles and fertility intentions. Results: We identified five latent profiles differing in their constellations of personal and partnership concerns, autonomy concerns, global concerns, and career-related concerns. Postponing childbearing was typical of the groups with moderate concerns over personal autonomy and career, who could also have experienced personal and partnership difficulties. Individuals who intended to forgo childbearing entirely prioritized personal autonomy and global concerns.

This enduring status is striking because Weber’s argument rests primarily on theological writings rather than on direct engagement with the (historical) occupational world. While recent economic history has produced a substantial body of empirical tests and refinements of Weber’s thesis, far less attention has been paid to his core claim that theological concepts helped shape distinctive work-oriented subjectivities. This article addresses that gap by examining art manuals produced for and by artisans during the Reformation era, with a particular focus on Nuremberg. By situating these manuals in their historical contexts, it demonstrates that their authors explicitly related their understandings of work to theological ideas, though in ways that depart from standard Lutheran assumptions. The manuals draw not only on Protestant sources but also on humanist traditions.

Our central proposition is that the diffusion of cohabitation among immigrants is more pronounced in countries where the practice is common and socially accepted among the native population. We analysed pooled data from the European Social Survey (ESS; 2002–2023), encompassing 66,017 respondents across 32 countries. Our findings provide evidence of an adaptation pattern: descendants of immigrants are significantly more likely to have ever cohabited than the first generation. Crucially, this generational difference does not vary systematically according to the prevalence of cohabitation among natives. The cohabitation context nonetheless significantly increases the likelihood of ever having cohabited, outweighing the influence of economic factors such as income inequality (Gini index).

Our findings indicate an intricate interplay of genetic endowments, income and education of the parents, (re-)application behavior, and early adulthood income and occupational status. Individuals with a higher EDU-PGS were more likely to reapply after rejection, suggesting a genetic component in persistence in educational goals and application behaviors beyond family background. Mental illness did not have an effect over and above other included indicators on stop applying, and there was no evidence for the presence of gene-environment interactions.

This study adopts a systematised conceptual literature review design, employing a structured search and thematic synthesis to develop an integrative conceptual framework that positions university entrepreneurial ecosystems as a dynamic interplay between internal (e.g. university leadership, faculty) and external (e.g. government, venture capitalists) stakeholders. The framework identifies knowledge spillover and transfer as key mediating processes, and highlights intellectual property frameworks and mechanisms (e.g. university IP policy, legal system) as a critical moderator that can either enable or constrain academic entrepreneurship, and subsequently spin-off formation. Applying this lens to New Zealand, a paradoxical situation was uncovered: while home to a recognised “emerging world leading” university entrepreneurial ecosystem, there is a significant paucity of recent, system-wide academic research. Key gaps are identified, including the need for longitudinal data on spin-offs performances, and a deeper understanding of internal ecosystem dynamics like the critical imperative to integrate Mātauranga Māori (Māori traditional knowledge) into commercialisation pathways.

We argue that institutionalization and institutional change are best understood by focusing on actors with the requisite knowledge and motivation to keep institutional patterns going, fix them when they go awry, or transform them when required, here called functionaries. The distributional approach allows us to distinguish between two main types of institutional change often conflated in the literature: Content-based and formal change. Content-based change, the one most often discussed, involves the importation, recombination, or expansion of specific patterns of activity. In contrast, formal change, often neglected in the literature, refers to shifts in the distribution of knowledge and activity within an institution, leading to dynamics of centralization and decentralization of institutional patterns. In this way, the distributional approach highlights the role of functionaries in both institutional stability and change, providing a micro-level perspective on institutional dynamics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p48ft_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/p48ft_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005297709247988225}, {"title": "The Constructed Indicator: A Practitioner’s Perspective on Interpreting QS Citations per Faculty", "authors": "Junjie Shen", "abstract": "This Letter examines how the design of the QS Citations per Faculty (CPF) indicator shapes institutional interpretation and use, from a practitioner perspective.

This study examines partisan polarization on Ukraine aid between Democratic and Republican elites as reflected in U.S. news media from March 2022 to December 2024, leveraging party brand theory and foreign policy polarization literature to explain when and how Democrats and Republicans consolidated distinct positions on a novel foreign policy issue. Analyzing 37,312 sentences from 23,630 news articles, we employ a dual-pipeline methodology combining LLM-based ideological scoring across four dimensions with BERT-based masked vocabulary extraction. Results reveal significant polarization growth, driven asymmetrically by Republican movement toward opposition while Democrats maintained stable pro-aid positioning. Resource allocation framing, such that Ukraine aid competes with domestic resources, contributed most strongly to the general polarization of supplying further aid to Ukraine, accounting for over 60% of explained variance. PELT identified October 2022 as the first major departure from bipartisan consensus, with polarization of the subsequent segments moving with electoral cycles and leadership transitions. Critically, as polarization increased, so did the clarity of party brands to voters: both parties’ messaging became more internally coherent, enabling clearer partisan differentiation. Vocabulary extraction revealed early crystallization of partisan linguistic patterns, with Democrats emphasizing language of provision (“promised,” “signed”) and Republicans emphasizing language of obstruction (“block,” “killed”).

Second, the autonomous origins of developmentalism in Asian financial scripts are discussed which markedly differ from (neo)liberal conceptions of finance. Third, and moving beyond the neoliberal-developmental dichotomy, the chapter conducts a comparative analysis of the five largest Asian financial systems: China, Korea, India, Japan, and Singapore. In doing so, the chapter identifies significant variations of how Asian finance relates to the liberal script, ranging between accommodation, resistance, and contestation. While maintaining some developmental characteristics, Japan and Singapore largely accommodate the liberal script. In contrast, we can observe resistance to conform with the liberal script in Korea and India where developmental characteristics maintain a prominent role and steps are taken to enable a controlled co-existence. Finally, only China truly contests the liberal script, both through the intensity and international reach of its developmental characteristics but most importantly through other actors’ reaction towards it. The chapter thus illustrates that while there are significant differences between (more) developmental Asian and (more) neoliberal Western financial systems, the rise of Asia represents only a partial contestation of the neoliberal financial script, which cannot, however, be separated from broader geopolitical constellations that challenge the liberal script.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g8tjc_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/g8tjc_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.018450071499142462}, {"title": "Ubiquitous Audiency: Recorded Music and Attention in Everyday Public-space Encounters in China", "authors": "Samuel Horlor", "abstract": "This article puts forward the idea of ubiquitous audiency to help explain the fleeting and fluid ways in which ostensibly peripheral actors, such as passers-by, help perform musical situations in city streets and similar situations of everyday public-space life.

We aim to characterize families with four or more children (largest-large families) and to identify the socio-demographic factors that distinguish them from families with one or two children (small families) which represent the prevailing model. To do this, we apply multivariate logistic models to microdata from the 2011 Italian Population and Housing Census. This is the last Census conducted in Italy on universal population basis. Sample surveys are usually not large enough to enable in-depth analyses of the processes underlying the formation of this type of families. The census source also allows analyses to be conducted separately for the native and non-native populations. Results suggest a socio-economic polarization of largest-large families and a negative association with women’s education among both native and non-native populations.

We further test whether green space moderates the relationship between disadvantage and youth health. Census-tract analyses show that neighborhood disadvantage is strongly correlated with higher prevalence of obesity, asthma, and poor mental health among youth. Disadvantaged neighborhoods had significantly less park space and tree canopy cover, and areas with limited green space showed higher risks for all three health concerns. Greater tree canopy was specifically associated with reduced obesity risk. Crucially, interaction analyses revealed that higher proportions of park space substantially weakened the negative effects of disadvantage across all health outcomes.

At the same time, recovery residences and diversion courts are expanding without a clear framework for institutional design. This paper develops a mechanism-design model of harm-reduction policy at the interface of criminal justice and community treatment. A public funder chooses a funding regime and certification rules, diversion judges set the stringency of supervision and treatment conditions, recovery residence providers decide whether to operate abstinence-only or MOUD-inclusive housing, and high-risk individuals choose whether to comply or relapse. The model yields a punitive equilibrium, supported by abstinence-only funding and strict conditions, and a harm-reduction equilibrium under MOUD-inclusive funding and flexible conditions. Using effect sizes from Rhode Island’s statewide corrections MOUD program, Massachusetts’ jail-based MOUD pilots, and recent recovery housing evaluations, we show that the harm-reduction equilibrium is Pareto-superior for funders, judges, providers, and high-severity residents, yet the punitive equilibrium can remain risk-dominant because of political and informational frictions. We then embed the game in a computational social choice framework: stakeholders hold multi-dimensional preferences over policy bundles—combinations of funding rules, certification standards, diversion guidelines, and overdose prevention interventions such as supervised consumption sites—and social choice is constrained by justice-based requirements that rule out policies generating avoidable lethal risk or systematic exclusion of MOUD patients from housing and treatment. The analysis characterizes which harm-reduction mechanisms are implementable as equilibrium outcomes of the institutional game while respecting these constrained social preferences, and it identifies simple instruments—MOUD-inclusive funding commitments, performance-based transparency, and structured diversion defaults—that can move jurisdictions from punitive to harm-reduction equilibria within existing legal constraints.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wrkj3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/wrkj3_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006098722405158186}, {"title": "Monitor Digitale Arbeitsgesellschaft – Kurzbericht der zweiten Befragungswelle.

However, the term is not well defined and often applied to cases more accurately described as protected areas with low management effectiveness. This inconsistency is problematic because areas where management interventions are entirely absent (true paper parks) fundamentally differ in conceptualisation, monitoring, and required solutions from those where management is insufficient or poorly executed (ineffective management). To address this, here we propose a new paper park definition as “a site that has been legally or otherwise designated as a protected area, but where management interventions have been absent for at least 5 years”. We present a decision tree to identify paper parks and discuss how they differ from other types of conservation areas.

The study’s objectives were to examine how climate change contributes to these conflicts, identify key conflict drivers, and propose strategies to mitigate their impacts.

The findings reveal that environmental degradation acts as a conflict catalyst only where weak governance and social exclusion prevail. Statistics from the region indicate that mean annual temperatures have increased significantly since the 1960s, while rainfall in the Sahel has become increasingly erratic, leading to a 40% loss of livestock in past extreme drought cycles and displacing hundreds of thousands in central Mali. Yet, communities that maintain inclusive local mediation structures experience fewer violent clashes.

This paper conceptualizes miseconomics as the practice of conducting economic activity that generates cumulative social harm through normalized societal losses, and misaligned incentives that erode moral responsibility while remaining internally consistent within an institutional framework. Drawing on classical moral philosophy, normative economic critiques, and cases from governance failures across multiple political systems, the study analyses moral entropy to describe a pattern of progressive institutional disorder. Governmental failure is examined through the conceptual framework of Lazeez Fair governance, wherein symbolic, performative, and indulgent interventions substitute substantive reform, allowing dysfunction to persist despite visible action. The paper further illustrates these dynamics though global patterns of corruption, institutional capture, and the selected cases of proxy warfare, showing patterns through which costs appear externalized onto vulnerable populations while benefits accrue narrowly. It concludes that without a structural realignment of incentives and a reintegration of moral responsibility into mainstream economic thought and governance- stability, sustainability, and development- risk remaining structurally unattainable.

While the previous work proposed a model where imbalances are perpetuated through asset preference and capital diffusion, this study extends the framework into a model where \"effective asset potential\"—defined as the asset level divided by the rate of return on assets—acts as the driving force behind capital flows. It demonstrates a mechanism in which the capital efficiency of each nation significantly determines its economic trajectory. Through observations using multilateral data, this paper reveals that individual economies exist under a tension between \"subjective equilibrium,\" aimed at utility maximization, and the \"pressure of entropy increase\" inherent in asset dynamics. Consequently, the global economy has polarized into \"self-organizing economies\" that concentrate and accumulate capital, and \"diffusive economies\" that primarily disperse and dissipate capital. This paper presents a novel perspective that views the global economy as a \"dissipative structure\" maintained through the interdependence of these distinct phases. Based on this analysis, the paper argues that for an economic system to remain sustainable, it is essential to involve maintaining the gradient of asset potential within the system by promoting innovation and eliminating \"stagnation\" through redistribution policies. Ultimately, this paper proposes that what economics terms \"equilibrium\" is equivalent to \"thermal death\" in physics; therefore, the goal of economics should be the avoidance rather than the realization of such a state, making the perspective of \"entropy management\" indispensable.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zah6e_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zah6e_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009577910004711643}, {"title": "Selective Inclusion and Colonial Institutions: Rethinking the Settler–Extractive Distinction in Long-Run Development⋆", "authors": "Don Sanjeewa Alwis", "abstract": "The institutional approach to development typically classifies colonial institutions as inclusive or extractive.

To operationalize this idea, I construct a Partial Access Index (PAI) measured at independence for a sample of 62 former colonies. The index codes access in four domains: political franchise, access to executive constraints, legal uniformity, and educational-economic participation. Descriptive evidence reveals a Settler Colony Paradox: countries commonly treated as benchmarks of inclusive institutions often exhibited substantial exclusion of non-settler populations. Empirically, higher institutional access is associated with lower long-term income inequality. Robustness checks, including jackknife and region-exclusion tests, confirm that this relationship is not driven by outliers. The pattern is non-linear and region-specific. Latin America exhibits high inequality under partial inclusion. Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits high inequality under low access.

Sensor measurements offer greater temporal and spatial resolution and therefore have the potential to complement official monitoring practices. However, the integration of citizen science (CS) data into official frameworks is still limited. CS data are often perceived as “messy”, with barriers such as concerns about data quality, the absence of standard methodologies, and perceptions of unreliability. While these challenges are well-documented, the critical role of infrastructure in bridging CS data and institutional frameworks has received less attention. This study examines the case of Measure Together, a government-funded project and community that functions as a boundary organisation to bridge the gap between CS initiatives and institutional air quality monitoring. We explore how a CS infrastructure emerges through a combination of relational, organisational and technical factors aimed at making sense of CS data. We further analyse how this CS infrastructure is beginning to merge with official monitoring infrastructure, resulting in a hybrid infrastructure that seeks to combine local data and insights from CS with the standardised and rigorous approaches of official monitoring. Our analysis highlights critical tensions, including conflicts between local and generic data, the action-oriented expectations of many CS participants versus the long-term timelines of official infrastructure, and challenges around trust and standardisation. We conclude by identifying pathways to navigate these tensions, emphasizing the need for adaptive, participatory infrastructure that balance rigour with societal relevance, fostering greater integration between CS and official infrastructures.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz37y_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/gz37y_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008520220600539363}, {"title": "Pure global amusia in a professional opera singer", "authors": "Konstantinos Priftis, Bruno Giordano", "abstract": "We tested MK, a professional opera singer who became amusic following a right-hemisphere stroke.

The rapid expansion of digital and textual data has intensified this tension, creating methodological pressures that challenge established qualitative workflows. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as a means of addressing these pressures by enabling large-scale textual processing and synthesis. However, their apparent fluency risks conflating linguistic coherence with interpretation, thereby obscuring judgment, accountability, and scholarly responsibility. This paper argues that the methodological significance of LLMs for qualitative and mixed-methods research lies not in automation but in carefully governed computational assistance. Drawing on qualitative traditions centered on meaning, interpretation, and theory-building, the paper situates LLMs as infrastructural tools whose use must be governed by explicit research design, validation, and reflexive oversight. Particular attention is given to forms of failure that exceed factual error, including bibliographic distortion and loss of structural integrity in scholarly representation. The analysis develops a framework organized around research design patterns, human judgment under computational assistance, and three interrelated dimensions of validity: interpretive, integrative, and bibliographic. Ethical implications concerning consent, representation, bias, and responsibility at scale are also examined. The paper concludes that responsible integration of LLMs requires strengthening—not relaxing—the methodological commitments that define qualitative and mixed-methods inquiry.

Contraceptive labor is conceptualized as the physical, financial, and psychosocial costs and risks structurally embedded in contraceptive methods and unequally distributed between women and men. Using nationally representative data from the German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), we assign partnered women aged 18–49 a method-specific Contraceptive Labor Score (CLS) capturing these structural burdens. Regression analyses show limited support for resource-based explanations: relative employment is not associated with women’s exposure to method-level contraceptive burdens, while women who are more highly educated than their partners are more likely to be exposed to methods with higher CLS values. In contrast, the gender ideology hypothesis holds: women with traditional gender beliefs face higher method-level burdens than egalitarian women. Supplementary analyses using contraceptive efficacy as an alternative outcome show that exposure to method-level burdens does not fully correspond to contraceptive effectiveness. By linking couple-level inequalities to structural characteristics of contraceptive methods, this study extends research on the gendered division of unpaid work to reproductive labor and highlights the role of institutionalized contraceptive arrangements in sustaining women’s disproportionate responsibility for fertility control.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/asfxv_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/asfxv_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.012295680858185998}, {"title": "Asymmetric Party System Fragmentation", "authors": "Riccardo Di Leo, Elias Dinas, Ksenia Northmore-Ball", "abstract": "Extant literature has arguably overlooked the impact of authoritarian ideological legacies on the shape of party systems in newly-established democracies.

We conducted a survey experiment with a German sample (N = 877) in which participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: a control group without labels, a process-based label group (“AI-generated”), or a harm-based label group (“Misleading”). Participants viewed twelve Instagram-style posts, six of which contained AI-generated or AI-altered content. Perceived authenticity was measured by asking whether the depicted events actually occurred. Our results show that both labeling strategies significantly reduced perceived authenticity of AI-generated images, with average reductions of about 0.27 standard deviations. We also find evidence of an implied authenticity effect: exposure to labeled content slightly increased perceived authenticity in unlabeled images (about one-fifth the size of the direct labeling effect). Exploratory analyses indicate that internet skills and age are associated with perceived authenticity differences.

Few researchers can do so individually. This commentary argues that the emerging DSA regime makes research infrastructure a precondition for meaningful and lawful data access. Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and other institutional arrangements can mediate between three actors — researchers, platforms, and Digital Services Coordinators — ensuring trust, compliance, and accountability. In this role, infrastructures become not just technical means but governance interfaces that translate regulatory obligations into practical research conditions. The shift from ad hoc data collection to regulated access requires more than new rules; it demands a reorientation of the research community itself.

This adaptiveness is characterized by the ability to dynamically consider multiple alternatives, update one’s approach as new information emerges, and make flexible, context-sensitive choices to meet evolving challenges. Although infants are often described as efficient and adaptive information seekers, research with preschoolers suggests that truly adaptive decision-making and possibility reasoning emerge only later in childhood. This apparent discrepancy raises important questions about how children develop the ability to integrate possibility reasoning into adaptive information search and decision-making under uncertainty. To address this gap, we designed a novel paradigm to investigate whether younger preschoolers can adjust their exploratory strategies in response to the probability structure of a task. In Experiment 1, 2- and 3-year-old children (n = 156) chose between two actions in a Search task (searching for a ball) and two boxes in a Catch task (catching a ball). Before the test, they learned about the probability structure where the ball was either more likely to come from one exit (Skewed condition) or equally likely from any exit (Uniform condition).

Using a representative survey of 1,671 Muslim immigrants in Germany and a preregistered online survey experiment, we investigate the effects of inclusive religious messages on intergroup attitudes. Our observational analyses indicate that Muslims who hear sermons from non-politicized (vs. politicized) religious leaders are less likely to justify religiously motivated violence, feel hostility toward Christians, and are more likely to identify with both their ethnic and national groups. These effects are mediated by identity inclusiveness. The experimental results reveal that exposure to an inclusive sermon from a prototypical religious leader reduces support for religiously motivated violence and hostility toward Christians but does not affect other attitudes. Finally, we find that immigrants who listen to sermons from politicized religious leaders are no more resistant to changing their attitudes in response to inclusive sermons than others.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/xp25n_v2", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/xp25n_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.9869861230370054}, {"title": "When Opportunity Fails: A Qualitative Exploration of Pathways to Homelessness among Central and Eastern European Labor Migrants in the Netherlands", "authors": "Simone 't Hooft, Margriet Lenkens, Sarah E.

The silent evaluation phase has received less attention than in silico algorithm development or formal clinical evaluations, despite increasing recognition of this type of evaluation as a critical phase in an effective translation process for healthcare AI tools. There are currently no formal guidelines for conducting silent AI evaluations in health settings. We undertook a scoping review to identify silent AI evaluations described in the literature, aiming to summarize current practices for the conduct of silent evaluations. We screened PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases for articles fitting our criteria for silent AI evaluations, or ‘silent trials’, published from 2015 to 2025. A total of 891 articles were identified, and 75 met the criteria for inclusion into the final review. We found wide variance in terminology, description, and rationale for silent evaluations; this led to substantial heterogeneity in what was reported. Overwhelmingly, papers reported measurement of AUC, precision/recall, positive and negative predictive values and similar technical performance metrics. Far fewer studies reported the verification of outputs against an in-situ clinical ground truth, and, when reported, the comprehensiveness of such verification was highly variable. We noted relatively less discussion of sociotechnical components such as stakeholder engagement and human-computer interaction elements. We conclude that there is an opportunity to bring together diverse evaluative practices (e.g., from data science, human factors, and other fields) if the silent evaluation phase is to be maximally effective as a translational mechanism these gaps mirror challenges in effective translation of AI tools from “computer to bedside” and identify opportunities to improve silent evaluation protocols that address key translational needs.

A comparative case study of Germany, Sweden, and Russia (1990–2020)", "authors": "Johannes Due Enstad", "abstract": "Public concern about antisemitism has increased globally in the 21st century, sparking renewed interest from social scientists. However, the crucial question of why trajectories of antisemitic hostility differ between countries remains unanswered due to a lack of studies designed to track temporal and cross-national variation. Addressing this gap, I evaluate the explanatory power of two main lines of argument that divide the literature: generalist and particularist. While generalists see antisemitism as a manifestation of general outgroup hostility common to various forms of prejudice, particularists stress the contextual specificity of antisemitism and posit that its 21st-century expressions are distinctively linked to antizionist sentiment (enmity toward Israel and its supporters). I derive observable implications from these positions and conduct a comparative, longitudinal case study of antisemitic hostility in Germany, Sweden, and Russia (1990--2020), using a mixed-methods approach to integrate incident counts, victimization surveys, media analysis, and expert interviews. Findings match predictions from the particularist position, with flare-ups in the Israel-Palestine conflict generating or catalyzing antisemitic hostility depending on the strength of local antizionist sentiment, thus demonstrating the centrality of the \"Israel factor\" in contemporary antisemitism.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2x6ws_v2", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/2x6ws_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0340917136977571}, {"title": "Fear-Based Decision-Making in Public Administration: A Conceptual Framework and Five-Type Typology", "authors": "RALPH RENDELL TOLEDO", "abstract": "Public administration systems have intensified accountability and oversight to address corruption, inefficiency, and misuse of public resources. These developments have reinforced an audit society in which verification and performance control increasingly shape everyday administrative routines. Although scholarship widely documents proceduralism, risk aversion, and compliance-oriented behavior under audit-intensive regimes, it has paid limited attention to the behavioral mechanism through which these outcomes are systematically produced. This paper develops the Fear-Based Decision-Making Framework, positioning fear as an institutionalized mechanism linking audit culture and asymmetric accountability to conservative administrative behavior. Using theory-driven conceptual synthesis across Audit Culture Theory, Risk Aversion Theory, and Behavioral Public Administration, the analysis integrates evidence from peer-reviewed literature and institutional reports, with comparative attention to Western and ASEAN governance contexts. The synthesis shows that expanding audit regimes tend to redefine accountability around documentation and procedural defensibility, encouraging anticipatory compliance and narrowing discretionary space. Conservative administrative behavior commonly manifests as rigid rule adherence, documentation inflation, defensive standardization, and discretion avoidance, reflecting loss-avoidance incentives under conditions of retrospective scrutiny. The framework specifies five-part typology of fear: anticipatory, sanction, reputational, interpretive, and institutionalized, and explains how ASEAN scholarship often masks fear-driven behavior through proxy framings such as capacity and compliance narratives. By making fear analytically explicit, the paper reframes conservative administration as an accountability design problem and provides a basis for developing testable propositions and governance reforms that protect integrity without systematically constraining discretion and judgment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/udrav_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/udrav_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0036089279906275085}, {"title": "한국의 복지균열 부상에 관한 연구", "authors": "Jihun Yeo", "abstract": "이 연구의 목적은 경제성장담론이 지배적이던 한국정치에서 복지담론 및 전선이 부상한 요인을 규명하는 것이다. 경제 구조의 변화의 기존 규범에의 작용 및 시민사회 내 헤게모니를 둘러싼 담론투쟁 이론을 통해 2009년 무상급식부터 2012년 대선 시기 복지담론의 활성화 및 복지균열의 부상 요인을 추적하였다. 저 발달한 발전주의 복지레짐과 신자유주의 경제정책의 연계된 정책효과는 사회양극화, 빈 곤층 확대 등을 초래하였고, 이것은 ‘경제성장이 민생문제를 해결한다’는 기존의 규범을 약화 시켰다. 경제성장이 민생문제를 해결한다고 주장하고 집권한 이명박 정부의 정당성이 약화되 고, 2009년 경기교육감과 경기의회의 갈등을 계기로 무상급식 논쟁이 촉발하였다. 그리고 시 민사회 내 시민, 사회단체들은 사적이익을 공적이익으로 전환하고, 사회적 정당성을 획득하기 위한 담론투쟁을 전개한다. 이를 통해 국민여론이 무상급식 및 복지에 대한 지지로 변화하였 다. 복지에 대한 국민적 지지를 확인한 정당들은 특정 위기 국면에서 복지를 수용할 정치적 이익이 있는 세력 우선적으로 복지를 수용하게 된다. 그리고 여론, 시민사회단체들의 계속적인 압력 속에서, 선거에서 복지 이슈를 선점하기 위해 양당은 전면적으로 복지를 수용하고, 이후 이것은 경제민주화담론으로 이어지게 된다.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/apdmb_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/apdmb_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02577133230300832}, {"title": "Opportunities for Participatory Design in Shaping Australia’s Data Centre Futures", "authors": "Bronwyn Cumbo", "abstract": "This paper examines how Participatory Design (PD) can be scaled to address ‘vertical inequities’ emerging between industry and government actors, and local communities and environments through Australia’s expanding data centre industry.

The decline of this practice is analysed within the broader context of Western-driven development, agri-food industrialisation, and liberalisation of the edible oil sector. The study examines epistemological tensions between traditional and modern knowledge, the sociocultural and economic significance of the ghani, and the extent to which artisanal practices can coexist with industrial production in contemporary India. A hybrid deductive–inductive approach was employed, combining a literature review with fieldwork conducted in India. This comprised two surveys allowing both quantitative and qualitative analysis of contributions from a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society, ghani workers, NGOs, industry representatives, and academics. Findings reveal declining visibility and practical knowledge of the ghani, yet also a strong sociocultural resonance. This paradox reveals a fading practice that continues to embody memory, identity, and resistance to the homogenisation of global models. Economically, small producers face severe disadvantages in competing with industrial plants and cheap imports, while niche markets provide only limited opportunities for survival. The analysis shows how industrial and policy frameworks structurally marginalise artisans, relegating them to peripheral or subordinated roles, while simultaneously rebranding elements of their cultural value for urban elite markets. This process of “eliticisation” risks detaching artisanal production from its community base, transforming a once accessible tradition into a niche commodity. The study concludes that the decline of the ghani is emblematic of wider processes of epistemic injustice, whereby capitalist globalisation privileges industrial efficiency and consumerist appropriation over cultural continuity, social equity, and ecological sustainability. It calls for a reimagined food system in which artisanal and industrial modes of production are integrated on more equitable terms. Such an approach would recognise the cultural and ecological contributions of traditional practices while harnessing the capacities of modern industry, generating hybrid models that are both more socially just and environmentally resilient. Safeguarding institutions like the ghani is thus not a nostalgic exercise but a vital step towards building plural, inclusive, and sustainable futures.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/th65d_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/th65d_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0183186521882156}, {"title": "Anger Is Like Chocolate — A Socio-Ecological Model of Emotional Indulgence —", "authors": "Koichi Hiraoka", "abstract": "Anger has long been regarded as an adaptive emotion in human evolution, functioning as a mechanism for negotiation, deterrence, and the correction of unfair treatment. However, in contemporary societies characterized by dense institutional arrangements and long-term social interaction, anger frequently manifests not as an adaptive response but as a source of interpersonal disruption, psychological insecurity, and harassment. Despite its apparent maladaptiveness, anger persists and, in some environments, proliferates. This study proposes a novel theoretical framework, the Anger-as-Indulgence Model (AIM), which conceptualizes anger not as a mere emotional reaction or personality trait, but as an emotional resource that is selected, consumed, and reproduced within socio-ecological systems. Drawing on evolutionary psychology, behavioral economics, neuroscience, meme theory, and the author’s prior work on emotional contagion, formal sanction loops, and reverse selection, AIM explains how anger becomes repeatedly chosen through immediate psychological rewards, reward expectations, institutional legitimation, and environmental selection pressure. Central to this model is the redefinition of anger as an indulgent emotion analogous to a consumer good: not physiologically necessary, yet repeatedly consumed due to its reliable short-term rewards, despite long-term social costs. Through anonymized case studies, this paper demonstrates that the indulgent transformation of anger is not dependent on individual personality traits, but on isomorphic socio-ecological configurations across different times, locations, and occupational contexts. The findings suggest that conventional interventions focusing on emotional regulation or moral instruction are insufficient as long as anger remains embedded in reward-generating institutional arrangements. Instead, effective intervention requires reconfiguring environments so that anger no longer produces psychological or organizational rewards. By shifting the analytical focus from managing anger to repositioning it within socio-ecological systems, this study offers a unified explanation for anger dependence, contagion, institutionalization, silence, and avoidance, and provides a structural foundation for addressing anger-related dysfunctions in modern organizations and societies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mx9pb_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/mx9pb_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009815817992595566}, {"title": "Prosedur Penyusutan Arsip Pada BPJS Ketenagakerjaan Cabang Banda Aceh", "authors": "Muhammad Dzar Alghifari, Zahriatul Aini", "abstract": "The archives are one of the important sources of information that can support the processes of administrative and bureaucratic activities.

Here, we present the design and evaluation of a campaign to reduce demand for bear bile, founded on the principles of conservation marketing. We used a Theory of Change informed by baseline consumer research and consultations with international and local stakeholders to guide the design of the campaign. We used quantitative surveys to measure the prevalence of bear bile use in a Before-After-Control-Treatment (BACT) design (n = 1,690 individuals (pre-campaign: 767; post-campaign: 923)). Bear bile use declined by 97% in our treatment site (from 16% (CI: 12 – 19%) to 1% (CI: 0.3 – 2%)), and did not change significantly in the control site. We can conclude that our campaign did change behavior, and reduced demand for bear bile in our target community.
