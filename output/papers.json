[{"title": "The public agglomeration effect: Urban–rural divisions in government efficiency and political preferences", "authors": "Theo Serlin", "abstract": "Why and when do cities vote for the left? The emergence of the urban–rural divide in the United States in the 1930s is inconsistent with canonical theories of cleavages. This paper introduces an explanation: agglomeration effects. The provision of government services is more efficient in urban environments because of nonrivalries, economies of scale, and access costs. If the public sector in cities is more efficient, and voters face a trade‐off between taxation and government spending, urban voters support more spending. When redistribution is salient, one should observe an urban–rural electoral divide. As predicted by a formal model, more‐urban locations faced lower costs of providing public services and shifted toward the Democrats as the party implemented the New Deal. In addition, urban voters were more supportive of government spending. In the United Kingdom, the urban–rural divide also accompanied the rise of redistributive politics. Agglomeration effects influence preferences for redistribution and create political cleavages.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70023", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70023", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012089593954147881}, {"title": "An ecclesiastical court: Christian nationalism and perceptions of the US Supreme Court", "authors": "Miles T.

The literature we review suggests that government actions during this era were shaped by neoliberal principles that established powerful ideological and institutional constraints. To promote trade and growth, political leaders and policymakers were committed to reducing government's footprint in the economy. That commitment inhibited both their interest in and ability to respond to globalization's impact, fostering an environment ripe for antiglobalist political entrepreneurs.

We analyze market valuations of publicly traded multinationals on US financial markets before and after the announcement. On the day of the executive order, former FCPA targets whose stocks are publicly traded experienced returns on equity markets that were about 0.69 percentage points higher than what would have been expected from stock market trends. The effects cumulated substantively, resulting in capitalization gains for the portfolio of past targets of corporate corruption cases of about USD 39 billion and outsized returns to shareholders. These results allow us to contribute to long-standing debates about how much of the costs multinationals experience from corruption are due to legal enforcement versus the inefficiency and uncertainty it generates for firm operations. When legal enforcement is removed, valuations of firms at risk of corruption rise dramatically, indicating that investors perceive the legal costs as an important threat to investment in corrupt firms.

Finally, we demonstrate that analogical reasoning is no more effective at moving public opinion than other types of rational justifications leaders use, such as appeals to experts, and that these other communication strategies impact public opinion through similar mechanisms as analogies.

Second, congressional veto threats can exert substantial influence on the centralization/politicization decision apart from altering agency ideology.

I argue that there are two highly salient sites of contact with the administrative state when considering effects on voter turnout: government programs and elections. I theorize that administrative burden from these sites creates interpretive effects on both those with direct public program experience and those whose experience is indirect, which shapes the likelihood of voting. Using a generalized differences-in-differences design and applying my separate, original measures of Medicaid and electoral burdens, I find that having a higher level of Medicaid burden resulted in a small but significant decrease in county-level turnout in recent national elections, net of Medicaid expansion status, burdens associated with registering to vote and voting, and other factors.

In Study 2, we interviewed activists ( N = 20) and found six key dimensions underlying those actions. In Study 3, participants ( N = 273) rated the actions across the dimensions. Based upon the (dis)similarities of each action's rating across the dimensions, we identified two main types and five subtypes of online collective actions: Ingroup‐assisting actions (collaborative resource generation, ingroup mobilization, and digital picketing) and outgroup‐attacking actions (disruptive clicktivism and technology‐enabled attacks). The results showed that digital collective actions substantively differ from each other based on the six underlying dimensions, from the social psychological function, to the skill required, to the groups being targeted. This work offers a multi‐dimensional explanation for the variations across the domain of online activism and offers a way forward for future collective action work to explore psychological motivations underlying choices across action type.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70097", "doi": "10.1111/pops.70097", "journal_full": "Political Psychology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006589786260803643}, {"title": "Teaching Israel-Palestine Across the Atlantic: Addressing Affective Polarization and Dehumanization through Dialogic Education", "authors": "Ilkim Buke Okyar, Sebnem Gumuscu", "abstract": "This article examines the pedagogical challenges and opportunities of teaching the Israeli–Palestinian conflict amid rising global polarization and campus tensions. We report on a cross-institutional course taught concurrently at Middlebury College (United States) and Yeditepe University (Turkey) after October 7 that was designed to address affective polarization and dehumanization through dialogic education. Drawing on mixed methods including pre- and post-semester surveys, student reflections, and podcast projects, we assess the impact of dialogic practices such as structured dialogue, active listening, and engagement with Israeli and Palestinian peace activists. Our findings indicate that dialogic classrooms (1) deepen historical and analytical understanding of the conflict, (2) foster empathy and curiosity, (3) mitigate polarization even in politically divided contexts, and (4) humanize opposing perspectives without erasing convictions. These results underscore the value of dialogic pedagogy for teaching contentious topics across sociopolitical boundaries and suggest its adaptability to other polarizing issues in political science.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096525101674", "doi": "10.1017/s1049096525101674", "journal_full": "PS: Political Science & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.1727144743450365}, {"title": "Simulating Three Foreign Policy Decision-Making Models with 13 Days", "authors": "Jordan Roberts", "abstract": "This article describes a novel series of classroom simulations for teaching Graham Allison’s (1971) three seminal models of foreign policy decision making (i.e., the Rational Actor Model, the Organizational Process Model, and the Bureaucratic Politics Model) and demonstrates the effectiveness of those simulations.

While often portrayed as ideological opposites, the analysis suggests that Trump and Biden operate within a shared emotional grammar: both mobilize longing for the past, symbolic restoration, and moral clarity to emotionally realign a fragmented electorate. Instagram, with its aesthetics of intimacy and symbolic condensation, enhances these strategies by offering a visual vocabulary attuned to affective public sentiment. The analysis explores how both leaders engage with and reshape prevailing emotional undercurrents in American society, focusing on how emotion functions as a narrative resource in digital political communication.

Central to these debates is the question of AI alignment—how well AI systems meet public expectations regarding safety, fairness, and social values. However, little is known about what people expect from AI-enabled systems and how these expectations differ across national contexts. We present evidence from two surveys of public preferences for key functional features of AI-enabled systems in Germany ( n = 1800) and the United States ( n = 1756). We examine support for four types of alignment in AI moderation: accuracy and reliability, safety, bias mitigation, and the promotion of aspirational imaginaries. U.S. respondents report significantly higher AI use and consistently greater support for all alignment features, reflecting broader technological openness and higher societal involvement with AI. In both countries, accuracy and safety enjoy the strongest support, while more normatively charged goals—like fairness and aspirational imaginaries—receive more cautious backing, particularly in Germany. We also explore how individual experience with AI, attitudes toward free speech, political ideology, partisan affiliation, and gender shape these preferences. AI use and free speech support explain more variation in Germany. In contrast, U.S. responses show greater attitudinal uniformity, suggesting that higher exposure to AI may consolidate public expectations.

Drawing on fieldwork in the French Assemblée Nationale and a descriptive mapping of MPs’ social media presences, I find that even as digital communications practices have converged, norms around the legitimacy of social media use in parliamentary work have not. On the one hand, engagement metrics provide guidance in the face of uncertainty, becoming normalized as markers of professionalism. On the other hand, institutional norms reject overt pursuits of ‘virality’. This creates a normative double bind for politicians, at once incentivizing them to adapt to platform demands and punishing communications that maximize metrics at any cost. Depending on party culture and institutional position, politicians have different levels of leeway in resolving this conflict.

We consider three versions of the CCE, which we evaluate within a simple representative agent economic model: (i) a three-box setting comparable to DICE-2016, (ii) a four-box extension, and (iii) a four-box version that explicitly captures land-use change. While the three-box model reproduces benchmark results well and the fourth reservoir adds little, incorporating the impact of land-use change on the carbon storage capacity of the terrestrial biosphere substantially alters atmospheric carbon stocks, temperature trajectories, and the optimal mitigation path. Second, we investigate pattern-scaling techniques that transform global-mean temperature projections from CEs into spatially heterogeneous warming fields. We show how regional baseline climates, non-uniform warming, and the associated uncertainties propagate into economic damages.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf131", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueaf131", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007866339520609333}, {"title": "Nonlinear Monetary Policy Tradeoffs", "authors": "Davide Debortoli, Mario Forni, Luca Gambetti, Luca Sala", "abstract": "We measure the inflation-unemployment tradeoff associated with monetary easing and tightening, during booms and recessions, using a novel nonlinear Proxy-SVAR approach.

This paper examines the consequences of ocean acidification for child health, using data from coastal regions in 36 low- and middle-income countries from 1972 to 2018, encompassing 41% of the world’s coastal population. Leveraging short-term exogenous shifts in ocean acidity near human settlements for identification, we find that prenatal exposure to higher water acidity significantly raises the risk of death in the first months of life and impacts early childhood development. We show evidence consistent with these effects being associated with maternal malnutrition, as increased acidity reduces catches for small-scale fisheries, increasing seafood prices and reducing consumption of crucial nutrients. Our findings indicate limited adaptation to these impacts. We estimate that, absent intervention, ocean acidification could contribute to as many as 77 million neonatal deaths in this region by 2100—a consequence that should not be ignored in the projected cost of climate change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaf054", "doi": "10.1093/jeea/jvaf054", "journal_full": "Journal of the European Economic Association", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.026613585705165033}, {"title": "The Role of Caseworkers: Job Finding, Job Quality and Determinants of Value-Added,", "authors": "Jonas Cederlöf, Martin Söderström, Johan Vikström", "abstract": "We study the importance of caseworkers and their role in supporting unemployed job seekers.

Measuring the Impacts on Independent Businesses Using Matched U.S. Tax Returns", "authors": "Nirupama Rao, Max Risch", "abstract": "A common concern surrounding minimum wage policies is their impact on independent businesses, which are often feared to be less able to bear or pass on cost increases. We examine how these typically small- and medium-size firms accommodate minimum wage increases along product and labor market margins using a matched owner-firm-worker panel dataset drawn from the universe of U.S. tax records over a 10-year period, and using state minimum wage changes as identifying variation. We find that, on average, firms in highly exposed industries do not substantially reduce employment — they do not layoff workers but moderately reduce part-time hiring. Instead, these firms are able to fully finance the new labor costs with new revenues, leaving average owner profits unchanged. Higher wage floors, however, forestall entry, particularly of less productive firms, reducing the number of independent firms operating in these industries by roughly 2%. Yet, these industries do not shrink; instead, incumbent responses and strong positive selection among entrants reshape industries that rely heavily on low-wage workers, yielding fewer but more productive firms after the cost shock. We also take a worker-level perspective to examine how potentially vulnerable individuals are affected by minimum wage increases. Using panels of low-earning and young workers, we find that their average earnings rise substantially with the minimum wage, while they are no less likely to be employed. Worker transitions indicate that minimum wage increases boost retention and that worker reallocation from independent firms toward corporations buffers disemployment impacts from reduced hiring at independent firms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf053", "doi": "10.1093/qje/qjaf053", "journal_full": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009802051686199076}, {"title": "Marginal Returns to Public Universities", "authors": "Jack Mountjoy", "abstract": "This paper studies the returns to enrolling in American public universities by comparing the long-term outcomes of barely admitted versus barely rejected applicants. I use administrative admission records spanning all 35 public universities in Texas, which collectively enroll 10 percent of all American public university students, to systematically identify and employ decentralized cutoffs in SAT/ACT scores that generate discontinuities in admission and enrollment. The typical marginally admitted student gains an additional year of education in the four-year sector, becomes 12 percentage points more likely to ever earn a bachelor’s degree, and eventually earns 8 percent more than their marginally rejected but otherwise identical counterpart. Marginally admitted students pay no additional tuition costs thanks to offsetting grant aid; cost-benefit calculations show internal rates of return of 26 percent for the marginal students themselves, 16 percent for society (which must pay for the additional education), and 7 percent for the government budget. Earnings gains are similar across admitting institutions of varying selectivity, but smaller for students from low-income families, who spend more time enrolled but complete fewer degrees and major in less lucrative fields.

This study examines the gap between Uganda’s acclaimed refugee policies and localized realities in Yumbe and Nebbi districts along borders with South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo, investigating how three intersecting dynamics complicate integration: hybrid governance arrangements combining state and customary authority, infrastructural fragmentation in resource-constrained contexts, and refugee agency operating alongside formal policy structures. Through qualitative fieldwork incorporating stakeholder interviews, ethnographic observation, and secondary data analysis, the research reveals significant disjunctures between policy aspirations and implementation capacities. Findings demonstrate how initial hospitality dynamics transform into resource competition as local infrastructure becomes strained, while formal state institutions coexist with customary governance structures where traditional authorities wield substantial influence over land allocation and conflict mediation. These hybrid arrangements both facilitate and complicate integration as documented refugees, undocumented migrants, and cross-border communities compete for water, healthcare, education, and housing. The study highlights gendered displacement vulnerabilities, with women migrants facing heightened exploitation risks. This analysis contributes to forced migration scholarship by demonstrating the limitations of state-centric governance approaches in borderland contexts, where spatial specificities and institutional layering fundamentally reshape policy implementation. Policy implications emphasize strengthening coordination between governmental and traditional institutions, formalizing land tenure rights, and transitioning toward sustainable development investments that recognize refugees’ economic contributions to borderland economies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00508-1", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00508-1", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9533490986270662}, {"title": "Understanding housing market challenges and barriers for the integration of forced migrants: a cross-European perspective", "authors": "Yvonne Franz, Annegret Haase, Ursula Reeger, Anika Schmidt, Ivette Arroyo, Karlis Lakševics, Bahanur Nasya", "abstract": "This paper explores the challenges and barriers of forced migrants at the nexus of housing and social integration, presenting the outcomes of an international and interdisciplinary collaboration funded by the JPI Urban Europe programme.

Our analysis reveals a complex landscape of public opinion: the largest single group of respondents (nearly 40%) considers both mistakes to be equally serious, declining to prioritize one over the other. Among those who do choose, there is a significant preference for avoiding false negatives. We find that these distinct positions are not random. Attitudes on this issue are strongly associated with overall asylum policy preferences, and key predictors such as welfare chauvinism, nativism, and political ideology systematically distinguish those who prioritize false negatives, those who prioritize false positives, and those who view both errors as equally grave.

These migrations are often driven by economic factors, with young people seeking to take advantage of opportunities that are less available at their places of origin. At the centre of these migrations are the range of decisions young people go through, which are often not entirely taken by themselves alone. In this context, we explore via a qualitative investigation of young migrants in Accra, Ghana, the decision‐making processes these young migrants engaged in to understand the complex system of interactions involved. Data collection employed in‐depth interviews and focus group discussions among migrants of 15–24 years from within Ghana, and other neighbouring West African countries, bound together by the ECOWAS Protocol on free movement; namely, Togo, Nigeria, Cameroon, Burkina Faso and Niger. Our findings reveal that for young migrants, ‘independent’ pre‐migration decision means less dependent on household parents but often linked to supportive roles including funds provision by their peers, parents and other close relatives abroad that concretize their final decisions to migrate.

Using an approach that has successfully uncovered structure in other domains of cognition, we examined covariation in behavioral performance on diverse nonliteral comprehension tasks across two large samples to search for shared and distinct components of pragmatic language use. In Experiment 1, n = 376 participants each completed an 8 h battery of 20 critical tasks. Controlling for general cognitive ability, an exploratory factor analysis revealed three clusters, which can be post hoc interpreted as corresponding to i) understanding social conventions (critical for phenomena such as indirect requests, conversational implicatures, and irony), ii) interpreting contrastive and emotional intonation patterns, and iii) making causal inferences based on world knowledge.

We evaluated whether birth without labor was associated with differences in child hair cortisol, an integrated measure of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal activity that influences growth, metabolism, immunity, and behavior. Using longitudinal data from singleton births in the 2015 Pelotas Birth Cohort in Brazil ( N = 6 , 136 observations from 3,537 participants), we found that 4 to 7 y old children born through planned CS before labor had 6.6% lower hair cortisol than children born vaginally ( P = 0.002 ) and 4.4% lower cortisol than children born from unplanned CS after labor ( P = 0.017 ). There were no significant differences in hair cortisol levels between children born vaginally and through CS after labor, suggesting that labor exposure, rather than CS delivery, is associated with the observed differences. A significant interaction between labor experience and gestational age indicated that differences were most pronounced among children born without labor at earlier gestational ages; adjusted differences between planned CS and vaginal delivery were significant before 39.5 wk gestation.

To date, no systematic theory or methodology adequately captures the dynamics of animals as political agents, local governance, and policy support. Recent studies have begun to close this gap by examining governance and political participation in response to wild boars, support for local environmental morality policies, and the governance challenges posed by perceived harm. Building on these contributions, the present study introduces willingness to pay additional local taxes as a novel indicator of policy support, linking human–wildlife interactions to public finance, distributive fairness, and citizen compliance. Drawing on a quantitative, large‐scale survey experiment (2020) and a choice‐based conjoint analysis, supplemented by longitudinal trend indicators (2019–2024) for contextualization, we examine the individual, environmental, and political factors shaping residents' support for a local policy aimed at addressing urban environmental challenges. We use respondents' willingness to pay more taxes as a proxy for their support of the policy. Our findings show that individual and environmental factors negatively influence this willingness, whereas political incentives exert a positive effect.

Drawing from collective action and cognitive theories, we conceptualize planning as an organization-level inference process of selecting strategies to minimize gaps between expected and desired futures. Responding to public administration scholars who have called for advancing theories of managing risks, we examine whether local planning processes are responsive to community disadvantages and how the administrative arrangements and coordination efforts of local governments influence this sensitivity. In doing so, we highlight a phenomenon labeled organizational divergence, in which a collective’s perceived community disadvantages differ from reality. Examining climate action, economic development and sustainability plans, combined with survey and spatial data on environmental burdens for 462 municipal governments, we find evidence, using a multiphase Bayesian analytic strategy, that institutional designs which empower professional city managers increase the probability cities will engage in broader types of planning but decrease the odds they will prioritize social vulnerabilities. However, these cities are more likely to minimize divergence relative to mobility and water-related vulnerabilities. Conversely, greater functional coordination across governmental units increases the probability of prioritizing vulnerabilities in planning but also increases organizational divergence.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf034", "doi": "10.1093/jopart/muaf034", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007471365116911821}, {"title": "Does Institutional Transparency Affect Citizen Trust in Predictive Policing?

Using administrative pension insurance records linked with survey data, we combine sequence and cluster analyses with regression models to study the late working lives in Germany across three decades of birth cohorts until 2019. Results demonstrate a gradual shift from early retirement trajectories to the “standard” type of retirement, with persistent disparities by education level.

Using a comparative study of 35 elections and two quasi-experimental case studies, we find that while differences between winners and losers in their support for norms of restraint and consent can be statistically significant, they are substantively small compared to several benchmarks, even in highly polarized contexts.

Wright, Bradley Velasquez, Shaina Sta Cruz", "abstract": "Background: From 2022 to 2024, an annual, nationally representative, longitudinal survey in the United States (US) found high prevalences of support for and willingness to engage in political violence, with differences by party affiliation. The November 2024 US federal election replaced a Democratic administration with a Republican one, led by a president who has repeatedly endorsed use of force by the government against civilians. This study examines changes in support for and willingness to engage in political violence from mid-2024 to mid-2025. Methods: Survey participants were adult (age ≥ 18 years as of recruitment in 2022) members of Ipsos Knowledge Panel. Wave 4 was conducted May 23-June 13, 2025. The primary analysis generated findings for the cohort as a whole. In a secondary analysis, respondents were categorized by self-reported political party and Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement affiliations. Principal outcome measures comprised self-reported justification for political violence, personal willingness to engage in political violence, and expectation of firearm use in future political violence. Results for 2025 were presented as weighted prevalences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Change from 2024 to 2025 was estimated based on the means of aggregated individual change scores for each outcome measure. Results: The 2025 completion rate was 89.9% (8,248 respondents/9,179 invitees). For the cohort as a whole, there were only small increases from 2024 to 2025 in the prevalence of the belief that violence was usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 20 political objectives (2024: 32.3%, 95% CI 31.0%, 33.6%; 2025: 35.6%, 95% CI 34.1%, 37.0%) and to advance 16 of 20 specified objectives when these were assessed individually. There were no changes in the prevalence of high-level personal willingness to commit political violence or in expectation of firearm use in future political violence. Despite some increases in support for political violence from 2024 to 2025 among Democrats, MAGA Republicans in 2025 were substantially more likely than strong Democrats to consider violence usually or always justified to advance at least 1 of 20 political objectives (MAGA Republicans 52.2%, 95% CI 48.4%, 56.1%; strong Democrats 32.1%, 95% CI 28.6%, 35.6%) and to advance 10 of those objectives when objectives were considered individually. MAGA Republicans and strong Democrats did not differ in 2025 in the percentages that were very or completely willing to commit political violence by level of severity or against any target population. A small group of non-Republican MAGA supporters had higher prevalences than most other groups on many measures. Conclusions: Support for and willingness to commit political violence increased only modestly from 2024 to 2025 and, where differences existed, remained generally higher among MAGA movement affiliates and Republicans than among Democrats.

Loss ratios rise sharply in high-damage years, but decline only modestly in low-damage years. Combining sensitivities with insurers' portfolio compositions, we construct an insurer-level vulnerability metric and find that vulnerability is highly skewed.

Drawing on survey data from a representative sample of 250 German farmers, we assessed farmers’ intention to use and their willingness-to-pay for DSTs for wheat fungicide application either based on AI or a human advisor. We implemented a novel Bayesian probabilistic programming workflow tailored to experimental studies, enabling a joint analysis that integrates an extended version of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with an economic experiment. Our results indicate that AA plays an important role in farmers’ decision-making. For most farmers, an AI-based DST must outperform a human advisor by 11–30% to be considered equally valuable.

Not only are phenomena such as climate change, widespread pollution, biodiversity loss, and soil artificialisation threatening irreversibly the ‘natural’ world. They imperil human society too, for human society is part of nature. Taking a historical materialist perspective, this thesis understands those crises as originating in capitalist social relations, which maximise the exploitation of both human labour and the ecosystems. The thesis maintains that mainstream responses to the crises are fully framed within the capitalist paradigm of perpetual and privatised ‘accumulation for accumulation’s sake’, only now legitimised through ‘green’ credentials. Building on theoretical and political approaches calling for the incorporation of an ‘ecological’ rationality within capitalist relations, these responses articulate faith in and commitment to the modernisation of productive cycles and governance systems, from which a more sustainable – ‘green’ – capitalist economy can apparently arise. Differently, this thesis interprets such a ‘green’ turn as capitalism’s adaptation and expansion in the context of the ecological crises. The thesis deploys and innovates a range of historical materialist categories to analyse the relationship between the ‘green’ as an accumulation opportunity and its leveraging as a legitimation framework. Empirically, the thesis investigates the accumulation of surplus value in and around renewable energy generation at the level of production areas, the enclosure and trans-formative processes it triggers, the class and factional cleavages it entails, and the regulatory mechanisms and legitimation narratives to which it is associated. Methodologically, it combines a comprehensive theoretical elaboration with case studies in southern Italy on wind energy and in eastern Germany on agricultural biogas. The thesis maintains that under capitalism, renewable energy generation expands accumulation frontiers over not yet or ‘inefficiently’ commodified spaces and natures. This occurs through their privatisation and abstraction into fictitious capital –that is through their commodification and financialization. In contrast with marginalist approaches, this thesis reconciles the socially necessary labour time theory of value with political ecology. It rejects the assumption that privatised spaces and natures might ‘innately’ provide exchange value, maintaining that they serve as a collateral to capture –by way of rent- surplus value produced in society at a different point in time and space. Secondly, the thesis defines ‘green’ capitalism as a hegemonic project in the making. This is characterised by two dialectics: one tending to restructure the forces and relations of production; the other to re-build hegemonic narratives and apparatuses, around re-significations of the ‘green’ made compatible with sustained accumulation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/btjp7_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/btjp7_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.03619035815077265}, {"title": "EXTENDING THEORIES OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: SUBSYSTEM-DRIVEN INNOVATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEM MACROEVOLUTION", "authors": "Mario Coccia", "abstract": "Forecasting technological trajectories requires understanding the mechanisms that accelerate systemic innovation.

Second, there is a non-monotonic effect on economic growth. Contrary to conventional wisdom, lordships towns did not underperform royal towns during the Ancien Régime. Yet, despite not having started with disadvantage, former seigneurial towns experienced lower population growth from the 1910s onwards, a period in which the Spanish state started to play a bigger investment role.

Yet important concerns remain about trust, transparency, bias, privacy, and the adequacy of existing regulatory frameworks. The objective of this study was to compare the perspectives of Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) and non-HCPs on the integration of AI in healthcare, with a focus on identifying perceived benefits, risks, ethical concerns, and barriers to adoption. Methods: We conducted an IRB-approved cross-sectional survey of adults aged ≥18, sampling both HCPs and non-HCPs. The questionnaire assessed perceived benefits and risks of AI, trust in AI systems, health bot applications, privacy and ethical concerns, regulatory priorities, and views on AI’s role in clinical decision-making. Responses from HCPs and non-HCPs were compared using descriptive statistics and group-level difference testing. Results: A total of 297 participants completed the survey, including 189 HCPs and 108 non- HCPs. Both groups expressed strong agreement that AI can improve efficiency, enhance access to care, support diagnosis, reduce medical errors, and aid early disease detection. However, trust in AI systems remained limited: nearly two-thirds of respondents expressed no confidence in AI’s ability to ensure privacy, safeguard data, or make unbiased ethical decisions. HCPs demonstrated greater emphasis on safety, accountability, transparency, and regulatory oversight, particularly in high-risk clinical environments, whereas non-HCPs were more likely to endorse shared responsibility when AI causes harm. Across groups, the majority believed that AI should serve primarily as an assistive tool, with humans retaining decision-making authority. Concerns about cost, infrastructure, and digital literacy were prominent barriers to equitable AI adoption. Conclusions: Despite recognizing AI’s potential benefits, both clinicians and the public remain cautious about its risks and ethical limitations.

Established normalization techniques, such as percentage scaling and standardization, suffer from fundamental limitations: the former disregards the underlying data distribution, while the latter compromises interpretability and does not yield a true interval scale. This paper introduces the Universal Adaptive Normalization Scale (Adaptive Multi-Interval Scale — AMIS), a novel method designed to address this methodological gap. The key advantage of AMIS is its ability to construct a unified metric space, enabling mathematically sound arithmetic operations between inherently disparate datasets—a capability absent in existing approaches. The method transforms absolute values into a unified 0 to 100 scale through a hierarchical computation of control points, derived from mean values within data distribution intervals. This ensures inherent adaptability to the specific shape of any source dataset. In contrast to percentages, which merely represent a position within a fixed range, AMIS defines a value's position relative to the actual statistical distribution, all while preserving the rigorous properties of an interval scale. We demonstrate the method's practical efficacy through two real-world case studies: eliminating aggregation errors when averaging student grades across different subjects, and constructing a robust scale for the heavily skewed global GDP distribution. The results confirm that after AMIS normalization, heterogeneous data become directly comparable and suitable for correct computation of averages and weighted indices. The proposed approach holds substantial promise for a wide range of applications, including interdisciplinary research, big data analytics, and machine learning, offering a fundamentally new pathway for integrating heterogeneous metrics into a coherent measurement system.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uf62j_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uf62j_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01032156662633743}, {"title": "Continental Genetic Ancestries as Predictors of Socioeconomic and Cognitive Variation Across the Americas", "authors": "John Fuerst, Emil Ole William Kirkegaard", "abstract": "We draw upon newly compiled subnational indicators from fifteen countries to revisit relationships between continental genetic ancestry, cognitive ability (CA), and socioeconomic outcomes (S) in the Americas.

In three successive elections, white workers in the US voted for Donald Trump, many hoping that he would deport immigrant workers who were “taking their jobs.” A century earlier, US labor unions regularly disparaged and excluded Black and Asian workers from their ranks and later berated them as strikebreakers. In anti-oppression movements globally, infighting and backstabbing are rampant: western leftist coalitions have been coopted and pacified by centrist party machines while the center of mainstream politics shifts sharply to the right; Third World revolutions have given way to despotic postcolonial governments that punch down at indigenous people, racial/ethnic minorities, women, and queer people; and once-victims of genocide have today become perpetrators. Why is it so hard for oppressed peoples to come together in solidarity and sustain movements for change? What role do oppressed groups play in oppressing others, and what role can we all play in bringing forth emancipatory political alternatives? Questions like these have been raised by social psychologists and Marxist organizers, black feminists and social movement theorists. Answers, however, too often fail to make connections across academic literatures and levels of analysis. Some blame capitalist ideology, while others blame material conditions, and still others point to psychological predispositions. Erich Fromm, I argue, offers a way out of the impasse. More than most, Fromm explored why and how people act contrary to rational self-interest. Why did the German masses choose Nazism over Marxian class solidarity? Why did the US populace allow itself to be taken in by mediocre consumerism? To answer both questions, Fromm suggests that our fundamental human need for relatedness leads us to seek social acceptance by conforming to the dominant character of our society. Individual personalities are brought into alignment with the wider character structure by way of social filters that inculcate some traits and suppress others. Unhealthy societies tend to produce similarly unhealthy relational patterns, which Fromm terms socially-patterned defects, while repressing more productive orientations. Putting Fromm—and those he influenced, like Paulo Freire and bell hooks—into conversation with Marx, Foucault, Collins, and others, I develop a model of complicity of the oppressed wherein marginalized people seek to elevate themselves by cooperating in the oppression of others. Insofar as capitalism fosters competition and filters out solidaristic tendencies, marginalized people tend to choose narrow self-advancement over broad movements for change. Complicity of the oppressed is a socially-patterned defect, a byproduct of intersecting oppressions that turn people against one another.

We investigate young people’s first major transition from school-to-work. We accomplish this by studying a young person’s transitionary pathway at age 16 – to stay on within education or to leave it. This paper compares five birth cohorts that range from 1974-2013 to investigate the longitudinal comparisons of young people’s first transition to adulthood. We find evidence of remarkable social change across British youth. Historically, a young person’s first transition was characterised as a heavily stratified transitionary experience that saw individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds less likely to stay within education. Time has degraded these stratifying influences. Social inequalities such as sex, housing tenure, and social class have continued to decline in their influence during this period of transition. Educational Attainment has continued to have an effect – though it has weakened severely. The single largest impact on a young person staying on within education is now the cohort in which they are born in. Our paper has for the first time extended the investigation of youth across the entire mid-20th century using longitudinal social survey data.

Exploring how political orientation relates to childbearing can improve the understanding of the role values play in contemporary fertility patterns.

This study examines how multiple dimensions of political orientation relate to the achieved number of children among individuals aged 40-79 in 16 Western European countries, using data from round 9 of the European Social Survey (collected in 2018-2020). A significant positive association between right-leaning self-placement on the left/right scale and fertility is found in Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands, and Spain, whereas the association is non-significant in the other 12 countries. Social conservatism is positively associated with fertility in most countries, whereas economic egalitarianism, immigrant hostility, and pro-environmentalism are, in most cases, not significantly related to fertility. The strongest associations between party preference and fertility appear in Finland and Spain, where voters for right-wing parties tend to have more children than voters for left-wing parties. In half of the examined countries, voters for conservative or Christian democratic parties have significantly more children than voters from at least one leftist or liberal/centrist party family. However, several countries show no significant fertility differences by party preference. Overall, the findings highlight substantial variation in the relationship between political orientation and fertility, across countries and across different dimensions of political and value orientation.

Recent debates on parental age and offspring outcomes suggest that this analytical distinction is harder to make than it may seem, and that existing analyses attempting this do not resolve the identification problem. The problem is that any serious attempt to address confounding must condition on parents’ birth year, which makes parental age at birth and child birth year perfectly collinear. I contribute to these debates in two ways. First, I formalize a general mechanism: under flexible, nonparametric specifications, the joint effect of two linearly dependent dimensions is mechanically reallocated in favor of the relatively more finely measured dimension, while their idiosyncratic effects remain unidentified. Using NLSY79 Child and Young Adult Survey (NLSY-CY), I illustrate this mechanism focusing on children’s educational attainment in early adulthood. Second, I recast parental-age analyses based on the Generations and Gender Survey as an age-period-cohort-type identification problem and adapt Fosse and Winship’s recently developed bounding approach to obtain partial but transparent identification of parental-age and child–birth-year effects on educational outcomes in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden. Across a wide range of plausible assumptions, child-birth-year effects are non-trivial but cannot convincingly account for the key features of parenthood-age gradients, particularly the net advantages of later parenthood.

Using natural language processing, we extract sentiment from tweets, linking them to demographic and socioeconomic characteristics at the district level. Our analysis reveals stark geographical divides: anti-migration sentiment is more prevalent in areas that are older, less diverse and with lower rates of higher education. We find an intensification of polarisation after the 2016 Brexit referendum, with rises in both pro- and anti-migration expression and identify short-term fluctuations in sentiment corresponding to real-world events. Contrary to group threat theory, we find no association between short-term migration and negative sentiment. Instead, long-term demographic factors – particularly the presence of migrants – are positively associated with sentiment, supporting contact-based explanations.

By triangulating two quasi-experimental approaches: Children-of-Twins design (CoT) and adoption design, this study assesses the educational penalties of parental partnership dissolution in Norway. Administrative population registers are used to identify adoptees and a matched sample of non-adopted peers. For the CoT-design, these data are linked to the Norwegian Twin Registry, which includes adult twin pairs and their offspring. Both analyses rely on child cohorts born between 1986 and 2006. The CoT-design compares educational outcomes of offspring of twins, exploiting variation in dissolution within and between twin pairs, while the adoption analysis compares the association in adoptees versus a matched sample of non-adopted peers. Two key educational outcomes are analyzed: grade point average (GPA) at the end of compulsory schooling and high school completion. Results from CoT analyses show that parental dissolution is negatively associated with both GPA and high school completion. Yet, the association attenuates once shared family background and genetic factors are accounted for. The adoption design similarly shows a negative association for both adoptees and non-adoptees, but the notably weaker association among adoptees indicates that genetic confounding partly underlies the observed link.

David Hacker", "abstract": "This article revisits the Patriarchy Index (PI) a decade after its introduction, extending its scope to the United States around 1900 and situating it within the broader North Atlantic demographic regime. Using harmonized census microdata from IPUMS USA, NAPP, and Mosaic, we estimate PI values for the 1880 and 1910 U.S. censuses and compare them with contemporaneous European populations. The study provides the first systematic spatial mapping of family-based patriarchy in the United States, disaggregated by race and region, and identifies clusters and anomalies through spatial autocorrelation. Results show that U.S. counties at the turn of the twentieth century generally exhibited low levels of family patriarchy, with most values falling within the “low” range defined by earlier research. Yet beneath this pattern, significant internal variation emerges. Certain regions display PI values consistent with the Northwestern European model of weak family structure, while others—especially the South and West—register markedly higher scores, approaching those of Southeastern and Eastern Europe. Racial disaggregation reveals divergent trajectories: white households in parts of the South show moderately elevated PI values, whereas Black households tend to display lower scores, underscoring distinct family-driven gender dynamics. By 1910, the overall trajectory was one of depatriarchalization, with high-PI zones retreating and low values consolidating across most regions. These findings complicate the assumption that the Northwestern European model was simply transplanted into the United States. American regional profiles position themselves between the lower tails of Eastern European values and those of Ireland and Central Europe, while remaining distinct from the “core” North Atlantic populations. Rather than a straightforward transatlantic transfer, the U.S. family system appears as a composite formation: selectively receptive to Northwestern European norms in some regions, while retaining or intensifying patriarchal structures in others. The study underscores both the utility and the limitations of the PI framework. While effective in capturing family-based patriarchal structures in the period under investigation, the index becomes relatively insensitive once very low levels are reached and may not adequately reflect twentieth-century transformations. Future research should supplement the PI at least with dimensions of male and female wage labor to provide a more nuanced account of long-term depatriarchalization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9hw4_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/e9hw4_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.018564950256301338}, {"title": "When Autocracies Dominate International Organizations: Evidence from the UN Committee on NGOs", "authors": "Christoph Steinert", "abstract": "Scholars have documented a global trend toward autocratization and demonstrated that autocracies increasingly use their influence to shape decisions in international organizations (IOs).

The study leverages evidence from two original datasets on the decisions of the UN Committee on NGOs between 1998 and 2024 to test whether the theorized conditions linked to autocratic influence can translate into autocratic dominance in practice. Multi-pronged evidence demonstrates that autocracies have effectively seized the UN Committee on NGOs and exploit it to systematically defer and reject the applications of liberal NGOs.

Racial aphasia (difficulty speaking meaningfully about race) and colonial unknowing (actively sustained ignorance of the historical and contemporary entanglements of colonialism and racism) provide vital lenses for investigating the power and persistence of racialized hierarchies in the refugee regime.

While these interventions consistently generate initial enthusiasm, meta-analyses reveal that behavioral effects typically diminish beyond three months, with changes rarely persisting after interventions conclude. This pattern contrasts markedly with games' demonstrable cultural influence as evident in community formation, identity development, and sustained engagement over years or decades. We propose that this discrepancy reflects fundamental theoretical inadequacies in how behavioral interventions conceptualize games' influence on human behavior. Drawing on converging evidence from cultural economics, computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and game studies, we develop a framework that reconceptualizes gameplay as cultural meaning-making rather than behavioral conditioning. The framework articulates how sustainable behavioral transformation emerges through dynamic interactions between four interrelated dimensions: games as designed cultural artifacts, play as evolved behavioral disposition, gameplay as situated embodied experience, and re-play as reflective cultural practice. Situating this framework within active inference and free energy principle perspectives provides computational precision to these meaning-making processes, whereas cognitive gadget theory illuminates how play serves as a foundational environment for constructing distinctively human cognitive capacities. Central to our analysis is what we term the ludic dilemma, a tension between play's intrinsically motivated, autotelic nature and attempts to instrumentalize it for predetermined behavioral outcomes. We suggest that this tension helps explain the persistent failures of mechanistic interventions while pointing toward alternative approaches that preserve play's essential qualities and enable behavioral transformation through extended cultural processes.

Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare \"mega-trades\" and shipments with commercially unusual price per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in \"mega-trades\" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act.

Abstract Objective well-being is closely tied to the fulfillment of fundamental social rights including food, health, education, and housing. This paper examines the relationship between social policy and well-being in Mexico, focusing on how social rights translate into public policy mechanisms. We argue that objective well-being can be assessed through a conceptual framework linking needs, rights, and social policy. We develop a quantitative instrument to evaluate social rights fulfillment and its impact on objective well-being, enabling analysis of public policy performance across multiple dimensions. Findings reveal that despite some progress, Mexican social policy remains characterized by structural fragmentation that constrains effectiveness and generates inequities in access to basic rights. This results in heterogeneous rights fulfillment reflected in partial and insufficient well-being levels across the population, particularly affecting vulnerable groups who face systematic barriers to accessing adequate services and protections.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/59e6m_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/59e6m_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.16266466196020446}, {"title": "CoARA by numbers: Research assessment reform uptake in European higher education", "authors": "Janne Pölönen, Alexander Rushforth", "abstract": "Background: Several international initiatives have emerged to advocate for ‘responsible research assessment’ - practices that “incentivise, reflect and reward the plural characteristics of high-quality research, in support of diverse and inclusive research cultures” (Curry et al., 2020). In 2022, the Agreement on Reforming Research Assessment established 10 commitments and a 5-year action plan for organisational reforms. Aims: Higher education institutions are key implementation actors of the ARRA reforms as they conduct hiring decisions, manage promotions, and set reward structures that directly shape researcher incentives. This study provides a systematic empirical assessment of European higher education institutions’ participation in the Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) and develops a replicable monitoring framework for voluntary research assessment reform initiatives. Methods: We merged data from CoARA (signatories retrieved 5 August 2025), the European Tertiary Education Register (ETER), and other publicly available data sources, covering 3,439 European HEIs across 40 countries. Using quantitative analysis, we mapped participation patterns across institutional characteristics and countries, and examined associations between CoARA and other reform initiatives. Findings: 450 European HEIs (13%) have signed CoARA, with uptake concentrated among PhD-awarding (27%) and research-intensive universities (52% of those in the Leiden Ranking). Geographic asymmetries are apparent, with stronger uptake in Western and Northern Europe and so far lower signatory numbers in several Eastern European and Widening countries. CoARA signatories are statistically more likely to have also signed the parallel reform initiatives DORA, HR Excellence, and EQAR audits. Across all four initiatives, 36% of institutions signed at least one, with 14% participating in multiple initiatives. Meta-organizations such as university networks and European University alliances show substantially higher participation rates. Conclusion: Our merged dataset and monitoring framework provide an important foundation for tracking reform momentum over time. It helps to show that in a relatively short time period, CoARA has gained substantial uptake among research-intensive European HEIs where assessment pressures are arguably most acute, and lower engagement in teaching-oriented institutions and several Eastern European systems. It also suggests CoARA operates within a broader reform ecosystem, with institutions often signing more than one complementary initiatives (DORA, HR Excellence, EQAR audits). Meta-organizations appear to play an important role in enhancing participation among institutional peer groups.

However, peer support programs have historically struggled to reach families whose experiences of disability intersect with additional diverse identities, such as Indigenous, newcomer, and LGBTQ2S+ families. These groups often face distinct cultural, linguistic, and systemic barriers that shape how, when, and whether peer support feels accessible or relevant. Despite growing recognition of these disparities, there remains limited empirical guidance on how community organizations can embed inclusivity and cultural safety across their structures and practices. Objectives: This study examined how the Family Support Institute of British Columbia (FSI)—a peer-based nonprofit—operationalizes inclusion and cultural responsiveness within its policies, staffing, and relationships. The research addressed three questions: (1) How does FSI identify and respond to inequities in access to peer support across communities with intersecting sociocultural identities? (2) How do its practices align with community-identified needs? (3) What opportunities exist to expand the reach and relevance of its support? Methods: A descriptive single-case study design integrated semi-structured interviews (n = 12) with FSI staff, board members, and Indigenous Advisory Circle representatives, alongside document review of strategic and policy materials. Reflexive thematic analysis guided data interpretation, supported by community-engaged validation and member checking. Results: Four themes captured how FSI advances inclusivity: (1) addressing barriers to equitable peer support, (2) building culturally safe and inclusive support, (3) organizational strategies and change processes, and (4) evidencing early cultural and structural shifts in engagement and impact. Initiatives such as creating an Indigenous Practice Advisor role, Indigenous Advisory Circle, and culturally responsive staff role re-alignment exemplify systemic rather than separate additive approaches to equity. Conclusions: FSI’s experience highlights how community-based organizations can translate reconciliation and equity principles into everyday practice. Sustained relationship-building, Indigenous mentorship, and flexible resource allocation were key drivers of trust and inclusion. Embedding these principles across organizational systems offers a promising pathway to dismantle structural barriers and strengthen culturally safe supports for all families.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k8jzu_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/k8jzu_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00887245607380649}, {"title": "Examining the Multidimensional Structure of Subjective Well-Being: Evidence from Mexico", "authors": "Carlos Alberto Arellano-Esparza", "abstract": "Most research on subjective well-being (SWB) relies on the classic tripartite model encompassing life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect.

While there has been much criticism of these interventions, largely from the qualitative research community, we want to draw attention to a troubling trend in the promotion of open science: the leaking of standards relevant only to quantitative research to all paradigms. Or, as others refer to it, “positivism creep”. Here, we situate positivism creep (i.e., the creeping of positivist conventions to all research) within research policy, we highlight its increasing prevalence within open science reforms, and we warn against a future which could alienate many non-positivist scholars. We argue that the primary framing of open science as the pursuit of reproducibility and objectivity risks promoting positivism creep in the social sciences and humanities.

Usually involving both public and private parties without clear hierarchies, local implementation of policy is a process of multi-stakeholder governance and often characterized by difficult collective decision-making due to different perceptions of challenges and priorities. A good example of this process is energy and heat planning, which involves several local stakeholders with different hierarchical structures. In this paper, we study the evaluation of challenges and success factors among municipalities and utilities in the context of heat planning in Germany. Based on a survey of 267 communal stakeholders, we find an effect of inversion in juxtaposing importance and difficulty ratings: While municipalities perceive factors such as effective communication, clearly defined responsibilities and concrete measures and projects as more important than their utility counterparts, utilities see them as more challenging. Such perceptual inversion has the potential to complicate collective goal-setting and decision-making and thus can slow down energy transition governance processes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pagvs_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/pagvs_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01925053743822125}, {"title": "Posthumanist intercultural multilingualism research: Culture as relations and as meanings in an overall meaning-making space", "authors": "Dominic Busch", "abstract": "For linguistic subdisciplines focusing on language practice like sociolinguistics and pragmatics, the fields of multilingualism research and intercultural communication for long have been conceptual bridges from language to the social world whereby both concepts often have been perceived as competing.

Its emergence, construction, presence, and transformation have long preoccupied philosophical inquiry. This paper examines the epistemological and ontological disintegration characteristic of late modernity, which is a condition in which the mediations that once sustained meaning and subjectivity lose coherence. We refer to this condition as the Symbolic Crisis: a rupture in the symbolic order's mediating function that fractures relationality at both the ontological and structural levels. The crisis appears in phenomena such as the erosion of trust, the weakening of shared meaning, and the growing separation between lived relation and symbolic representation. Our intervention centers on two concepts: relationality and generative presence. We introduce these as theoretical orientations: relationality provides an ontological foundation through which existence becomes apprehensible beyond the limits of symbolic articulation. Generative presence describes the epistemic and phenomenological process through which relational being becomes active in lived experience, even as the metaphysical subject remains structurally open. Through presence, relational beings bring forth meaning and allow existence to manifest within concrete situations. Within this framework, law and justice appear as forms of symbolic mediation whose force emerges from the interplay between formal structures and the generativity expressed in interpretive and practical engagement. These structures, however, cannot address the Symbolic Crisis on their own, because the crisis originates in the widening separation between being and its mediation. The juridical movement reorients justice toward relational being and the ongoing processes through which its authority and meaning are produced and sustained. The extra juridical movement cultivates the formation and expressive realization of generative presence within relational existence. Together, these movements offer a pathway for reapproaching the subject and for restoring the resonance between being and meaning under contemporary conditions of symbolic fragmentation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q3ecy_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/q3ecy_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00701911035407321}, {"title": "Transitions to low carbon social futures: Achieving net zero aviation in UK Higher Education:", "authors": "Paul Chatterton, Noah Birksted-Breen", "abstract": "As part of broader societal shifts to net-zero, this study aims to determine the effectiveness, limitations and impacts, of voluntary individual action in the transition to net zero aviation in the UK Higher Education (HE) sector.

The Area of Special Control of Advertisements (ASCA) powers in the English planning system allow local authorities the legal capacity to prohibit almost all forms of outdoor advertising within a designated zone, thereby restricting corporate use of urban public space for profit. Using documents from a national census of local authorities, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of ASCA reviews which reveals how this right to the city is discursively sacrificed. We develop the concept of discursive contraction to describe the ways planning discourse recruits yet restricts the range of legitimate actors, meanings, and outcomes associated with public space regulation. Three discursive practices underpin the contraction that, in this case, delegitimizes, forecloses, and subsumes civic reservations: 1) invisible actors, active documents 2) consistency as a governing logic and 3) the urbanisation growth assumption.

After collecting data in Tonga and Salt Lake City, Utah, we produced identity maps to evaluate expectations regarding how Tongan identity shifts across cultural boundaries. Supporting formal theory, a greater number of labels were ascribed in the larger, more complex U.S. population where ethnic labels were also more salient. For Tongan in-group observers, gender, age, and wealth were the most salient identity groups with strong interdependencies, whereas U.S. out-group respondents used a wide variety of categories including wealth, age, ethnicity, but downplayed gender.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ufds8_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ufds8_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.41158826845674934}, {"title": "Language shift in Vanuatu’s 2020 census: Investigation of a national dataset for 250,000 people", "authors": "Guy A. Lavender Forsyth", "abstract": "Growing concern surrounds the threats faced by Vanuatu’s famous diversity of Indigenous languages, with particular attention directed towards the pressure that Bislama exerts as the country’s lingua franca. Here, I report the results of exploratory analyses of Vanuatu’s most recent national census, leveraging individual-level data for nearly 250,000 people to gauge the magnitude of the shift away from Indigenous languages and identify the factors implicated in this process. The data reveal that 83.9% of Vanuatu’s population can ‘easily’ speak an Indigenous language and that 74.9% learnt an Indigenous first language. Conversely, 9.6% of people cannot speak an Indigenous language (including 9.4% of Indigenous Ni-Vanuatu), and a severely conservatively-biased estimate shows that Bislama is the first language learnt for at least 14.2% of the population, including 14.3% of Ni-Vanuatu, with the true figure likely closer to 25%. The youngest generations show considerably poorer Indigenous language abilities and substantially greater learning of Bislama as a first language, a pattern consistent with a movement away from Indigenous languages over time. Further patterns that emerge indicate that Indigenous languages fare best in Vanuatu’s rural areas, in the Area Councils with the smallest populations, and in the communities that are the least diverse in terms of people’s island backgrounds. Focusing in on these rural areas, where Bislama likely poses the greatest threat to Indigenous languages, individuals who have a history of migration, who have access to modern communication technologies, who live in economically better-off households, and who live in households without kastom land tenure are less likely to speak an Indigenous language easily and are more likely to learn Bislama as a first language. While strictly correlational and non-causal, these exploratory analyses reflect both the vitality of Indigenous languages in Vanuatu today and the serious challenges they face from a suite of likely interconnected factors.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vjyng_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vjyng_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.293106511733945}]
