[{"title": "To fight or to govern? Political capital and electoral competition", "authors": "Catherine Hafer, Scott A. Tyson, Congyi Zhou", "abstract": "We examine the endogenous development of specialized political capital and its use, by both governing and opposition parties, within a model of policymaking and electoral competition. The opposition party can use political capital to impede the governing party's policy agenda—to throw sand in the gears—but may make itself less electorally desirable in the process. We characterize conditions that give rise to different equilibrium patterns of political capital, including, among others, entrenched parties. Our results suggest that, in the special circumstances in which they arise, entrenched parties offer the voter a silver lining: In these cases, the incumbent and opposition parties have acquired different specialized political capital, and voters benefit from the opposition's developed capacity to curb the governing party's excesses. Due to the underlying conditions, policy outcomes are still poor, but, under relevant conditions, party entrenchment mitigates them, rather than exacerbating them as conventionally supposed.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70030", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70030", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008153313866164136}, {"title": "The policy adjacent: How affordable housing generates policy feedback among neighboring residents", "authors": "Michael Hankinson, Asya Magazinnik, Melissa Sands", "abstract": "While scholars have documented feedback effects among a policy's direct winners and losers, less is known about whether such effects can occur among the indirectly affected—“the policy adjacent.” Using 458 geocoded housing developments built between two nearly identical statewide ballot propositions funding affordable housing in California, we show that policy generates feedback effects among neighboring residents in systematic ways. New, nearby affordable housing causes majority‐homeowner blocks to increase their support for the housing bond, while majority‐renter blocks decrease or do not change their support. We attribute the positive effect among majority‐homeowner blocks to the housing's replacement of blight. In contrast, the lack of a positive effect among majority‐renter blocks may be driven by the threat of gentrification.

To adjudicate between these claims, we compile public opinion surveys across 24 countries containing over 17,000 respondents.

More decisive races, in which small performance leads produce larger probabilities of victory, are usually more dangerous. In addition, revealing information about rivals’ capabilities has two opposing effects on risk: states discover either that they are far apart in capability and compete less or that they are close in capability and drastically reduce safety to win.

Our analysis shows that all political parties, regardless of type or ideology, engage with the non-electoral field, showing a greater tendency to express support for protests they agree with, rather than to criticize those they oppose, in their social media posts. Moreover, our findings underscore a robust association between party support or criticism of a protest and the likelihood of its voters either participating in or shunning the same protest.

Using an event study design to analyze constitutional changes in 171 countries between 1951 and 2020, we find that new constitutions lead to durable improvements in constitutional compliance in democracies. The effect of constitutional change in nondemocracies, however, is small and short-lived.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01364-4", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01364-4", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005046427629143535}, {"title": "How Sexuality Affects Evaluations of Immigrant Deservingness and Cultural Similarity: A Conjoint Survey Experiment", "authors": "Nathan I Hoffmann, Kristopher Velasco", "abstract": "In the wake of significant increases in lesbian and gay (LG) immigration, do Americans view LG migrants as more deserving of entry to the United States than their straight counterparts? Using a conjoint survey experiment with 1,650 respondents, we investigate how potential immigrants’ sexual-minority status affects Americans’ perceptions of their deservingness for admission and their cultural similarity to the United States. Results show that, overall, Americans do not perceive LG immigrants as more deserving than straight ones, and LG immigrants are perceived as less culturally similar. But results also reveal heterogeneity: LG immigrants fleeing persecution are seen as more deserving of admission, and Democrats, atheists, and LG respondents consider LG migrants more deserving than straight ones. This paper helps disentangle Americans’ preferences for migrants’ presumed cultural similarity from economic potential and humanitarian merit as well as sheds light on public opinion of an understudied but politically salient group.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf054", "doi": "10.1093/poq/nfaf054", "journal_full": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9965304060126629}, {"title": "The Partisan Effects of News Coverage Highlighting Inclusion in Congress", "authors": "Lauren P Olson, Nicole Huffman, Romeo A Gray", "abstract": "Abstract505 After US elections, news stories frequently highlight how the US Congress has a higher proportion of women and is more racially and ethnically diverse than at any point in history. While some literature suggests that this coverage may diminish legitimacy and support for democratic norms, other research suggests that as descriptive representation increases, citizens—including white people and men—have more trust in their institutions and perceive them to be more legitimate. However, little is known about the effect of this type of news coverage on citizens’ attitudes toward Congress and democracy as a whole. Given these competing expectations, we conduct a series of experiments to determine how portrayals of a diverse Congress affect its perceived legitimacy and support for democratic norms related to Congress’s power. We hypothesize that as Congress diversifies faster than the executive branch, the motivation to protect traditional hierarchies will undermine both the perceived legitimacy of Congress and the commitment to democratic restraints on presidential power among white people and men. Our results are mixed. Based on two survey experiments with nationally representative samples, we find that Democrats perceive Congress as having more institutional legitimacy when informed of its diversity, while Republicans show no difference in their legitimacy perceptions when compared to control conditions. Furthermore, we find no evidence that information about Congress’s diversity decreases support for democratic norms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf050", "doi": "10.1093/poq/nfaf050", "journal_full": "Public Opinion Quarterly", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.13323600524575419}, {"title": "Campaign Contributions, Reciprocity, and Gender Solidarity", "authors": "Christian Fong, Joshua McCrain, Catherine Wineinger", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1086/740167", "doi": "10.1086/740167", "journal_full": "The Journal of Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01665155859165146}, {"title": "Shaping the Bench: The Effect of Ideology and Influence on Judicial Reappointments", "authors": "Silje Synnøve Lyder Hermansen, Daniel Naurin", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1086/740169", "doi": "10.1086/740169", "journal_full": "The Journal of Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008646266175252326}, {"title": "Financial Sanction Spillovers and Firm Interdependence", "authors": "Lorenzo Crippa, Nikhil Kalyanpur, Abraham Newman", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1086/740171", "doi": "10.1086/740171", "journal_full": "The Journal of Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010971560576665262}, {"title": "Same old, same old?

Drawing on governmentality theory and media studies, this piece examines how screentime discourse can position parents as primarily responsible for risks that are in part, produced by systems outside the home. Using the Australian policy reversal on YouTube as a case study, it highlights how inconsistent guidance can erode parental confidence and at times sustain cycles of shame and surveillance. Rather than consistently addressing structural factors such as platform design and algorithmic amplification, media and policy narratives displace responsibility onto families. The commentary argues for reframing of digital parenting as a relational practice embedded within sociotechnical systems, rather than a purely private moral challenge. It calls for clear, co-designed, and contextually relevant guidance developed collaboratively by platforms, educators, and public health bodies. By centring collective care and shared responsibility, the piece advocates moving beyond compliance-focussed directives towards frameworks that empower parents as partners in children’s digital wellbeing. In doing so, it invites broader reflection on how digital governance, media narratives, and health communication can more justly support families navigating complex digital environments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251400650", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251400650", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.003719527763071384}, {"title": "The Poverty of Moral Foundation Messaging", "authors": "Darren Hawkins, Christopher F.

By analyzing four prominent multimodal companions (AvatarOne, Digi, Paradot, and Replika), we argue that despite differences in architecture and style, state-of-the-art platforms converge on the following sociotechnical qualities: human-likeness, accessibility, customizability, and relationship progression. By creating technical affordances to augment these qualities, companion platforms ultimately project what we call a future of on-demand intimacy – intimacy that can be acquired in a truly frictionless manner. Beyond examining how commercial entities mobilize the grammar of human intimacy in tandem with on-demand culture to create new markets, this study offers a conceptual framework for future research into how platform dynamics shape not only the availability but also the meaning of intimacy in human–AI interactions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251410394", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251410394", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010781353688777306}, {"title": "Digital Ambiguous Loss and Incarceration: Multimodal Analysis of Image-Based Posts Among Gang-Affiliated Black Youth", "authors": "Aviv Y.

This is partly because the interpretative, nuanced human reading of text and coding that it requires is labour intensive and very time consuming. This paper presents a method to simplify and shorten the coding process by extending a small sample of interpretative human-annotated interviews to a larger, representative, sample using supervised natural language processing. We extensively assess the robustness and reliability of this approach to show when and how it adds value, including an analysis of how many human-annotated documents are optimal for a budget constrained researcher. We apply this approach to analyse 2,200 open-ended interviews on parent’s aspirations for children with Rohingya refugees and their Bangladeshi hosts. We show that studying aspirations with open-ended interviews extends the economics focus on material goals to ideas from philosophy and anthropology that emphasize aspirations for moral and religious values, and the navigational capacity to achieve these aspirations. This approach allows us to identify several novel results including a new type of migrant selection; we show that Rohingya refugees are negatively selected on education but positively selected on navigational capacity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueag005", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueag005", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03454218649052254}, {"title": "Institutions under Pressure: The Effect of Community Groups on Forest Preservation after a Natural Disaster", "authors": "Prakash Pathak, Matthias Schündeln", "abstract": "We analyse the resilience of community-based institutions to large shocks.

Using a triple difference strategy, we show that the earthquake-induced increase in deforestation is significantly lower in locations with a higher share of forest covered by forest user groups. Thus, these institutions lead to more sustainable use of forests when they are under pressure.

We show that subjects’ behavior in a laboratory experiment is consistent with the predictions of our model, and present evidence against alternative coordination mechanisms.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaf068", "doi": "10.1093/jeea/jvaf068", "journal_full": "Journal of the European Economic Association", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0051982313549306935}, {"title": "Changing Opportunity: Sociological Mechanisms Underlying Growing Class Gaps and Shrinking Race Gaps in Economic Mobility", "authors": "Raj Chetty, Will Dobbie, Benjamin Goldman, Sonya R Porter, Crystal S Yang", "abstract": "We show that intergenerational mobility changed rapidly by race and class in recent decades in the U.S. and study the causal mechanisms underlying those changes.

Earnings increased for Black children at all parental income levels, reducing white-Black earnings gaps for children from low-income families by 30%. Class gaps grew and race gaps shrank similarly for non-monetary outcomes such as educational attainment, standardized test scores, and mortality rates. Using a quasi-experimental design, we show that the divergent trends in economic mobility were caused by differential changes in childhood environments, as proxied by parental employment rates, within local communities defined by race, class, and childhood county. Outcomes improve across birth cohorts for children who grow up in communities with increasing parental employment rates, with larger effects for children who move to such communities at younger ages. Children’s outcomes are most strongly related to the parental employment rates of peers they are more likely to interact with, such as those in their own birth cohort, suggesting that the relationship between children’s outcomes and parental employment rates is mediated by social interaction.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf057", "doi": "10.1093/qje/qjaf057", "journal_full": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01044370541209838}, {"title": "A multi-level puzzle: contextual determinants of the discrimination paradox in Europe", "authors": "Ben van Enk, Özge Bilgili", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00516-1", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00516-1", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.5760501392526529}, {"title": "Deskilling and labour market barriers among skilled racialized immigrants in British Columbia: a mixed-methods study", "authors": "Karun Kishor Karki", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00504-5", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00504-5", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9903243775010451}, {"title": "Red tape and racialized legal status: how Boston’s migrant health safety net unraveled", "authors": "Vilna Bashi", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2600088", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2600088", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.978487068992949}, {"title": "“ … they can change their mind about anything”: temporality, citizenship, belonging and the Windrush Scandal", "authors": "Kalwinder Kaur Sandhu", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2601343", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2601343", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.4687107845255044}, {"title": "A wide net of solidarity: antiracism and anti-imperialism from the Americas to the globe", "authors": "Anima Adjepong", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2608929", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2608929", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.2895853820776898}, {"title": "Creating a topological home through radically hopeful undoings", "authors": "Kirsi Pauliina Kallio", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2601340", "doi": "10.1080/01419870.2025.2601340", "journal_full": "Ethnic and Racial Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011324941875568095}, {"title": "Cumulative disadvantage and perceptions of unfair treatment", "authors": "Clifford L.

Estimating Inflows of Overstayers in the Schengen Area Using Air Passenger Records and Facebook Mobility Data", "authors": "Ettore Recchi, Luca Bernasconi, Alejandra Rodriguez Sanchez", "abstract": "Overstayers—travellers entering a country with a valid visa but staying beyond the initially authorised period—are a blind spot of migration research. Past studies claim that overstaying is indeed the main gateway to irregular migration in Europe, but few estimates exist. This paper explores three new methods to estimate the inflows of overstayers. We concentrate on the Schengen area as destination, given its relevance in global migration flows, and on non‐European countries as origins, since for travellers from these countries commercial flights are the most likely transportation mode to Europe. Our methods rely on aggregate information on incoming and departing passengers from all airports in the Schengen Area, and on Facebook users' mobility data. In the first method, we compute ‘net air travel flows’ as the difference between incoming and outgoing passengers; we then deduce net regular migration (using data from Eurostat and the QuantMig project) from ‘net air travel flows’ to obtain ‘unaccounted net flows’, which we hold to equate approximately to newly incoming overstayers with short‐stay visas for 2019. In the second method, building on the first estimate, we employ the logic of gravity models to project estimates for later years. In the third method, we build on the intuitions of the first method but use net migration figures from data on Facebook users' cross‐border movements. Substantively, the results of the different methods converge, indicating around 450,000 new overstayers who entered the whole of the Schengen Area in 2019 with short‐stay visas. Analyses for the following years obtained with the second and third method match and are in line with changes in travel policies during the COVID‐19 pandemic (2020 and 2021), suggesting a significant reduction in the number of overstayers for those years and an uptick for the years 2022–2023. By uncovering the size and scope of the overstaying population we shed light on a highly contested issue in the public debate and ultimately contribute to raise awareness on the constructed nature of the ‘regular’ versus ‘irregular’ framing of migration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70123", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70123", "journal_full": "International Migration", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9541379419601396}, {"title": "Unauthorized Identity Craft: Rethinking “Fraud” in the Study of Migration", "authors": "Jaeeun Kim, Apostolos Andrikopoulos", "abstract": "Crafting identity is integral to the struggle of aspiring migrants to access the territory, labor market, and citizenship of desired destinations. Such practices are at times classified as “fraud.” Migration scholars should approach this state-centered category with caution. Such framing naturalizes the state's monopolistic claim to the truth of individual identities. It obscures the complex moral terrain migrants navigate. We propose “unauthorized identity craft” (UIC) as an alternative concept. UIC shifts our attention from migrants’ deception to their agency in the absence of state authorization — their learned craft to navigate, and at times subvert, restrictive mobility regimes. Drawing on long-term, multisited ethnographic research with Korean Chinese and West African migrants, we show that UIC is sustained by a complex web of relations, connecting documents, organizations, and people — state and non-state actors alike. The effectiveness of UIC depends on migrants’ intricate and intensive labor to create, maintain, and reshape this relational matrix. Our emphasis on UIC's relationality enables us to examine how migrants and other actors involved classify their relationships and the various forms of exchange that sustain them. Mismatches in these framings give rise to contestation and negotiation — important elements of the craft migrants must perform. Our relational perspective further helps explain UIC's temporal dynamic. For some migrants, UIC remains ephemeral, a form of strategic masking; for others, it generates lasting entanglements, moral dilemmas, and enduring identity shifts. We show that UIC's long-term ramifications are shaped by the breadth, density, durability, and consequentiality of the relational matrix that sustains UIC.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251409752", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251409752", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9789970238624944}, {"title": "Workplace Arrangement and Language Acquisition of Immigrants", "authors": "Yuyao Liu, Eric Fong", "abstract": "Flexible workplace arrangements (FWA), particularly working from home and working without fixed workplaces, have become increasingly prevalent worldwide.

Using data from the 2016 and 2021 Population Census conducted by the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong SAR, we compare immigrant workers under three workplace arrangements: on-site, working without a fixed workplace, and working from home. Our findings reveal a strong and positive relationship between work without a fixed workplace and immigrants’ proficiency in Cantonese, the local language of Hong Kong. This relationship is consistent across immigrants with varying durations of stay and those who migrated before or after adulthood. Instrumental variable regressions, causal mediation analysis and placebo tests further suggest that this relationship is likely causal.

However, while experimental research suggests CAL can enhance student outcomes, such findings often rely on experimental conditions not easily replicated in ordinary classroom settings (e.g., opt-in participation, extensive training and support, and high CAL usage targets). To assess the real-world impact of CAL, we draw on a large three-year panel of administrative data covering over 200,000 students in school districts that licensed Khan Academy’s Measures of Academic Progress accelerator, a program designed to support math learning. To identify causal effects, we exploit within-teacher and within-school changes in average classroom CAL practice time—a strategy that yields precise, policy-relevant estimates even at modest usage levels. We find that a classroom with 6.6 h of annual Khan Academy practice (about 11 min per week) experiences a + 0.031 SD gain in math test score performance compared to no practice.

Reddit’s r/place experiment, a large-scale social game, provides a unique opportunity to test these signals consistently across thousands of subsystems undergoing critical transitions. In r/place, millions of users collaboratively created “compositions”, or pixel-art drawings, in which transitions occur when one composition rapidly replaces another. We develop a machine-learning-based early warning system that combines the predictive power of multiple system-specific time series via gradient-boosted decision trees with memory-retaining features. Our method significantly outperforms standard early warning indicators. Trained on the 2022 r/place data, our algorithm detects half of the transitions occurring within 20 min at a false positive rate of just 3.6%. Its performance remains robust when tested on the 2023 r/place event, demonstrating generalizability across different contexts. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for interpreting the predictions, we investigate the underlying drivers of warnings, which could be relevant to other complex systems, especially online social systems. We reveal an interplay of patterns preceding transitions, such as critical slowing down or speeding up, a lack of innovation or coordination, turbulent histories, and a lack of image complexity.

In both structures, the saccade-related potentials showed status-dependent amplitude modulation in specific frequency bands. In the amygdala, shifting gaze from lower- to higher-status individuals was associated with anticipatory power transients in the 20 to 25 Hz frequency band, whereas gaze shifts from higher- to lower-status individuals were marked by predominantly postsaccadic power transients. Following the gaze of the aggressive, dominant individual induced increased postsaccadic power in the gamma band in both the amygdala and hippocampus, with some variation in frequency depending on whether the saccade landed on the social partner or elsewhere.

This preregistered research examined cross-cultural variation in gender stereotypes based on public opinion poll data from 1995 (22 nations with 22,000 respondents) and 2023 (40 nations with 4,800 respondents). Results revealed that men were perceived as more agentic than women and women as more communal than men in all studied nations at both time points. Yet, substantial cross-cultural variation existed in the strength of these stereotypes whereby the communion stereotype in particular related to the distribution of women and men into social roles. The female advantage in communion was stronger the larger women’s share in the labor force and the greater the occupational sex segregation, both reflecting women’s employment primarily in communal domains. The male advantage in agency likely reflects that women’s considerable inroads into leader roles put them in versions of the role entailing lesser status and power and therefore conveying lesser agency. For competence, most respondents believed that women and men are equally competent in 17 of the 23 nations surveyed in 1995 and in all 40 nations surveyed in 2023.

Yet, a theory of culture with an associated measurement model providing the means to systematically study its effects has proven elusive. Developments in cognitive culture theory over the past several years provide a new perspective and a new set of tools. Culture can be conceptualized as a set of shared cognitive models that encode the information required for individuals to function in a given social setting. These cultural models can be elicited and examined in detail using the methods of cultural domain analysis, and the cultural consensus model (CCM) can be used to test for sharing and to describe variation in culture. Using the results of cultural consensus analysis as a foundation, cultural consonance can be measured for individuals. Cultural consonance is the degree to which individuals, in their own behaviors, approximate the prototypes for behavior encoded in cultural models. Cultural consonance thus extends cognitive culture theory to an examination of culture expressed in behavior.

Constitutional equality, affirmative action, and the expansion of public education weakened entrenched forms of exclusion and enabled segments of historically marginalised communities to attain limited upward mobility, securing entry into formal employment and the lower middle strata. Yet this advancement has not culminated in durable economic elevation or meaningful access to elite positions, exposing a persistent disjunction between juridical liberation and substantive class mobility. This paper interrogates the paradox of chains broken yet ladders blocked by examining the structural constraints that impede progression beyond the middle tiers. Drawing upon economic and sociological perspectives, it demonstrates how asymmetries in access to land, financial capital, elite educational institutions, and influential social networks continue to govern patterns of wealth accumulation and occupational stratification across generations. It further contends that post-liberalisation growth, while expansive in aggregate terms, has recalibrated inequality by disproportionately valorising inherited assets and entrenched forms of cultural capital. The study concludes that India’s development must be assessed not merely through growth metrics but through its capacity to institutionalise inclusive and intergenerational mobility.

This article problematises dominant explanations that centre great power competition, adopting instead a Gramscian approach that takes seriously the domestic and transnational sources of state authority. We argue that China’s national security turn is best understood as a Caesarist hegemonic project defined by charismatic leadership, arbitration between social groups, and coercive rule, rooted in global, state and societal conflicts inherent to global capitalism. Driven by crisis-prone conditions of escalating US-China rivalry, intra-state factional stalemates over China’s industrial overcapacity, and deepening societal inequality, the article demonstrates how a Xi Jinping-led national security faction has sought to recalibrate the Chinese hegemonic project. In this light, the national security turn is not wholly a response to inter-state security competition but also a means to further extract the latent growth potential from China’s development model and consolidate the position of Chinese state actors and of China between a US-led Global North and China-led Global South.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtw3p_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jtw3p_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.021841778378316024}, {"title": "Beneath the Surface: Measuring Hidden Indifference in Japanese Territorial Attitudes", "authors": "Takeru Eto", "abstract": "Japan is currently engaged in three major territorial disputes: the Northern Territories, Takeshima, and the Senkaku Islands.

Using AMEs from an ICT regression model, the results reveal substantial levels of hidden indifference: approximately 19% for Takeshima, 11% for the Senkaku Islands, and 5% for the Northern Territories. Crucially, this indifference is not randomly distributed but is systematically structured by socioeconomic and geographic factors. The analysis shows that indifference is significantly higher among individuals in precarious employment. Furthermore, residents of metropolitan areas, such as Tokyo and Kinki region, exhibit greater indifference toward Takeshima and the Senkaku Islands, while people in closer proximity to these territories tend to be more engaged. Interestingly, however, residents in Hokkaido, the region closest to the Northern Territories, exhibit higher latent indifference than the national average, potentially indicating a divergence between local pragmatic interests and national narratives.

Central to the analysis is Dr. B. R. Ambedkar’s constitutional vision, which redefined Indian democracy through the inseparable pursuit of social and economic justice. His transformative legal architecture not only dismantled exploitative land relations but also facilitated the emergence of an inclusive middle class across diverse sectors. Employing a historical-analytical methodology, this paper interrogates the transition from feudal dependency to constitutional empowerment by engaging with economic theory, constitutional provisions on equality, abolition of untouchability, and land reforms. By juxtaposing pre- and post-Constitutional realities, the research elucidates how juridical reform can function as an instrument of social emancipation and equitable redistribution. Ultimately, this study contributes to global discourses on agrarian justice by positioning India’s constitutional experience as a replicable model for reform, capable of addressing similar socio-economic inequities in other parts of the world.

A reportagem discute mecanismos explicativos da psicologia social e da comunicação – reciprocidade, viés de autoatendimento e third-person effect – e destaca a centralidade de refeições e pequenos brindes, com evidências de efeito dose–resposta, sugerindo que interações repetidas podem ampliar a receptividade às mensagens promocionais mesmo sem percepção consciente por parte dos médicos. Por fim, aborda o “currículo oculto” nas escolas médicas e argumenta que transparência e tetos para brindes são insuficientes, defendendo respostas estruturais: restrições mais firmes e modelos institucionais transparentes de financiamento, com governança independente, para proteger a integridade clínica, reduzir conflitos de interesse e preservar a confiança pública.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pcnse_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/pcnse_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.08120701733058278}, {"title": "Economic Conditions Constitute Zero-Sum Beliefs as a Predictive and Classifiable Cognitive Structure", "authors": "Sun Jingxuan, Li Changhao, Leng He, Abhishek Sheetal", "abstract": "The social competition has become increasingly fierce, and individuals’ perception of success is guided by cooperation and shared benefits.

This study aims to evaluate whether the zero-sum construal of success has a predictable structural basis shaped by macroeconomic and social-status factors.

In this paper, we propose a new answer to this longstanding question. Organizational researchers should embrace – and, in particular, cite – preprints in their theorizing. To underpin this proposal, we reconceptualize preprints as a liminal genre of scholarly communication that sits between peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed genres. Equipped with the unique characteristic of epistemic uncertainty, preprints offer researchers who embrace them new possibilities for rigorous theorizing. These new possibilities open up in particular for peripheral forms, such as interpretative or speculative theorizing, and thus support pluralism without interfering with the dominant forms of theorizing.

A recently proposed framework – the endogenous log-linear model (ELMo) – allows the statistical modelling of these social processes and, therefore, dependence in mobility, combining insights from exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and log-linear models. However, little attention was paid to how such models should be specified in a principled, theoretically informed way. In this study, we apply statistical theory to propose model specifications that can be used to analyse emergent structures in mobility.

Cross-sectional estimates using three sampling strategies were compared with longitudinal results via Bayesian multilevel regression with negative binomial specification. Findings reveal that longitudinal modeling produces more conservative and precise estimates, while cross-sectional methods tend to inflate effect sizes and interparty differences.

Our findings reveal distinct micro-class mobility patterns shaped by institutionalized “mobility corridors,” with concentrated mobility along specific origin-destination paths after accounting for big-class and gradational characteristics. These patterns are asymmetrical, with elevated mobility rates from micro-class A to B not reciprocated from B to A.

These socially shaped motivations influence how young adults approach the prospect of parenthood and ultimately shape their fertility intentions. Yet existing research lacks a theoretical framework that clarifies how social influences on motivation become the psychological mechanisms driving such intentions and subsequent behaviors. We address this gap by integrating Self-Determination Theory with the Theory of Planned Behavior, proposing that socio-cognitive factors - attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control - affect fertility intentions not directly but through the type of motivation they foster, whether intrinsic, extrinsic, or amotivated. Using nationally representative survey data on Italian young adults and structural equation modeling, we show that fertility intentions depend less on socio-cognitive factors themselves and more on the motivational orientations they generate. Intrinsic motives are associated with stronger intentions, whereas extrinsic and amotivated forms correspond to weaker or absent commitments.

In contrast to legends of late Bon introduction, we show that it was present in all five Nepalese regions by 1500 BCE: Kathmandu Valley, eastern and western hills, southern lowlands, and northern highlands. The data suggest a generative synthesis, a pragmatic \"ritual multiplex\" in which communities strategically code-switched between Kirat deep ontology and Bon's spirit-management techné. This complex, which adapted so well to its surroundings, predates Buddhist and Hindu influences by over a thousand years and has shown a remarkable continuity through the Licchavi era (300-750 CE), during which its base rituals were layered over, rather than supplanted. In short, today’s Ningwaphu heritage must be constituted not as a fresh blend, but as a direct descendant of this ancient amalgam, which has survived for 3,500 years through a series of adaptations. All these observations raise the need for a paradigm shift in the historiography of the religious traditions of the Himalaya region. We must forsake linear conceptions of cultural replacement and Sanskritization in favour of indigenous agency and syncretism as the driving forces.

Abstract: This blueprint is designed for emerging activists, students, and community members who want to build effective, reform oriented social movements but may not know where to begin. Using food insecurity and food deserts in Los Angeles County as a case study, the guide demonstrates how ordinary people can organize, mobilize resources, and create structural change without needing political power, institutional backing, or prior experience. The reading translates major sociological theories—including Resource Mobilization Theory, Framing Theory, Legal Consciousness Theory, Collective Action Frames, Political Process Theory, Performance Activism, and the Sociological Imagination—into clear, actionable strategies that beginners can apply in their own communities. Alongside theoretical grounding, the blueprint offers practical steps for securing funding, recruiting volunteers, framing injustice, engaging policymakers, and building real-world interventions such as community gardens.

Initially, citizens have incomplete information to make these judgments successfully. To obtain the necessary information, protesters rely on external sources, such as news or social media networks. Most importantly, however, is the information generated from neighbors and other nearby citizens. Social proof, where individuals seek optimal decision-making in times of uncertainty by observing the actions of others, is significant where criminal laws may be violated. Individuals’ apprehensions regarding government reprisal are mitigated when observing successful protests with analogous law enforcement conditions and comprising similar participants. Previous studies have demonstrated that geography exerts a pivotal influence on the diffusion of protests. Despite increasing use of communication technologies, I hypothesize that geography remains an important predictor of violent protest diffusion, specifically due to the ongoing necessity for social proof. This study provides both a substantive and methodological contribution. Substantively, this study analyzes a country that is in the process of democratic backsliding at an exponential rate, which is not considered in other papers on protest diffusion. Methodologically, I employ a novel Hawkes process model to assess violent protest data from Bangladesh and map the spatio-temporal clustering of events. Unlike prior uses of Hawkes processes in protest diffusion, this model accounts for continuous spatial and temporal dependencies simultaneously, avoiding the artificial boundaries imposed by traditional spatial weight matrices.

The plate features a rigorous “eight-cord pattern” that constructs a standard eight-direction spatial framework, serving as the archetype of the “Eight Trigrams” (Bagua). Its symbolic system accurately encodes the eight key solar terms (including the equinoxes, solstices, and the commencements of the four seasons), constituting a precise “solar calendar.” Furthermore, through unique symbolic combinations such as “five-field,” it translates astronomical nodes into imperative agricultural directives, forming an “agricultural commandment.” The research achieves a comprehensive mutual verification between the artifact and the textual descriptions of Ba Suo (defined as “the theory of the Eight Trigrams, seeking its meaning”) from three dimensions: “name,” “function,” and “meaning.” This study reveals that the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” is not a divination tool but a “pre-literary comprehensive code” integrating cosmology, scientific observation, and administrative decrees. It signifies a key leap in Huaxia civilization from mystical symbols to rational governance around 7000 years ago, substantially pushing forward the evidential timeline for systematic knowledge and advanced governance models in Chinese civilization. 摘要： 本文通过对湖北柳林溪遗址出土的“八索纹陶盘”进行系统性研究，论证其为失传上古元典《八索》的物质原型。该陶盘以严整的“八索纹”构建了标准的八方空间框架，是为“八卦盘”之祖型；其符号系统精准编码了二分二至与四立等“八节”，构成一部精密的“太阳历”；更通过“五—田”等独创符号组合，将天文节点转化为刚性的农耕指令，形成一部“农时宪章”。研究从“名、实、义”三重维度，实现了该器物与文献所载《八索》（“八卦之说，求其义也”）的完整互证。本研究揭示，“八索纹陶盘”并非占卜之器，而是一部融合宇宙观、科学观测与政令的“前文字综合性法典”，标志着华夏文明在距今约7000年前，已实现了从神秘符号到理性治理的关键飞跃，将中华文明系统化知识与高级治理模式的实证年代显著提前。", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t93cb_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/t93cb_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.023216644238382766}, {"title": "Designing social tipping interventions: a systematic framework for scaling up behavioural change", "authors": "Gian Luca Pasin, Giulia Andrighetto, Eugenia Polizzi di Sorrentino, vito trianni", "abstract": "Social tipping, the process by which a new behaviour spreads rapidly upon reaching a critical mass, offers a promising pathway for large-scale behavioural change.

This paper introduces a two-phase framework to guide researchers and policymakers in developing effective social tipping interventions. The first phase involves assessing the potential for social tipping by evaluating the prevalence of the target behaviour and the underlying preferences and social expectations that sustain it. We propose a method for eliciting individual thresholds for changing behaviour, distinguishing between conditional subjects (those who require social proof for changing behaviour) and unconditional subjects (those who are independent of others' decisions). The second phase uses the diagnostic information to inform strategic decisions about whom to target and how to intervene to activate the social tipping process. We analyze the trade-offs between targeting different subpopulations (e.g., amenable vs. resistant individuals) and propose a “stepping stone” approach that breaks down change into manageable steps, which can be particularly effective in populations with polarized individual thresholds.

This study examines how Azerbaijani identity in Iran is formed, negotiated, and transformed under conditions of partial recognition and institutional constraint, with particular attention to recent identity awakening. Method. The study adopts a mixed qualitative design, combining a thematic literature review with semi-structured interviews and contextual analysis of developments since the early 2000s. Interview data were analysed iteratively using an identity-spectrum framework, supported by member checking and triangulation. Results. Increased visibility and articulation of Azerbaijani identity have occurred alongside continued suppression and selective recognition, producing asymmetric identity change. Individuals are more likely to shift toward stronger Azerbaijani identification following experiences of misrecognition, with collective arenas such as sport, media, activism, and politics amplifying these dynamics.

However, the measurement of survey items may differ across modes, introducing ‘mode effects’, a type of systematic measurement error which can bias analyses of mixed-mode data. While the theoretical mechanisms giving rise to mode effects have been discussed in detail, the empirical evidence on their occurrence and size is fragmented. In addition, while many existing statistical approaches for handling mode effects require unrealistic assumptions, other more suitable approaches remain underutilised due to the need for external evidence on the magnitude of mode effects. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of the experimental literature on mode effects. We searched multiple bibliographic databases, grey literature sources, and implemented backwards and forwards citation screening. Studies eligible for inclusion were (quasi-)experimental, sampled from the general population (or age-, sex-, region-specific strata), and reported mode effect estimates on item measurement. We extracted comprehensive information relating to the study design, sampling, mode effect estimates, and reporting. Ninety experimental studies published between 1967 and 2024 met the inclusion criteria, which included 4,113 mode effect estimates for 3,545 unique variables in total. Mode effects were generally small, typically below 0.2 SD. However, larger mode effects were more commonly observed when modes differed by interviewer involvement or by question delivery (visual vs aural), as well as for sensitive items (e.g., sexual behaviour, social life), which aligns with pre-existing theory on the causes of mode effects. Generally, where mode effects occur, they are item-, mode-, and population-specific.

Previous research, most notably Fitza (2014), used ANOVA to decompose variance and showed that CEO effects are minimal after accounting for randomness. However, linear models ignore complex relationships and delayed leadership influence. This work replicates Fitza’s analysis and advances the argument by using XGBoost, a non-linear machine learning technique, on an enhanced dataset spanning 1999–2024 that includes Compustat, ExecuComp, and BoardEx data. Our model integrates comprehensive CEO traits (e.g., tenure, education, remuneration) as well as firm-level financial indicators, resulting in lagged variables across an eight-year period that capture both immediate and cumulative effects. The XGBoost model shows strong predictive performance (train R² = 0.675; test R² = 0.546), indicating significant explanatory power for firm performance. According to feature importance analysis, firm-level financial indicators dominate short-term prediction over CEO-related variables. A combined lag-year and entity-type study reveals that firm effects peak in the current year and then rapidly fall after two years, whereas CEO influence steadily grows until year three and then stabilizes over time.

We investigated whether sanctions are associated with transitions into employment or education and whether effects differ among individuals facing labour market disadvantages. To estimate causal effects using observational data, we applied a target trial emulation framework. Methods We used nationwide Finnish register data on 51,312 unemployed individuals under the age of 25 in 2022. Following a target trial emulation framework, we treated sanctions as the intervention and applied coarsened exact matching with importance weights to approximate random allocation. We constructed a labour market disadvantage score by summing five indicators associated with poorer labour market attachment.

Results Overall, 78% of young adults transitioned to employment or education within an average of 10 months. With all sanctions, the median time to employment or education was slightly shorter for individuals who were sanctioned, with hazard ratios over 24 months. Among individuals without labour market disadvantages, sanctions were associated with a 2.7-month reduction in time to transition into employment or education.

Chang, Abby Fammartino, Timothy Mateer, Vidita Save, Lori Rosman, Nancy M. Wells", "abstract": "Introduction: Research on institutional dining interventions often emphasizes the promise of behavior-change strategies in shifting individuals toward healthier, more sustainable diets. While these solutions can be effective in shaping diner behavior, their potential to contribute to larger food systems transformation ultimately depends on how likely decision makers are to adopt and maintain them. With a focus on university foodservice, we explore the role of intervention acceptability in institutional-dining research by identifying the indicators used to measure it and examining how their incorporation within the literature aligns with the operational priorities of prospective implementers. Methods: We conducted a scoping review of 116 studies to identify the metrics used to measure the acceptability of institutional dining interventions. After arranging these metrics into themed indicator categories, we calculated the frequency with which individual indicators were reported and asked university-foodservice stakeholders to rank them based on their relative importance. Results: We identified eight indicators measuring changes in diner experience, dietary health, dietary sustainability, food prices, operating costs, staff satisfaction, institutional sustainability, and organizational culture. While most studies included some metric of intervention acceptability, reporting prevalence across indicators varied by theme, with more studies tracking changes in organizational culture than all other indicators combined. Reporting prevalence, however, was not predictive of how indicators were perceived by university-foodservice stakeholders, with seldom-reported themes, like diner experience, often being rated among the most important, and frequently reported themes, like organizational culture, often being rated among the least. Discussion: Efforts to align research with the goals of foodservice stakeholders are needed to scale sustainable dining interventions across institutions. Our findings demonstrate how the frameworks used to evaluate institutional dining interventions fail to represent the priorities of decision makers responsible for managing foodservice change. To accelerate the adoption of these solutions, institutional-dining research must move beyond assessments of dietary change alone and begin incorporating metrics that matter to prospective implementers.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zgqkw_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zgqkw_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005463498892082752}, {"title": "Work for Stay: Balancing Reciprocity in Accommodation", "authors": "Muqiu Du, Bingqing Xiong, Huy Quan Vu, Xiaohui Liu", "abstract": "The sharing economy has reshaped tourism accommodation, fostering work-for-accommodation exchanges, where travellers trade labour for accommodation as a tourism experience.
