To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I provide a comprehensive measurement of states’ claimable areas. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, minority protection, and maritime sovereignty), I code geographical extents of states’ claimable areas for 1946–2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this dataset by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increased interstate conflicts only when discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as the “most-similar” case study, provide further evidence. These findings expand the emerging literature on territorial norms by providing comprehensive, rigorous, and contemporary evidence for claimability in international relations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101366", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101366", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01689026268443905}, {"title": "Corrigendum to ‘Does switching pay off?

Yet, to our knowledge, such a causal link has only been found in the United States, and even there, it has not been tested by exposure to the most common national symbol: the flag. Thus, we still do not know if such implicit yet ubiquitous reminders of national identity, rather than those that explicitly invoke national pride, are able to reduce affective polarization. In order to fill this research gap, we conducted a survey experiment in Sweden and Denmark in 2023/2024, two countries where national flags are omnipresent yet often ‘unwaved’. Using two versions of subtle flag treatments, our results show that in Sweden, subjects who were primed with a picture of the national flag showed lower levels of affective polarization measured as social distancing, but not in terms of trait stereotyping or party dislike. This effect was not mediated, however, by the strengthening of explicit national identity attitudes, such as national pride.

A comparative analysis of religious cleavages in Western Europe", "authors": "Martin Elff, Ruth Dassonneville, Kamil Marcinkiewicz", "abstract": "Religion has long been considered an important determinant of voting behaviour. However, the secularisation of Western societies has changed its role. Secularisation not only limits the political relevance of religion, it may also affect the nature of religious cleavages themselves. While extant literature suggests that differences between religious denominations are in decline, with regard to differences between religious and non-religious voters there are two divergent expectations, (1) that these differences are also in decline and (2) that there is an increased polarisation between the religious and the non-religious. For the latter expectation, evidence has already been found regarding the United States. In this paper, we examine whether a similar change can be observed in Western Europe. Combining data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and information on parties’ positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we assess the nature of over-time changes in the connection between religion and the vote choice. The results point to an increased polarisation between members of a Christian church and the non-religious, however, we also find that non-Christians are more similar to the non-religious than to Christians. We also uncover a growing division between Catholics and Protestants that does not fit common expectations.

Studies 2 and 3 subjected that hypothesis to harder tests via conjoint designs, and also evaluated extension hypotheses about when and in what sense “legitimacy” is gained. Across studies, the results consistently demonstrate that reforms (of a variety of types) do generate external legitimacy, offering both positive benefits as well as shielding benefits in keeping with theoretical arguments.

The findings show that while candidates initially engaged with the Ukraine crisis, their emphasis on the issue declined over time, as economic concerns dominated the campaign agenda. The analyses confirm that mainstream candidates followed public issue salience more closely than challenger candidates, who engaged in selective issue emphasis strategies. Notably, Marine Le Pen, often classified as a challenger, behaved as a mainstream candidate, prioritizing economic issues over her traditionally owned themes such as immigration.

We reanalyze and replicate a survey experiment studying the effect of acquiescence bias on estimates of conspiratorial beliefs and political misinformation.

We conduct two preregistered replication studies to better understand this finding. In our first replication, conducted using the same survey platform as the original study, we find a nearly identical set of results. But in our second replication, conducted with a larger and higher-quality survey panel, this apparent effect disappears.

Three lessons emerge. First, governance innovations should be sculpted with failure drivers in mind. Because political challenges stall climate progress, climate policy must address these political concerns. Second, governance innovations cannot be expected to deliver a perfect solution devised by a technocratic elite. Policy progress is uneven, slow, and incremental.

With the exception of those who were vaccinated and boosted, the message either had no effect or, more often, produced a backlash that led Republicans to express less favorable dispositions toward vaccination; backlash was stronger for messages sourced to a Democrat or public health official.

Using a multiverse analysis of 720 models, I observe how citizens’ ideological placement of the parties varied from 1990 to 2020 as a function of party ideologies at different levels: in Congress, in state legislatures, and in the electorate. Although public perceptions associate somewhat with elite ideology, more variation is attributable to how citizen-level partisans identify ideologically. This carries mixed implications. On one hand, partisan-ideological sorting in the electorate has made it easier for voters to see the difference between parties. On the other, it leads voters to see the parties as being more extreme than they would otherwise.

Thus, low-income consumers are expected to be hit harder by the higher energy prices that we anticipate over the next few decades. In the model, energy—a complementary input to capital and labour—can be produced either using fossil fuel or a “green” technology. We represent the EU policy in terms of a tax on fossil fuel and show that the European Commission’s Fit-for-55 package implies a 106.4% tax on the fossil-based technology. The output losses from this tax are substantial, and GDP is 6.3% lower in the new steady state. The burden falls primarily on the lowest-income agent who represents the first income quintile and is 47% more worse off than the highest-income agent representing the fifth quintile. The output losses can almost be cut in half if the economy achieves a simultaneous increase in energy efficiency as outlined in the Fit-for-55 package.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueag004", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueag004", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.027360024164357455}, {"title": "Income taxation across countries", "authors": "Xincheng Qiu, Nicoló Russo", "abstract": "This paper examines income tax systems in over thirty countries over the past forty years using microdata from the Luxembourg Income Study.

We do not find evidence that the intervention reduced the prevalence of negative stereotypes and discriminatory opinions toward minorities. In villages assigned to target network-central individuals, we find positive behavioral effects on untreated individuals, including Santals, and village-level administrative data suggest a reduction in police complaints in those villages. About five months after the intervention, we conducted a casual work field experiment involving 720 participants from the main intervention. In this task, pairs of ethnic majority and minority participants jointly produced paper bags for a local supplier under a piece-rate compensation scheme. We find positive treatment effects on productivity for both ethnic groups, with effects concentrated in villages where network-central individuals were treated. For the ethnic majority, increased prosociality, and for the ethnic minority, reciprocity or peer pressure may have contributed to increased productivity.

Drawing on policy analysis, party manifestos, and media sources, it traces Croatia's shift toward liberalised recruitment of third‐country nationals amidst labour shortages and demographic decline. At the same time, migration has become increasingly politicised, particularly during the 2024 national elections. The article introduces the concept of segmented migration governance to capture this dual logic: while policy frameworks have liberalised to meet market needs, institutional oversight remains weak, integration underdeveloped, and political narratives fragmented. Technocratic depoliticisation by the ruling centre‐right coexists with cultural threat narratives from far‐right actors, generating a stratified political field. By situating Croatia within broader debates on migration governance, populism, and post‐socialist transitions, the article highlights the need to better understand how labour migration regimes are shaped by institutional legacies, elite strategies, and regional political economies.

We use the concept of relational loyalty and argue that it plays a role in shaping citizens’ emigration decision-making. Drawing on a survey of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, we find that individuals who perceive themselves as more committed to liberal democratic values than the average citizen are more likely to have formulated concrete emigration plans. However, this perceived value disparity has limited predictive power in determining mere emigration intentions or actual emigration. These results demonstrate that while divergences in political values can influence politically-motivated emigration, their impact varies across different stages of the emigration decision-making process. Our study contributes to the widely used exit-voice framework and deepens our understanding of emigration dynamics among pro-democracy constituencies within authoritarian contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251409759", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251409759", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.8563655027183504}, {"title": "Refugees De Jure versus De Facto: Legal Recognition and the Difference That It Makes", "authors": "Roger Waldinger", "abstract": "Research on the integration of refugees in the United States has uniquely focused on the experience of persons resettled with the refugee label.

By contrast, the same body of research has ignored the experience of persons who exited home because of compulsion but arrived in the United States as self-settlers, a population consisting of persons granted asylum (the legal equivalent of refugee) and the still larger number of de facto refugees, whose quest for asylum has been denied. Correcting this deficiency, this paper contrasts the experiences of Vietnamese and Salvadoran immigrants to the United States, populations that fled violence, arrived simultaneously in the United States in large numbers, and have since grown in parallel fashion. Although most Vietnamese and Salvadorans arrived after passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, which defined eligibility for refugee recognition in universalist terms, the United States only granted de jure recognition to Vietnamese, denying legal protection to de facto refugees from El Salvador.

In this article, we address this gap using a life course perspective to investigate how both direct and indirect migration experiences during childhood influence openness to international migration in adulthood. We distinguish between immobility, return migration, and onward migration aspirations, and explore underlying mechanisms such as socioeconomic status, transnational ties, multilingualism, experiences of discrimination, and identification with the country of residence. Using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 , we find that individuals with a more recent immigrant descent tend to express higher return migration aspirations but lower onward migration aspirations. Direct migration experiences in childhood are associated with greater openness toward migration overall, though differently by descent: among those with a distant immigrant background, childhood migration fosters openness to onward migration, while it increases return aspirations among those with a more recent immigrant descent. These results offer new insight into how migration and immobility aspirations are shaped early life experiences and family migration histories.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251409788", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251409788", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9807435702132682}, {"title": "‘A citizen at last’: return migrants transcending identity and citizenship in Mexico's racialized regime", "authors": "Mónica L.

One answer suggests some pull toward the country of origin (“ancestral homeland”) based on a shared cultural identity.

In this paper, we recognize that the link between the diaspora and the ancestral homeland is malleable. Specifically, we focus on the linguistic link—which can vary both spatially and temporally. We argue that when individuals of the diaspora do not speak the ancestral homeland language with their family at home, the primordial ethnic bond is weakened, and thus, they are less positive toward their ancestral homeland. We test our argument by focusing on the ethnic Chinese diaspora globally. Using the Sinophone Borderlands Survey, we identify and test whether those who speak Standard Chinese at home are more pro-China than their coethnics who speak a non-Standard Chinese vernacular.

In this study, using internal migration data from 2008 to 2023, the structure of interregional migration flows and internal migration trends in Türkiye during the COVID‐19 pandemic were evaluated. The migration movements of the regions before and during the pandemic were analyzed using crude migration, migration effectiveness, and net migration methods to examine changes in interregional migration flows. In addition, the Bayesian ARIMA model was used to estimate short‐ and medium‐term transformations in internal migration flows following the pandemic. This method was used to project internal migration flows at the regional level up to 2035. The analyses revealed a general decrease in migration intensity across all regions during the pandemic period. Furthermore, migration intensified significantly from metropolitan areas to smaller settlements and rural areas during the pandemic. The forecast model developed in the study predicts a decline in net migration rates in regions such as Istanbul in the coming years. In contrast, regions such as the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Western Anatolia are expected to receive more migration in the future. The study concluded that although the migration pull factor of metropolitan cities will weaken, they will retain this characteristic. Conversely, regions that have consistently experienced negative migration from the past to the present will continue to exhibit this characteristic in the coming period.

The prevailing narrative is that global rangelands, from grasslands to deserts, are being degraded by overgrazing due to overstocking. This perception arises from scientific literature, which contains an order of magnitude more studies on overstocking than on reductions in stocking rates. In contrast, over the past 25 y, regions representing almost half (42%) of global livestock have experienced reductions in stocking rates rather than the expected increases. We evaluated socioeconomic, technological, and climatic direct drivers, as well as indirect drivers, of global stocking patterns. Trade and climate had no detectable effects, whereas technological shifts and meat consumption had an impact on stocking rates. Direct drivers were largely controlled by human population and gross domestic product. Wealthier regions, with slower population growth, greater feed supplementation, and reliance on nongrazing livestock, reduced stocking rates. Less affluent regions, facing rapid population growth and rising meat demand but limited technological and feed resources, increased stocking rates. The overlooked reductions in stocking rates may have major ecological consequences at regional and global scales. Destocking can impact biodiversity, fire regimes, potentially increase carbon sequestration, and modify land–atmosphere fluxes. These effects are not simply the reverse of overstocking, as some consequences are irreversible, including state transitions and local extinctions.

While prior research suggests that citizens generally disapprove of this tactic, this study re-evaluates how contextual factors shape these reactions, focusing specifically on cases of public service failure. In many areas of public management, service delivery is delegated or contracted out to public or private organizations, raising the question of whether such institutional arrangements make it easier for politicians to shift blame onto these agents. A survey experiment (n = 955) was conducted in the United Kingdom involving a hypothetical public service failure. Information cues varied the response strategy of local elected officials (shifting blame or accepting responsibility) and the service delivery model (public or private sector; high or low delegation). The results from OLS regression analyses show that participants were generally less approving of blame shifting compared to accepting responsibility. However, approval increased when the organization being blamed was viewed by participants as carrying more blame for failures in service delivery than the official. Although delegation levels did not directly moderate the effect of blame shifting, further logistic regression analysis shows that higher delegation made participants more likely to view the service provider as culpable, which in turn influenced how they reacted to blame shifting tactics. These findings highlight the conditional nature of public reactions to blame avoidance behavior, showing that citizens’ evaluations of tactics like blame shifting depend on their beliefs about who is responsible, which can be shaped by institutional context. The study offers new insights into when blame shifting may appear more credible or justified and underscores the role of context in shaping the effectiveness of political blame avoidance strategies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf038", "doi": "10.1093/jopart/muaf038", "journal_full": "Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005193119725126816}, {"title": "How Do Public Agencies Respond to Budgetary Control?

Scholars working in different analytical perspectives assert that such a decoupling is largely contingent on more stringent climate policy that mandates or incentivizes the reduction of carbon-intensive production. However, there is limited research on whether policy has such a moderating influence. Here, we extend the literature by testing whether more stringent climate policy moderates the effect of economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions using panel data from 1990 to 2022 for forty-nine countries. Building on the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, we advance an approach for estimating country-specific and average short-run and long-run effects with dynamic models that we show outperform other macro panel estimators using Monte Carlo experiments. Using this approach, we find that, on average, strong climate policy stringency decouples economic growth from emissions in the short run and the long run and that the decoupling effect is largest in higher-income nations. However, we also find that greater policy stringency is associated with increases in emissions in lower-income and middle-income nations. We then build a hypothetical three-nation World that consists of a lower-income, middle-income, and higher-income nation and develop a suite of scenarios that differ based on their rate of economic growth and climate policy stringency. The results suggest that steady-state and degrowth scenarios offer the most sustainable futures in terms of lower emissions and that degrowth is the most equitable in terms of reducing emissions.

However, these taxes are being implemented with little to no empirical evidence backing their effectiveness. Objective: To determine whether Washington, D.C.’s 2003-imposed vacancy tax impacted home prices. Design: A panel data set for the years 1978-2013 was compiled for this analy- sis. Data was collected on 13 different variables related to the housing market for 31 metropolitan statistical areas, including Washington, D.C. The synthetic control method was applied to create a counterfactual Washington, D.C. using the available variables and donor cities. House price comparisons were then made over time to deter- mine what Washington, D.C.’s average house prices would have been absent their 2003 vacancy tax, as measured by the synthetic control unit. Robustness checks, placebo tests, and time series analyses were subsequently used to validate and investigate the primary results. Results: Contrary to expectations, there is a gap following the 2003 treatment that suggests Washington, D.C.’s tax may have increased house prices rather than decreased or limited them. An interrupted time series analysis also shows a statistically significant break in the house price trajectory starting in approximately 2005. However, a placebo in space test casts doubt on any significant results as Washington, D.C.’s outcomes are unremarkable when applying the potential treatment to other U.S. cities.

As increasing death tolls mean higher conflict costs, they can lower the probability of negotiations. At the same time, civilian killings may increase the conflict’s intractability and decrease trust between the parties, thus lowering the probability of negotiations. I argue that the direction of the effect of civilian targeting depends on insurgent ideology. When the insurgents’ extremity is low, they can use civilian targeting to exert power and pressure the government into negotiations. When their extremity is high, civilian targeting is more likely to have the opposite effect: Killing civilians can lower trust in the insurgents and entrench cleavages in society. Apart from this moderated effect via civilian killings, I also expect extremity to have a direct effect on the probability of conflict parties entering into meaningful negotiations. As high extremity increases both commitment and indivisibility problems, insurgents are less likely to meaningfully negotiate with increasing extremity.

The literature does not provide sufficient theoretical arguments and empirical evidence linking fiscal strength in autocracies to mass mobilization. In my paper, I suggest that fiscal capacity shapes authoritarian stability: autocracies with greater fiscal room can finance public goods, the military and security apparatus at high levels, solving the fundamental problem of authoritarian control and power-sharing. Moreover, higher fiscal capacity increases protest costs for citizens, which constitutes a \"silence-buying\" effect, a new term I coin in the context of authoritarian civil resistance. My argument stems from some comparative politics theories and theoretical statements of Jack Goldstone and Theda Skocpol. Using panel data on violent mass anti-regime mobilization from 2003 to 2022 and introducing a novel operationalization of fiscal capacity as central government debt, I employ logistic models for protest onset and negative binomial models for protest counts to estimate the effect of the central government debt on violent contention.

While wage support can stabilise incomes and boost labour supply in the short term, skill-development subsidies are often promoted as a means of enhancing long-term employability and productivity, though their effectiveness varies widely across contexts. This paper asks: under what institutional and incentive conditions do skill-development subsidies outperform direct wage support in improving long-term labour market outcomes? Using a comparative policy analysis based on secondary data from OECD, World Bank, and ILO evaluations, the paper examines how labour market incentives, employer participation, and institutional capacity shape policy performance. The analysis finds that skill-development subsidies generate superior long-term outcomes when programs are closely aligned with labour market demand, supported by credible employer involvement, and implemented by institutions capable of enforcing targeting and quality standards. In the absence of these conditions, direct wage support often delivers more predictable short- to medium-term results.

This paper argues that neither claim is supported by the new measurement agenda. It shows that new drain estimates rely on untenable premises -- in particular, claims of North-South parity in productivity and export composition. Stipped of these assumptions, Hickel et al's method can't yield a counterfactual ``fair price\" vector, meaning that their estimates are ungrounded and indeterminate.

Moreover, the literature tends to treat global mindset, strategic cognition, and export orientation as separate constructs, resulting in fragmented insights and inconsistent empirical findings. Addressing these gaps, this study proposes the development and empirical examination of Global Export Strategic Mindset (GESM) as a conceptually derived construct that functions as a strategic mechanism linking global network and global dynamic capability to export performance. GESM is conceptualized as a cross-level strategic capability that integrates managerial global perspective, strategic cognitive processing, and organizational commitment to exporting. Operationally, GESM is modeled as a higher-order construct comprising three dimensions: Global Strategic Cognition, Strategic Export Commitment, and Global–Local Strategic Integration. This study adopts a quantitative, explanatory research design. Data are planned to be collected through a survey of exporting SMEs in Indonesia and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to examine the proposed structural relationships and the mediating role of GESM.

Nesse contexto, este artigo adota delineamento exploratório-descritivo e abordagem mista, com triangulação entre dados públicos, documentos institucionais e revisão crítica da literatura internacional, a fim de mapear e descrever mecanismos de influência corporativa no setor farmacêutico em oito eixos: (i) lobby e financiamento eleitoral; (ii) influência em órgãos de regulação e fiscalização; (iii) influência em organizações de pacientes; (iv) influência na elaboração de diretrizes clínicas; (v) manipulação, promoção e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos; (vi) escrita fantasma; (vii) estratégias de ampliação diagnóstica e promoção de doenças; e (viii) financiamento e oferta de benefícios a prescritores e instituições, incluindo mecanismos psicossociais e dimensões formativas.

The release of these locational data provides a rare opportunity to examine the opaque geography of contemporary surveillance and to assess whether ALPR camera deployment reproduces the same racialized and classed patterns long associated with policing and state surveillance in the United States. In this article, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and descriptive statistical analysis to map the distribution of 614 Flock Safety ALPR cameras in relation to racial and poverty profiles of the neighborhoods where the cameras are located. Our findings show that ALPR camera deployment is deeply and systematically racialized and economically stratified, with predominantly Black and high-poverty neighborhoods bearing a disproportionate share of ALPR surveillance infrastructure across Hampton Roads.

But contra Ray’s (2019) emphasis on attending to “broadly shared racial schemas,” this paper employs Durkheim’s notion of sacred–profane divisions to argue that analysts should focus on the case-specific issue of the binary divisions that define legitimacy within a particular organizational field. It is via hallowed institutional categories that organizations produce, encode, and obscure racial disparities and meanings. To illustrate the potential and flexibility of such an approach, this paper takes up the case of the alternative food sector, drawing on 11 months of ethnographic research at a large farmers market and analysis of four decades of organizational records. Findings reveal how the racial order is reinforced not only through racial animus and racial schemas, but it also unfolds via the most ordinary of this market’s organizational pathways, from membership lists, certifications, and placement in geographical space.

This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain mechanisms of trust exploitation in religious-collectivist communities, with empirical focus on documented fraud cases in Indonesia and the Southeast Asian region. Drawing on synthesis of literature regarding particularized versus generalized trust in social psychology, affinity fraud documentation in fraud prevention research, victimization theory, and empirical case studies, this paper identifies three interacting mechanisms. First, trust calibration mismatch reveals how lived experience in high-trust environments develops trust heuristics optimal for in-group contexts but vulnerable when out-group actors adopt in-group signals. Second, religious rationalization encompasses assumptions about religious deterrence and delegation of justice to God, reducing urgency for verification or formal reporting. Third, temporal familiarity exploitation demonstrates how perpetrators systematically build long-term relationships before large financial extraction. These three mechanisms generate an opportunity structure aligned with Fraud Triangle theory, where detection probability and punishment probability remain low while payoffs are substantial. This paper maintains a critical distinction between religious teachings (which explicitly prohibit deception) and religious identity as social signal (which can be exploited). The vulnerability analyzed is contextual rather than inherent to religiosity itself, emerging from specific configuration of high collectivism, religiosity as dominant identity marker, weak formal institutions, and strong social harmony norms.

We show how this approach can operationalize radical sociological imagination, challenge expert monopolies on rationality, and reduce inequalities in participation, knowledge production, and global governance.

Demands for strong forms of coordination between system elements and across institutional spheres increase. However, such systems planning raises distinct capacity and legitimacy demands. The availability of robust institutions for systems planning is therefore a key, hitherto neglected success factor for advanced energy transitions. To develop this argument empirically, we draw on an in-depth qualitative case study of the German energy transition as a paradigmatic case in which successful renewable expansion has led to a growing mismatch between legacy system features and transition affordances.

Methods: We analyzed 1,710 chat sessions (202,336 messages) from QuickChat, a Singapore youth chatline between 2016 and 2020. Large language models classified sessions as suicidal or self-harm related (n=406, 24%) or non-suicidal (n=1,304, 76%). User-reported outcomes measured service quality and coping ability. Twelve therapeutic skills were coded from 79,587 worker messages. Multilevel regression models examined skill-outcome associations. Results: Suicidal-related sessions were significantly longer, contained more messages, and yielded lower outcomes. Suicidal ideation was most prevalent (85%), followed by self-harm (43%). In suicidal sessions, normalization demonstrated the strongest associations with all outcomes, followed by teaching/psychoeducation and making strengths explicit. These patterns differed substantially from non-suicidal sessions. Conclusion: Suicidal-related sessions within general chatlines demand greater engagement and differentiated responses from workers.

We aim to provide updated, comparative evidence on the prevalence of frequent contact (including digital) and close proximity between older parents and their children, and to assess how measurement choices affect cross-national patterns in Europe. Methods. We use data on 23 European countries from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe wave 9 (2021–2022) and the European Social Survey round 10 (2020–2022) to estimate the prevalence of frequent contact and close proximity across different approaches: most-contacted versus random child, any versus mode-specific contact, distance versus travel-time thresholds. Cross-national coherence is assessed with Spearman rank correlations and Kendall’s W. Results. We find a pronounced regional gradient: Southern Europe shows the highest levels of frequent contact and close proximity, Nordic and Continental countries the lowest, and Eastern Europe are in-between with internal heterogeneity. Digital communication is part of the intergenerational repertoire, albeit not clearly geographically patterned. Face-to-face and phone contacts remain dominant; texting is less widespread, while video calls remain rare. Measurement choices substantially shift prevalence levels but much less the ranking of countries that remains consistent also when adjusting for socio-demographics. Discussion. We document persistent family-regime differences and highlight digital contact as a supplementary facet of associational solidarity. Results point to risks of a double exclusion for older adults who lack face-to-face contact and cannot exploit digital tools and underscore that survey design choices matter for levels but not ranking-based comparisons, supporting the use of random-child items in general surveys.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uqept_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uqept_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.030868686990175975}, {"title": "Criminal Nucleation and Phase Transitions: A Nonlinear Framework for Organized Violence in Mexico (2000–2024)", "authors": "Araceli Vázquez-Ocaña, Alan-Alberto Ramírez-Guevara", "abstract": "This study proposes a non-linear analytical framework, inspired by phase-transition theory, to explain abrupt regime shifts in organized violence within weak institutional systems.Using Mexico (2000-2024) as a primary case, we demonstrate that criminal violence does not escalate linearly but undergoes a \"phase transition\" once specific thresholds are crossed.

Empirical validation shows a structural rupture between 2007 and 2010, where homicide rates shifted from a stable regime (8.5–10 per 100k) to a chronic state (25–29 per 100k). By operationalizing a comparative Kinetic Risk Index (R = k/ΔG), the framework classifies cities into distinct systemic states rather than providing point predictions.

By Wave 9, when most respondents are in their late 20s, the Germanness of social networks is closely linked to political preferences: native majorities with more German-centric networks are less likely to support left-wing parties, while the inverse is true for most of their immigrant-origin peers. These patterns reflect distinct but complementary mechanisms: for immigrants and their descendants, majority ties signal structural assimilation into “mainstream” political culture and convergence with liberal-cosmopolitan norms; for natives, ethnically diverse social networks reinforce enculturation into progressive political communities.

Alternative visions of stories, histories, skills, technologies, and priorities can then be mapped and archived as a possibility, first of all, of the existence of different ways of living and, second of all, as tools ready to challenge the existing dominant conception.

Using microdata from six large-scale surveys, covering 82,187 individuals (born 1995–2009) across 24 European countries, we assess gender gaps across eight attitudinal dimensions of gender equality. We ask how attitudes differ by gender, how these gaps vary across countries, and how they relate to country-level gender equality. Our findings reveal widespread gender gaps, with young women consistently expressing more egalitarian views than young men. However, the magnitude of these gaps vary across countries and dimensions. Gender gaps are comparatively smaller for gender role norms, such as shared parenting, but larger for attitudes toward labor market fairness, perceptions of discrimination, and the salience of gender equality.

Drawing on Simondon’s account of technical individuation and Hui’s notion of digital objects, I reconstruct the concretisation of climate KPIs in European sustainability reporting from avoided-emissions claims to scenario-indexed pathways, sectoral intensities, and ESRS-aligned transition-plan disclosures designed for downstream recomputation. I contrast this trajectory with biodiversity disclosure, where indicators often remain procedural and delegative, outsourcing commensuration to future modelling capacities and to spatial “sensitivity layers” that are still missing or unevenly implemented across platforms. A comparison with impairment-testing sensitivities in financial reporting specifies what a mature associated milieu looks like: discounting conventions and parameter disclosures that render uncertainty governable, auditable, and contestable.

The research method used is descriptive qualitative through field observations, physical measurements, visual documentation, in-depth interviews with puri administrators and cultural figures, and analysis of relevant documents.

By examining proxy-based metrics such as engagement and watch time, it illustrates how these computable indicators gain authoritative status within platform infrastructures, ultimately defining attention rather than merely estimating it. Through an exploration of YouTube’s watch-time economy, this study reveals how a proxy metric is integrated into feedback loops that connect algorithmic optimization, creator efforts, and user actions, creating a self-perpetuating epistemic cycle in which the metric shapes the reality it purports to measure. In this system, issues such as cognitive overload, creative exhaustion, and attentional fatigue do not manifest as quantifiable costs but arise as epistemic externalities—systematically produced yet obscured by the metric’s one-sided logic of accumulation. This study further asserts that this epistemic imbalance extends beyond individual platforms, altering the conditions of democratic attention. The forms of attention crucial to democratic life–sustained, integrative, and deliberative–remain inherently unquantifiable within engagement-focused systems and are thus excluded from institutional recognition and value. Consequently, attention quantification is not merely an economic tactic but a transformation of democracy’s epistemic foundations.

The pottery plate constructs a standard eight-direction spatial framework through its orderly “eight-cord pattern,” representing the archetype of the “Eight Trigrams Plate.” Its symbol system precisely encodes the “Eight Solar Terms,” including the two equinoxes, two solstices, and the four seasonal commencements, constituting a sophisticated “solar calendar.” Furthermore, through unique symbolic combinations such as “Wu (五)-Tian (田),” it transforms astronomical nodes into rigid agricultural instructions, forming a “Charter of Agricultural Timings.” This research achieves a complete mutual verification between the artifact and the Ba Suo as recorded in later texts (“the theory of the Eight Trigrams, seeking its meaning”) from the triple dimensions of “name, substance, and meaning.” The study reveals that the “Eight-Cord Pattern Pottery Plate” is not a divination instrument, but rather a “pre-literary comprehensive codex” integrating cosmology, scientific observation, and administrative decree.

Public reactions to news stories frequently point to inattentive parenting as the cause, even though studies show that many offenses are committed by people the child already knows, including juvenile peers and family members, and that today’s parents are far more involved in children’s daily lives than those of past generations. This chapter examines why public conversations about online crimes against children often attribute blame to neglectful parenting despite evidence of more complicated situations. The chapter first reviews what is currently known about family environments, parenting practices, and online children victimization, then draws on the Life Course Perspective for insight on online risks and public perceptions of them. From this framework, children’s online vulnerability is less a function of parental vigilance than of current historical contexts including sociocultural lag. As such, preventative programs must take into account these factors. Additional Life Course principles help explain why families and observers may struggle to understand what it means to “protect children online.” The aim is to view family-level prevention, and calls for it, within social and technological systems rather than treating parents, or any other single group, as a primary line of defense against online child predation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sh9pq_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/sh9pq_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004846897426903363}, {"title": "Mode effects in cognitive assessment: Analysis of an experiment using in-person, video and web data collection", "authors": "Konstantinos G.

This paper provides empirical evidence on mode effects (web, in-person, video interviewing) in the measurement of cognitive abilities using the TestMyBrain Backward Digit Span test (an immediate serial recall task) among adults age 20-40 years in England. Participants completed surveys including the same cognitive test at two time points two weeks apart and were randomly allocated to mode at each wave. The 1,692 wave 1 respondents and 1,510 wave 2 respondents were analysed using mixed effects models to estimate mode effects relating to several assessment outcomes. We found that participation by web was associated with a higher likelihood of an incomplete assessment relative to both in-person and video interviewing, suggesting that the presence of an interviewer – even if not physically present as in video interviewing – enhances the likelihood of a successfully completed test. For participants who completed the cognitive assessment, we found no evidence that the observed mean scores differed by mode, though this appeared to mask some heterogeneity. Although based on small numbers, there was a trend for both web and video respondents to be more likely to obtain the highest test scores than those participating in-person. This is consistent with prior suggestions that individuals in modes where there is limited or no interviewer presence are more likely to cheat. Mean test scores were consistently higher at wave 2 than at wave 1, with this ‘retest gain’ differing little by mode.

Nairobi Metropolis continues to experience a persistent housing deficit characterized by project delays, cost overruns, quality compromises, and occasional structural failures, despite sustained public and private sector interventions. This study examined the influence of Environmental Assessment Design as a project design practice on the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi Metropolis, Kenya, and further assessed the moderating role of the Regulatory Framework on this relationship. Anchored on a pragmatist research philosophy, the study adopted a descriptive and explanatory research design, utilizing quantitative methods. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders involved in affordable housing projects, including project managers, consultants, contractors, and regulatory officers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test both direct and moderating effects. The findings revealed that Environmental Assessment Design had a statistically significant positive influence on the implementation of affordable housing projects, explaining 26.9% of the variance in implementation outcomes. When the Regulatory Framework was introduced as a moderating variable, the explanatory power of the model increased substantially to 56.8%, indicating a strong enhancement effect. The interaction between Environmental Assessment Design and the Regulatory Framework was positive and significant, confirming that effective regulatory support strengthened the impact of environmental assessment practices on project implementation. The study concluded that successful implementation of affordable housing projects is not only dependent on sound environmental and technical design but is significantly shaped by the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks. Strengthening environmental assessment processes alongside coherent, well-enforced regulatory mechanisms is therefore critical for improving project delivery. The study recommends enhanced regulatory coordination, streamlined approval processes, and capacity building for project and regulatory institutions.

This study examines the realisation of fertility intentions within a three-year period across four Central European countries (Czechia, Poland, Austria and Germany) employing data from the two waves of the Generations and Gender Survey (2005–2015). The study focuses on men and women aged 18–39 and includes both childless individuals and parents aimed at capturing differences in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions at distinct stages of the family life course. Its main contribution lies in examining whether and how the age of the youngest child is associated with the realisation of the fertility intentions of parents. The results reveal that the odds of parents realising their fertility intentions decline substantially as the youngest child grows older, thus suggesting the existence of a relatively narrow time window following a birth for the realisation of intentions to have another child, a factor that has important implications for the design of (tempo-related) family policies. In addition, the study shows that while economic conditions influence the realisation of short-term fertility intentions to have a child for childless individuals, they lose their significance for parents.

We differentiate between plausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responses are reasonable given specific question characteristics and content, and implausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responding is not expected and most likely signals satisficing. Using data from the GESIS Panel.pop, a mixed-mode probability-based panel in Germany, we leverage a layout change that transitioned multi-item batteries from matrix to single-item formats to study plausible and implausible straightlining. Our findings, based on mixed-effects logistic regression models, indicate that respondents are significantly more likely to straightline on plausible than on implausible batteries. While question format does not affect straightlining overall, single-item formats are associated with less straightlining on implausible batteries but more on plausible batteries. Additional analyses show that web respondents are less likely to straightline than mail respondents, and this mode effect is more pronounced in single-item formats.

Methods: Items from five surveys used in the Stockholm Region were coded into content areas. Cognitive interviews (n = 19) were analysed for response processes. Rasch analyses were conducted on the Swedish Crime Survey (n = 4,264) and the City of Stockholm Crime Survey (n = 7,333). Results: The surveys covered overlapping topics but used distinct phrasings. Response comprehension was generally adequate, yet some terms were interpreted differently. Respondents found it difficult to isolate fear of crime from other motives in the consequence items. There was no clear advantage to either frequency- or consequence-framed items, whereas intensity stems imposed a lower response burden. Psychometrically, unidimensional solutions were hard to achieve for either crime type or consequence item sets. The evidence suggests heterogeneity across population groups. Conclusions: Current practice involves both strengths and weaknesses. This study suggests paths toward enhanced measurement of the fear of crime. Measuring fear of crime as a single, invariant latent trait is far from straightforward. The heterogeneity of responses across population groups indicates that different groups evaluate their fear of crime types and consequences differently, challenging the assumption of unidimensionality.

Secondary education systems demonstrate persistent gaps between identified mental health needs and institutional capacity to respond. This study employs autoethnographic analysis integrated with systematic engagement of peer-reviewed literature to examine institutional mechanisms through which policy failures cascade into individual psychological distress. Research reveals that surveillance failures are not implementation gaps but structurally produced through educational paternalism, conformity-enforcing social systems, chronic cognitive dissonance in critical thinkers, cognitive impairment resulting from burnout, suppression of authentic identity, and systematic teacher mental health literacy deficits. The analysis yields three principal contributions: (1) a cascading crisis model demonstrating how structural policy failures transmit through institutional, social, cognitive, and psychological levels; (2) reconceptualization of anxiety and critical thinking as accurate threat detection rather than individual pathology in genuinely toxic environments; and (3) autoethnographic evidence of student perspective systematically absent from policy discourse. Methodologically, the study demonstrates autoethnography's capacity to generate institutional knowledge through insider access to dynamics invisible to conventional research methods.

The effect of this review is a novel hierarchical typology of narratives that frame and justify abuse, which are then analysed through the lens of Bandura’s eight mechanisms of moral disengagement (MD). The core argument proposes that the widespread persistence of IPV is sustained by a system of social coherence, not solely individual pathology. Legitimization operates hierarchically: fundamental societal ideologies provide the foundational Moral Justification, enabling the subsequent activation of individual MD strategies (specifically Dehumanization, Attribution of Blame, and Diffusion of Responsibility) by perpetrators. Crucially, the MD framework is extended to show that these narratives are also mobilized by external observers and social institutions to manage moral discomfort and maintain a predictable social order through defensive attribution and the Belief in a Just World.

Using monthly-level discrete-time event history models, the analysis accounts for demographic, socio-economic, and contextual confounders, and further investigates the moderating role of pre-existing climate change attitudes and behaviours. The results show that exposure to both types of natural hazards is associated with a temporary reduction in the monthly probability of conception. Heatwaves, in particular, show a strong and highly significant association, with conception probabilities declining sharply during months of exposure. Floods show a weaker yet still negative association, observed in the six months immediately following the event. Furthermore, environmental behaviours appear to play a moderating role in the case of floods: only individuals reporting environmentally friendly behaviours experience a temporary decline in conception probabilities after flood exposure, followed by a modest rebound thereafter.

Wealthy national governments can afford both routine payments to prepare for and prevent natural disasters and pandemics, and can afford much larger stimulus and relief payments when they occur, with the former being more cost effective, but the latter having much greater political support. Private preparation for major natural disasters is complicated by laws and social norms against price-gouging that discourage private stockpiling. We argue that governments could ensure efficient, market-driven preparations for many forms of disasters, including pandemics, by entering contingent purchasing contracts that follow the risk-transfer logic of ‘reverse catastrophe bonds.’ I In this model, private suppliers pay for the creation and maintenance of medical countermeasures and other disaster-ready supplies in exchange for the government sponsor agreeing to purchase such private stockpiles at a set premium when a disaster occurs. This would allow governments to avoid unpopular spending on disaster stockpiling, increase societal levels of stockpiling, incentivize private actors to predict and prepare for disasters, and allow the government to distribute emergency goods via social rather than market mechanisms during disasters or pandemics. This model is a form of contingent purchasing agreement related to, but distinct from, advance market commitments.

This research report builds on a secondary analysis of two experience sampling studies on the use of phones for coping with stress in two samples of mothers (NStudy1 = 50; NStudy2 = 225). Both studies asked mothers to report on stressful situations that had happened in the last two hours several times a day. We tested whether phone use in a stressful situation was related to less perceived coping effort and whether decreased coping effort related to more perceived coping efficacy. We find no support for the relation between effort and coping efficacy and mixed support for the relation of phone use and effort. Especially the inconclusive relationship between effort and smartphone use is surprising and challenges often used arguments in the mobile communication literature.

In higher education, instructors must form short-lived teams using limited data while balancing pedagogical goals and logistical constraints, conditions that differ sharply from professional team settings. To address this fragmentation, this study develops an integrated taxonomy of educational TFP grounded in a systematic review of 35 peer-reviewed studies. Building upon perspectives from Operations Research, Organizational Psychology, and Educational Research, the taxonomy organizes TFP variants into three interrelated pillars: (1) Input attributes, which specify the student attributes used to form teams; (2) Problem formulation, which describes how attributes are manipulated and formalizes pedagogical objectives and constraints into optimization model; and (3) Solution methods, which describe the algorithms used to generate feasible team assignments. This structure clarifies the modeling decisions that underpin different TFP variants and provides a common vocabulary for describing them, enabling transparent reporting and meaningful comparison between studies that previously lacked a shared frame of reference. This structure makes explicit how pedagogical rationales, such as fairness, peer learning, or cohesion, translate into concrete modeling decisions, enabling transparent reporting and like-for-like comparison across studies that were previously not comparable. The review reveals substantial heterogeneity in how TFP variants are defined and reported, and shows that the proposed taxonomy can classify all identified formulations while exposing cross-disciplinary inconsistencies and gaps. The paper concludes with methodological guidelines that standardize how TFP variants should be specified and reported, supporting transparent communication, comparative analysis, and future benchmarking of team formation methods in educational contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8xua_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/b8xua_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005336984670764711}, {"title": "Daily 60-minute interval electricity use patterns and their association with household socio-demographics", "authors": "Reza Serati, Bettina Grün, Anna Kristina Zinn, Sarah MacInnes, Oscar Yuheng Zhu, Danyelle Greene, Marius Portmann, Siamak Layeghy, Joanne Hamer, Daniel Eghbal", "abstract": "Australia leads the world in rooftop solar photovoltaic systems.

Despite a proliferation of experimental tools for quantifying, assessing, and monitoring impacts on biodiversity (physical materiality), there is a gap as regards reputational materiality. Nature PRISM aims to complement existing approaches, by quantifying reputational materiality for industry, regulators, and investors. It is an automated data-driven tool, that assesses the perceived impact of corporate activity on biodiversity through a large-scale machine-learning analysis of publicly-available information. The tool is based on a Directed Acyclic Graph structured around a DAPSIR (Driver, Action, Pressure, State, Impact, Response) framework, providing a novel holistic approach to monitoring and reporting perceptions of biodiversity impacts. Importantly it picks up not just negative impacts, but also positive impacts and responses to biodiversity loss. We demonstrate the potential of Nature PRISM to reveal the extent of perceived correlations between drivers and biodiversity indicators across a wide range of sectors, using a novel dataset of over three million long-form news articles, identified through a set of expert- derived and industry-standard keywords.

When clinical trials and health studies fail to include representative samples, the treatments and interventions they validate may work differently—or not at all—for excluded groups. This is not merely an equity concern; it is a validity crisis that undermines the scientific foundation of Canadian healthcare. Our assessment of global health datasets and Canadian research infrastructure reveals that this problem stems not from researcher indifference, but from a critical gap between policy aspirations and operational capacity.

The net effect of these interacting and competing influences on the overall effort required in, and efficiency of, a funding process is not currently known and so is investigated in this work using an Agent-Based Modelling approach. The results of this model suggest that while the number of applications submitted will indeed increase, perhaps by as much as 40%, if two-stage processes are used, the level of applicant effort per unit output (that is, unit of funding awarded or number of awards made) may be reduced by around 15% to 20%.

Patient and visitor themes included contextual significance of medical space, user-dependent emotional and psychological benefits, curiosity and artistry appreciation, and personal relationship to the artist. Cross-population triangulation indicated complex convergence on content appreciation and emotional impact, with distinct considerations emerging based on each group's unique relationship to the healthcare environment. With the exception of a couple negative responses, the exhibition positively influenced user experiences, offering emotional, intellectual, and aesthetic benefits. Overall, carefully curated art that balances intellectual stimulation, emotional benefits, and contextual sensitivity can enhance wellbeing in primary care settings. Recommendations include rotating diverse exhibitions, gathering stakeholder input before commissioning, creating intentional viewing opportunities for staff, and integrating arts programming into healthcare facility design standards.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zbwa8_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zbwa8_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009235306435011137}]
