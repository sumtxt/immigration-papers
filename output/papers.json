Focusing on long-term status change, operationalized as intergenerational occupational mobility, we find a strong relationship between mobility and support for the far right across 11 European countries. Moreover, adopting a modeling approach that addresses confounding between status levels and status change, we demonstrate an asymmetry: while downward mobility predicts increased far-right voting, upward mobility has little effect.

This paper explores when central states invest in establishing bureaucratic presence. We argue that twentieth-century peasant mobilization provided an important impetus for incumbents to create bureaucratic agencies. Using a novel dataset of bureaucratic presence and municipal-level data on peasant collective action in mid-twentieth-century Peru, we show that the Peruvian president responded to peasant mobilization by investing in new bureaucratic offices that could respond to peasant demands. We further demonstrate that these investments in bureaucratic offices endured, enabling the implementation of pro-peasant policies and reducing violence during the Shining Path insurgency of the late 20th century. This suggests a surprising reversal: early peasant mobilization is associated with a long-term reduction in later rural unrest.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00104140251349660", "doi": "10.1177/00104140251349660", "journal_full": "Comparative Political Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009504743999354415}, {"title": "Rural representation in Europe: The presence of place in national parliaments", "authors": "Guillem Rico, Rub\u00e9n Garc\u00eda del Horno, Enrique Hern\u00e1ndez", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102962", "doi": "10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102962", "journal_full": "Electoral Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.15931699921307096}, {"title": "Place-based resentment and party support in multiparty systems: A study of three consecutive elections in the Netherlands", "authors": "Twan Huijsmans, Wouter van der Brug", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102963", "doi": "10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102963", "journal_full": "Electoral Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.02148249565426419}, {"title": "Self-interest and voter support for defund the police", "authors": "Marcel Roman, Benjamin Newman", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102958", "doi": "10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102958", "journal_full": "Electoral Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.022651768548891393}, {"title": "Happy and glorious?

To test these arguments, we pair large-scale US-based survey experiments involving Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine with the historical case of Germany\u2019s 1951 Holocaust apology. In our experiments, respondents learned whether a foreign state apologized for past offenses, how the target of the apology responded, whether key domestic groups in the sender opposed the apology, and whether the sender was democratic or not.

These effects persisted even if the target rejected the apology or the apology provoked backlash inside the sender, and did not depend on whether the sender was described as democratic.

Estimating an ideal-point model, I find that the predominant cleavage over climate science is distributional\u2014between new and old industrializers with broader ideological disagreements, rather than between large polluters and vulnerable countries. Next, I show that this cleavage is mediated by scientific uncertainty. Large polluters are more likely to agree with each other on interpretations of relatively uncertain science, which allows them to jointly weaken the scientific basis for strong climate agreements.

Once a causal effect has been identified in this way, a wide variety of estimators can, in principle, be used to consistently estimate the effect of interest. While these estimators are all justified by appeals to the same causal identification assumptions, they often differ greatly in how they make use of the data at hand. For instance, methods based on regression rely on an explicit model of the outcome variable but do not explicitly model the treatment assignment process, whereas methods based on propensity scores explicitly model the treatment assignment process but do not explicitly model the outcome variable. Understanding the tradeoffs between estimation methods is complicated by these seemingly fundamental differences. In this paper we seek to rectify this problem.

This made the Bundestag the largest parliament of any democratically governed nation state in the world. To address this issue, the Bundestag passed a reform of the electoral law on March 17, 2023.

This relationship is demonstrated by developing a simple formal model. The German electoral system is a system of personalized proportional representation.

To do so, we introduce five measures of constitutional characteristics that specifically relate to the allocation of political power. We find that military coup plotters are particularly likely to draw on constitutional assemblies in order to produce new constitutions and that constitutions created in the aftermath of a coup are particularly difficult to amend. Individual traits of the coup plotters, such as their (military or civil) rank or their age, are not significantly associated with the structure of the new constitutions.

Using a quantifiable short-run model of oil trade and detailed production and consumption data, this paper evaluates the winners and losers of potential Russian oil-export reductions and connects these to the potential interests of the Russian regime, including Russia\u2019s oil producers and consumers and its international friends and foes. We find that Russian producer profits would fall for any export restriction even as world oil prices increase. For example, a reduction of 10% of exports would yield Russian producer-profit losses of USD\u00a0290 million per day, equivalent to 5% of GDP, mostly due to lower domestic prices. Hence, an export restriction would substantially harm Russia\u2019s oil-industry interests, including the oligarchs and elites benefiting from this trade. However, Russian consumers benefit from an export restriction, as they get access to cheaper oil if Russia exports less. Adding these benefits, an export restriction up to 12% causes net gains for Russia\u2019s oil producers and consumers combined. Categorizing countries into those Russia may consider as foes, friends, and neutrals and using data on their oil consumption and production, we find that foe countries lose the most in absolute terms but friend countries lose more relative to their GDP. Hence, the Russian regime cannot restrict its oil exports without incurring a high collateral cost on its international friends. In sum, to motivate an export restriction, the Russian regime would need to put an order of magnitude more weight on its interest in causing international harm than on its own oil industry\u2019s profits; or it would need to put a high weight on benefiting its own consumers instead of its oil industry.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01302-4", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01302-4", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03067291867021882}, {"title": "Risk diversification and vote decisions in mixed-member electoral systems", "authors": "Susumu Shikano, Erik S.

Accordingly, voters are modeled as risk-averse decision-makers who may prefer diversified vote packages (i.e. split-ticket) when party and candidate uncertainties are highly correlated. The risk diversification strategy abates when voters cast their votes sequentially.

This project delves into the relationship between K-pop fans and power structures within this contemporary capitalist system. I argue that, although fans work to creatively subvert systems of power within platformization, through navigation practices such as gatekeeping insider knowledge, community policing, and self-cooptation, they reinvent community structuring systems that serve to benefit K-pop industry leaders and platform owners.

The quantitative analysis uses Structural Topic Modeling (STM) to identify and map the prevalence of key discourses. The STM revealed how the COVID-19 misinformation on the platforms was mainly concentrated around two discourses: politics and health. A qualitative critical discourse analysis was used to explore how vaccine-related misinformation reinforced or challenged broader power dynamics and hegemonic ideologies around health, science, and freedom. Informed by the quantitative analysis, the discourse analysis focused on two prevalent misinformation topics, revealing how vaccine-critical discourses contest the authority of health institutions and the government by framing vaccines as dangerous, experimental, and illegal. These findings contribute to the broader understanding of how misinformation circulates and evolves in specific sociopolitical contexts. By analyzing the intersections of ideology, power, and discourse, the study highlights social media\u2019s role in mediating public debates during health crises.

Today, a novel yet formidable external force is gradually permeating professional domains: influencer creep , driven by neoliberal self-branding rhetoric.

Using a multi-method approach, we observed 100 Turkish psychologists\u2019 Instagram practices over 6 months and conducted 20 semi-structured interviews. Findings reveal that Instagram has become an unexpected intermediary in the labor market for psychologists, intensifying to fulfill the three pillars of influencer creep: self-branding, optimization, and authenticity.

These efforts also involve negotiating with algorithms, constant optimization efforts, and projecting themselves authentically by trying not to compromise their professional demeanor. Based on these findings, we contend that influencer creep not only alters individual professional practices but also reconfigures the profession itself through four interrelated changes: (a) the expansion of audiences, shifting from small-scale, localized clients to large, mass followings; (b) the redefinition of traditional markers of expertise, where institutional credentials are increasingly replaced by platform-driven metrics; (c) the alteration of traditional gatekeeping structures, as algorithmic systems take on a more prominent role in determining professional recognition and influence; and (d) requiring a new set of skills such as content creation and algorithmic proficiency, often overshadowing conventional professional competencies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251353741", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251353741", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006186824378050293}, {"title": "Same goal, different paths: Contrasting approaches to AI regulation in China and India", "authors": "Puxin Zhang, Krishna Jayakar, Richard Taylor, Chun Liu", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103019", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103019", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.024317804209742833}, {"title": "Overlooked \u2013 Presence and awareness cues in the metaverse", "authors": "Ren\u00e9 Arnold, Anna Schneider", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103020", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103020", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0068024558402086654}, {"title": "The digital transformation of the film industry: How Artificial Intelligence is changing the seventh art", "authors": "Vasilis Tsiavos, Fotis Kitsios", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103021", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103021", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008177147840708221}, {"title": "The Long-Run Effects of Government Spending", "authors": "Juan Antolin-Diaz, Paolo Surico", "abstract": "Military spending has large and persistent effects on output because it shifts the composition of public spending toward R&amp;D.

We argue the answer depends on whether removing tasks raises or reduces the expertise required for remaining non-automated tasks. Since the same task may be relatively expert in one occupation and inexpert in another, automation can simultaneously replace experts in some occupations while augmenting expertise in others. We propose a conceptual model of occupational task bundling that predicts that changing occupational expertise requirements have countervailing wage and employment effects: automation that decreases expertise requirements reduces wages but permits the entry of less expert workers; automation that raises requirements raises wages but reduces the set of qualified workers. We develop a novel, content-agnostic method for measuring job task expertise, and we use it to quantify changes in occupational expertise demands over four decades attributable to job task removal and addition. We document that automation has raised wages and reduced employment in occupations where it eliminated inexpert tasks, but lowered wages and increased employment in occupations where it eliminated expert tasks. These effects are distinct from\u2014and in the case of employment, opposite to\u2014the effects of changing task quantities. The expertise framework resolves the puzzle of why routine task automation has lowered employment but often raised wages in routine task-intensive occupations.

Domestic and international migration movements generally take place from regions with high unemployment to the regions where unemployment is low. Therefore, analyzing the labor market is important for predicting and directing migration movements. The World Bank grouping of countries includes 47 country groups according to their geographical and income status. In our study, the unemployment hysteresis of 48 groups, which includes the average of these 47 country groups and the world in general, has been analyzed. For the analysis of the unemployment hysteresis, six different variables were used: total unemployment rate, female unemployment rate, male unemployment rate, youth unemployment rate, youth female unemployment rate, and youth male unemployment rate. For analysis of unemployment hysteresis, the Fourier PANIC panel unit root test, which entered the literature in 2023, was used. Significant results were obtained for country groups. The results of the analysis show that the unemployment hysteresis is valid for total unemployment worldwide, while the natural rate hypothesis is prominent for youth and young males. While hysteresis is observed in total and male unemployment in low- and middle-income countries, the natural rate hypothesis is generally valid in high-income countries; however, hysteresis persists in female unemployment. Therefore, at the global level, encouraging controlled and need-driven migration movements from regions where the unemployment hysteresis is valid to regions where the natural rate hypothesis is valid, can contribute to reducing imbalances in labor markets. At the national level, selective labor transfer policies, taking into account labor market needs, can be implemented from regions with high unemployment hysteresis.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00467-7", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00467-7", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9815993312040527}, {"title": "Neglected intersections: a view from the South", "authors": "Lorena Izaguirre, Tanja Bastia, Matthew Walsham, Pedro Pablo Cort\u00e9s", "abstract": "While the integration of an intersectional perspective marks a significant advance in gender and migration literature over recent decades, this scholarship remains heavily dominated by studies focusing on South-North migration.

Here, we report comparisons of performance on typical EF tasks by children inside, and wholly outside schooled worlds. Namely, children ages 5 to 18 from a postindustrial context with universal schooling (UK) and their peers in a rural, nonindustrialized context with no exposure to schooling (Kunene region, Namibia/Angola), as well as two samples with intermediate exposure to schooled worlds. In line with extensive previous work on decontextualized/arbitrary processing across such groups, we find skills measured by typical EF tasks do not develop universally: Children from rural groups with limited or no formal schooling show profound, sometimes qualitative, differences in performance compared to their schooled peers and, especially, compared to a \u201ctypical\u201d schooled-world sample. In sum, some form of latent cognitive control capacities are obviously crucial in all cultural contexts.

Community-engaged science, which focuses on shared leadership and mutual benefit in scientific partnership with communities, has the potential to transform science, communities, and even society. Despite this promise, however, community-engaged science is not always transformative. Presentations and discussions at the 5th National Academies Science Communication Colloquium demonstrated the importance of creating structures, practices, and a culture of science engagement that prioritizes listening and learning from communities.

Here, we systematically analyze how cooperation spreads on arbitrary temporal networks, and we distill our results down to a concise condition, which integrates evolutionary game dynamics with both static and temporal interactions. We find that the emergence of cooperation is facilitated by a simple rule of thumb: Hubs (individuals with many social ties) should be temporally deprioritized in interactions. For empirical applications, we further provide a quantitative metric capturing the priority of hubs, which is validated on empirical datasets based on its effectiveness in orchestrating the ordering of interactions to best promote cooperation.

It is unknown to what degree this results from dispositions to form such ties (i.e., to close open triangles) per se versus other processes such as homophily and more opportunities for exposure. These mechanisms are difficult to disentangle in many settings. On social media, however, they can be decomposed - and platforms frequently make decisions that depend on these distinct processes. Here, using a field experiment on social media, we randomize the existing network structure that a user faces when they are followed by a target account that we control. We then examine whether the user reciprocates this tie formation. Being randomly assigned to have an existing tie to an account that follows the target user increases tie formation by 35%. Through multiple control conditions, we attribute this effect specifically to a minimal cue that indicates the presence of a potential mutual follower. Theory suggests that triadic closure should be especially likely in open triads of strong ties, and accordingly we find larger effects when the subject has interacted more with the existing follower. These results indicate a substantial role for tendencies toward triadic closure, but one that is substantially smaller than what might be inferred from prior observational studies.

Among 115 individuals, all of whom experienced severe deprivation early in life, we tracked caregiving disruptions across childhood; assessed pubertal timing and tempo across adolescence; and quantified the pace of cellular aging via telomere erosion across the second decade of life. We demonstrate that a greater number of caregiving disruptions is associated with delayed pubertal timing and an acceleration of pubertal tempo. In turn, accelerations in pubertal tempo are associated with significantly greater telomere erosion across time. A formal mediation model indicated that greater caregiving disruptions during childhood predicted greater telomere erosion through an acceleration of pubertal tempo.

Using a regression discontinuity design to test the impact of regulatory systems on reviews of care, we find evidence that parents in states with less stringent regulations are more likely to post negative reviews and express anger and anxiety, relative to parents in states with robust regulatory regimes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.70001", "doi": "10.1111/puar.70001", "journal_full": "Public Administration Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008272311238462837}, {"title": "Conditions for involving vulnerable citizens in co-production: the importance of commitment", "authors": "Menno Hoppen, Taco Brandsen, Marlies Honingh", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14719037.2025.2523953", "doi": "10.1080/14719037.2025.2523953", "journal_full": "Public Management Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015161220728088676}, {"title": "Policy Growth and Its Impacts on Policy Implementation: Changes, Challenges and Chances", "authors": "Yves Steinebach, Christoph Knill, Mattia Casula", "abstract": "In this Special Issue titled \u201cPolicy Growth and Its Impacts on Policy Implementation,\u201d we present a collection of articles examining the relationship between the policy growth and policy implementation.

We develop a model of multiplex and competing network diffusion to describe how competing actors compete through multiple types of networks. Specifically, we hypothesize three types of contested diffusion: market competition, inoculation, and firefighting. To apply the contested-diffusion model to real data, we look at the contest between Martin Luther and Desiderius Erasmus, the two most influential intellectuals of early 16th-century Europe. In the early phase of the Reformation, these two figures utilized influence networks, affecting which cities in the Holy Roman Empire adopted reform. Using newly digitalized data on both leaders\u2019 correspondence networks, their travels, the dispersion of their followers, and parallel processes of exchange among places through trade routes, we employ empirical tests of our theoretical model. We find that although Luther\u2019s network is strongly associated with the spread of the Reformation, Erasmus\u2019s network is associated with the stifling of the Reformation.

Recent years have seen frequent, loosely coordinated public days of protest with historically unprecedented participation. Yet scholars and activists debate whether even massive protest size translates into electoral outcomes. Resolving this debate is difficult because protest participation is influenced by underlying political conditions, and thus any correlation between protest size and electoral results may be due to unobservable omitted variables. In this article, I conduct a rigorous test of the electoral impact of protest participation in a case that also allows for further insight into the mechanisms for protest\u2019s impact: the 2017 Women\u2019s March. I test the impact of the Women\u2019s March on 2018 county-level election results using detailed geo-coded data on local marches\u2019 location and participation. To address omitted variable bias, I employ an instrumental variables analysis, instrumenting march size with precipitation and temperature data. I find that the number of Women\u2019s March participants had a significant positive effect on the 2018 Democratic party vote share. To understand why, I further test the impact of instrumented march participation on two other variables: the creation of \u201cIndivisible\u201d groups and donations to Democratic politicians. This analysis shows that larger Women\u2019s Marches led to higher levels of sustained organizing and political donations.

Buzdugan, David Freund, Mats Forsgren, Ulf Holm", "abstract": "This article unveils a new way of theorizing the multinational enterprise (MNE) to explain why it may engage in \u2018anti-societal\u2019 behavior \u2013 i.e. behavior that may systematically lead to negative societal outcomes, such as environmental degradation, poor working conditions, or antitrust violations. Our new \u2018self-preservation perspective\u2019 of the MNE holds that MNEs exert their relative political power to protect their market position, assets, and strategic advantages from political and economic threats. In doing so, negative societal outcomes can result, not as anomalies but rather a structural phenomenon rooted in the firm\u2019s intrinsic drive for survival. Drawing on insights from institutional economics and international relations theory, we argue that self-preservation behavior is more fundamental than profit-maximization behavior, which has long been assumed to be the primary motive of MNEs. We shed new light on why MNEs engage with transnational social spaces through an illustrative case of Tesla's anti-union activities in Sweden.

We thus reason that individuals will prefer co-partisans to AI or algorithmic decision making. However, a switch to AI decision making will have more public support when out-partisans hold policy control. To test our hypothesis, we fielded a survey experiment in the summer of 2024 that asked about 2500 respondents in the US to register their support for AI making the most important economic decision in the world -- the setting of the base interest rate by the US Federal Reserve. The basis of our experimental treatments is the fact that Jerome Powell, the current chair of the Fed, was appointed first by President Trump, a Republican, and later re-appointed by President Biden, a Democrat. We find that when we inform respondents that Powell was appointed by a president from another party, support for delegation to AI increases compared to the condition when the Fed chair is appointed by a co-partisan.

Specifically, while arbitrageurs' toxic swaps generate non-competitive payoffs that are independent of other LPs' strategies, noise traders' non-toxic swaps create competitive payoffs that depend on aggregate liquidity provision. We demonstrate that LP equilibrium payoffs under the concentrated liquidity mechanism increasingly outperform those without it as swap toxicity rises.

Our findings reveal that while overall wealth inequality remained stable, this masks diverging trends across household types and conceals how significant demographic shifts within the overall population, and particularly among households with children, contributed to contrasting inequality trends. Increased immigration and changes in partnership status were associated with rising inequality; however, these effects were offset entirely by the inequality-reducing impact of population aging, educational expansion and rising female labor force participation.

METHOD: We analyzed American Community Survey data on employment rate, by type of disability (or lack of disability), for 2010-2023, Department of Labor data on 14(c) subminimum wage certificates in Community Rehabilitation Programs for 2010-2024, and Department of Labor data on number of workers paid subminimum wages in such programs for 2015-2024. RESULTS: American Community Survey data show the disability employment gap narrowing post-pandemic for every disability category\u2014but narrowing especially dramatically for people with cognitive disabilities. Long-term, the employment gap for people with cognitive disabilities narrowed in every state while Department of Labor data show 14(c) enrollment decreasing in every state. CONCLUSION: Research to inform public policy and hiring and retention practices should take advantage of the post-pandemic improvement in the employment gap for people with disabilities, especially cognitive disabilities, and marketing investments should promote them.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8bzym_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/8bzym_v2", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.017010872408854016}, {"title": "When Can We Use Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE): A Comparison of TWFE and Novel Dynamic Difference-in-Differences Estimators", "authors": "Tobias R\u00fcttenauer, Ozan Aksoy", "abstract": "The conventional Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) estimator has come under scrutiny lately. Recent literature has revealed potential shortcomings of TWFE when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. Scholars have developed new advanced dynamic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators to tackle these potential shortcomings. However, confusion remains in applied research as to when the conventional TWFE is biased and what issues the novel estimators can and cannot address. In this study, we first provide an intuitive explanation of the problems of TWFE and elucidate the key features of the novel alternative DiD estimators. We then systematically demonstrate the conditions under which the conventional TWFE is inconsistent. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of dynamic DiD estimators under violations of key assumptions, which likely happens in applied cases. While the new dynamic DiD estimators offer notable advantages in capturing heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the conventional TWFE performs generally well if the model specifies an event-time function. All estimators are equally sensitive to violations of the parallel trends assumption, anticipation effects or violations of time-varying exogeneity. Despite their advantages, the new dynamic DiD estimators tackle a very specific problem and they do not serve as a universal remedy for violations of the most critical assumptions.

Our review surfaces the respective strengths, limitations, and underlying assumptions of these perspectives and highlights how each perspective speaks to a particular facet of workplace inequality, either encoded, evaluative, wage, or relational inequality.

Toward that end, we provide an integrative framework that espouses a \u201clifecycle approach\u201d to examine AI technology development, deployment, and use as an ongoing, iterative process, as opposed to studying them in isolation.

This study analyzes the topic and sentiment trends in related media articles to validate framing theory within the scope of homelessness.

Analysis identifies a strong, statistically significant connection between gambling and use of substances, particularly among respondents who use slot gambling or sport betting. For the entire sample, 19.7% gambled and 24% took substances. Use of substances, particularly psychoactive drugs and tobacco use, were much more prevalent among gamblers compared with non-gamblers, and an associated pattern, particularly among males, unveiled much more salient features. Log odds ratio and Fisher\u2019s exact test analysis uncovered much elevated probabilities of use of substances among gamblers, particularly among slot machine users, with odds ratios higher than 2.0 among some female subgroups. Nevertheless, internet gambling could not demonstrate strong associations with use of substances, but there revealed an evident modest positive connection among men users. Data on expenditure unveiled the majority of young persons pay less than \u20ac10 monthly on gambling, but there exists a small group with much elevated expenditure. These respondents accounted for the size of the right-skewed distribution and may demonstrate burgeoning signs of harmful gambling.

Quantitative findings from regression and mediation analyses reveal that confirmation bias significantly mediates the relationship between packaging congruence and purchase intention, while brand trust moderates the strength of this effect. The results underscore the role of packaging not merely as a visual identifier, but as a cognitive tool that activates intuitive belief-confirming responses. The proposed model advances current understanding by integrating visual and semantic priming with belief-confirmation processes, offering both theoretical refinement and actionable insights for brand managers.

This paper focuses on developing diverse transformative pathways for biodiversity in Europe and advancing methodologies for co-creating these pathways to inform such actions and governance strategies in a transformative and anticipatory manner. Three distinct pathways for a nature-positive Europe from 2024 to 2050 were co-created with 23 participants during a 2.5-day participatory foresight workshop and analysed to understand the main patterns of change. These pathways were backcasted using three desired visions based on the Nature Futures Framework as a starting point. Post-workshop interviews with nine participants helped map their understanding of transformative change and its connection to the pathways. The analysis reveals distinct patterns within each pathway, despite shared elements such as governance changes and sectoral changes in biodiversity. The first pathway, called D\u00f2igh N\u00e0dair, emphasizes bottom-up transformation through community empowerment, focusing on biocultural principles and diverse sustainable alternatives across Europe. The second, NaturAll, combines top-down restrictive regulation with participatory approaches, centring on sufficiency principles. The third, Return to Nature, relies on expert-driven centralized governance and mainstreaming sustainable alternatives across Europe. Diverse understandings of transformative change among participants existed, ranging from reformist to revolutionary approaches. The methodological choices in the co-creation process led to convergence towards dominant frames within pathway groups, resulting in plurality between pathways but limited plurality within group outputs. The first pathway attracted those interested in radical ideas and creative imagination, the second drew a varied group, and the third appealed to those focused on practical and feasible solutions. The pathways demonstrate how diverse patterns of change and understandings of transformative change can result in a range of desired nature-positive futures, effectively turning concepts of transformative change into practical actions. The techniques used to create these pathways play a crucial role in shaping the results, necessitating intentional design that aligns with specific objectives. This highlights the importance of developing plural pathways to investigate multiple potential futures while preserving a strong sense of ambition and urgency for transformative action.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v4rfh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/v4rfh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.019135869975707043}, {"title": "The student movement in Chile: a social response to the neoliberal policies in education", "authors": "David G.

In 2004 an OECD report notes that \"the chilean educational system its consciously structured by social class\", which clearly demonstrates the profound depth of the political reforms undertaken during the Pinochet dictatorship, and in the case of education, deepened during the the subsequent democratic governments of the Concertaci\u00f3n, in the last 20 years. It is possible to check through the analysis of the legal framework that have provided the resulting organic constitutional laws enacted in those periods, which together with the model of state management of resources are conditioning a poor development of the educational system and its social role, becoming to a legitimity crisis that impulse the social movilisation of students, first from secundary level, and now from the \u201cpublic\u201d universities. This is certainly a long process where the actors have taken their efforts to achieve different objectives, and which is worthy to be analyzed due to the importance that its outcome will have on the socio-economic development of one of the most advanced countries in Latin America, albeit with a large debt for equity. The statement is implied after the case study is that the neoliberal model implemented in peripheral countries in global status, strongly influences the development of education sector, and therefore the impact of this on social mobility.

The Federal Character Commission (FCC) was established in 1996 to provide an enforcement mechanism for the Federal Character Principle by serving as a watchdog for federal government ministries, department and agencies (MDAS) in ensuring that the public service represent the ethnic diversity and the geopolitical divide of the country. Previous studies have identified enforcement challenges of the FCC such as funding and lack of compliance and cooperation from MDAS and parastatals. Few studies have however captured the collaboration of the FCC with the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation (OAGF), through the instrumentality of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information system (IPPIS), and the role it played in the enforcement of a representation public service in Nigeria. This is what this paper sets out to achieve. The paper adopted the Descriptive Research design which involved the use of primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected through key informant interview sessions conducted with officials of the FCC secretariat, Abuja, who were purposively selected. Secondary data were sourced from official documents such as the yearly review of operations and the Consolidated Statistical Analysis Data (CSAD) of federal ministries, extra- ministerial department and agencies (MDAs), newspaper editorials, articles and reports. Data were content-analyzed. The FCC kept data and personnel nominal rolls from MDAs and produced the Character Balancing Index [CBI] used by the recruitment monitoring committee [RMC] to determine representation and make recommendations on recruitment. The Certificate of Compliance issued to a recruiting MDA after completion of a recruitment exercise conducted in line with the prescribed recruitment pattern issued by the FCC RMC, is required by the OAGF for the enlistment of successful candidates on the IPPIS federal payroll. Massive corruption and job-slots racketeering within the FCC proved antithetical to the commission's aims and goals of enforcing compliance with prescribed recruitment patterns for recruitment exercises monitored by the RMC. Incidences of connivance between the FCC leadership and CEOs of MDAs precipitated a failure of the FCC\u2019s enforcement efforts. From 2016 to 2022, the number of States that were grossly over-represented and dominated the federal public service remained the same, while the same numbers of the States that were grossly under-represented continue to lag behind in manpower distribution. As the OAGF through the IPPIS is practically incapable of helping the FCC that has been compromised, the federal government needs to pay more attention to the FCC\u2019s recruitment monitoring exercises to ensure its credibility and make it more effective.

Along with analysing the texts, we also used vignettes and interviews with 11 men to see how they understood these portrayals and expressed their emotions in daily conversations. The research reveals that normative affective regimes frequently render male victimhood as illegible or humorous, reinforcing vulnerability and equating legitimacy with stoic masculinity. We propose affective justice as a conceptual lens for assessing media systems, not only in terms of representation but also in their distribution of emotional legitimacy.

Climate risks do not occur in isolation. Adverse exposures intersect with local school socioeconomic and physical conditions that shape susceptibility to risks. Yet, research on how climate risks intersect with school social and physical factors influencing susceptibility remains limited. This study assesses relationships between climate risk and school susceptibility factors across major U.S. Cities and pinpoints school clusters within cities most in need of climate intervention. We analyzed 4,754 public school parcels in 20 major U.S. cities using climate risk and susceptibility indices. Climate risk was defined by PM2.5, ozone levels, and extreme heat days (Heat Index&gt;102\u00b0F). School susceptibility included poverty rates (free/reduced lunch), impervious surface cover, and inverse greenspace availability (trees, grass, shrub) based on 1m land-use classifications.

We argue that queer media representations serve as affective mirrors\u2014sites of validation, emotional self-regulation, and parasocial connection\u2014while also reflecting tensions between visibility and stereotype. Participants describe how accessible queer media, from Thai BL dramas to LGBTQ+ TikToks, shaped their sense of self, offered imagined community, and created space for subtle but strategic resistance against heteronormative pressures. However, parasocial relationships were not embraced uncritically; they were navigated with both emotional investment and healthy boundaries.

Measuring stability and change in victimization inequality across different socio-demographic groups", "authors": "Ben Matthews, Susan McVie, Paul Norris", "abstract": "Understanding inequality in victimisation across society is crucial to address questions of fairness and justice, even during periods of falling crime. Consequently, a growing body of research has considered how the recent crime drop has affected patterns of victimisation inequality. These studies primarily aim to understand whether different social groups have benefitted equally from overall reductions in rates of victimization; however, much of the existing research is limited by three key methodological shortcomings. Firstly, studies often compare only two discrete points in time, rather than describing longer term changes in victimization. Secondly, they typically focus on either \u2018unadjusted\u2019 estimates of victimisation (which measure differences between groups without taking account of any other characteristics) or \u2018adjusted\u2019 estimates (which take account of additional characteristics), but rarely both, giving only a partial picture. Finally, few studies of victimization inequality account for uncertainty in the victimization estimates which are inherent in analyses of crime survey data. This paper addresses these shortcomings by applying a robust, simulation-based approach to estimating and visualizing temporal change in both unadjusted and adjusted indicators of victimization inequality using data from the Scottish Crime and Justice Survey collected between 2008/09 and 2021/22. Our analysis focuses on nine socio-demographic variables which include individual, household and community characteristics. While the results show reductions in victimization rates across all groups studied, there was clear evidence of victimization inequality between some groups. Moreover, the extent of victimization inequality and how it changed over time varied considerably depending on whether adjusted or unadjusted estimates was used. Overall, rising inequality was most strongly associated with ethnicity, disability and financial hardship. We argue that our methodological approach provides a more nuanced and informative perspective on stability and change in victimization inequality than previously considered.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hmrpg_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/hmrpg_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009521850856212932}, {"title": "Primary Questions: A Survey of Inka-Style Khipu Primary Cords", "authors": "Mackinley FitzPatrick", "abstract": "Primary cords serve a pivotal role as the backbone of most khipus, yet our understanding of them remains incomplete.

Such emphasis is only growing, and becoming more pressing, as the world continues to face a number of interrelated stressors in the form of irreversible climate change, major ecological shocks and disease outbreaks, eruptions of military violence, economic disruptions and deepening inequalities, political polarization and unrest, the rise of authoritarian and nationalist regimes. Crises in these domains are not new, but have been recurrent features of past societies. Although these periods have typically led to massive loss of life, the failure of critical institutions, and even complete societal collapse, there are instances in the historical record of societies managing to turn the tide of crisis even as violence and social turmoil grow. Here, we focus on four such cases of crises mitigated with structural reforms revealed from our previous historical analyses: early Republican Rome, mid-19th century England and Russia, USA during the the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Utilizing structural demographic theory as a lens to explore these cases, we seek to expose the pressures that built up leading to crisis and the early signs of violent confrontation revealed by these societies, as well as to examine the conditions and key decisions made in the midst of this unrest that allowed these societies to turn the tide and enact significant structural adaptations.

Not surprisingly, it is in the interest of political actors to manipulate perceptions of the crowd size, to boost support for or to delegitimize a particular political issue. This paper examines how perceptions of the crowd size can be manipulated using AI-generated protest images. In an experiment, participants are asked to rate the size of the protest crowd from a series of social media images. These images are manipulated to display larger (or smaller) crowd sizes using a generative image model. Results show that manipulation works, and that AI-inflated (or reduced) crowd portrayals lead to higher (or lower) crowd estimates as compared to the unmodified images.

Purpose: This study examined how German otolaryngologists perceive peer social norms and opinion leaders regarding tonsillectomy guidelines, and how these perceptions relate to their own guideline adherence. Methods: In a cross-sectional online survey (N = 100), otolaryngologists reported their tonsillectomy practices, attitudes toward relevant guidelines, and perceptions of both peer and opinion leader behaviors. Guideline adherence was assessed via self-reported clinical decisions. Social influences were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression. Results: While most otolaryngologists reported guideline-consistent attitudes and behavior, many perceived their peers and opinion leaders as less adherent. Guideline adherence was significantly associated with individual tonsillectomy attitudes (OR = 0.18, p &lt; .001) and perceived opinion leader attitudes (OR = 0.33, p = .013), but not with perceptions of the general peer group or demographics. Conclusions: Otolaryngologists\u2019 perceptions of opinion leaders are significantly associated with their adherence to tonsillectomy guidelines, even beyond their own attitudes.
