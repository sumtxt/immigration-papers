Publics prefer war only for large prospective power shifts, but preventive war renders the true size of averted shifts unobservable, incentivizing leaders to lie ex post to avoid political punishment. When publics are ex ante skeptical over shift size and war outcomes are middling, the probabilities of war and political punishment, as well as public skepticism over averted shifts and the chances of erroneous punishment, all increase in war outcomes. Public strategies of punishing military failures are particularly unsuccessful at discouraging undesirable preventive wars, yet the same conditions that encourage preventive war undermine its political benefits. We use our model to explain why Japan's leaders failed to convince the public of preventive success against Russia in 1905.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12984","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12984","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4292,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Partisan sorting, fatalism, and Supreme Court legitimacy","authors":"Nicholas T.

First, we construct a data set of surveys from 2012 to 2024 to show that diffuse support now diverges among partisans; we then analyze an original, six‐wave panel survey that reveals the stability of this partisan sorting. Second, we unpack the direct and indirect effects of partisanship on legitimacy: Democrats are more cynical about the Court, disapprove of its outputs, and view obedience to the law differently than Republicans, which contributes to the profound partisan gap in legitimacy. Finally, we reevaluate the relationship between specific and diffuse support by introducing a new measure of specific support, which shows that “fatalistic” views of the Supreme Court contribute to low levels of legitimacy. Today, Democrats’ pessimism toward the Court has eliminated decades of positivity and goodwill. This fatalistic sorting among large swaths of the public implies that the Court's authority now rests on weak and polarized foundations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12972","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12972","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4863,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Global competition, local unions, and political representation: Disentangling mechanisms","authors":"Michael Becher, Daniel Stegmueller","abstract":"While recent scholarship has demonstrated multiple political effects of international trade, less attention has been paid to unbundling the mechanisms through which import competition affects democratic politics.

Can polarized individuals be persuaded to choose democracy over party, that is, support a candidate from an opposing party who upholds democratic norms when their co-partisan candidate fails to do so? We tested the effect of an online civic education intervention conducted on over 41,000 individuals in thirty-three countries that was designed to promote the choice of ‘democracy’ by emphasizing the benefits of democratic versus autocratic regimes. The results are striking: exposure to civic education messages significantly dampens the negative effect of partisan polarization on anti-democratic co-partisan candidate choice.

Combining an analysis of observational data measuring crimes against politicians with evidence from original and pre‐registered survey experiments, we first demonstrate that attacks on political elites are not associated with fewer female candidates on party lists for local elections. Examining political ambitions and underlying microfoundations with different samples of respondents varying in their likelihood of considering political candidacy, we provide survey‐experimental evidence that information about the prevalence of political crime does not reduce willingness to run for office or engage in politics among female respondents with high political interest but may do so among those with low political interest.

Employing detailed data from the OECD’s Gender Equality Policy Marker, we show that donors engage differently with democracies and autocracies. Among democratic recipients, those with higher legal status for women have less gender mainstreaming aid, suggesting a “needs-based” logic. Conversely, in autocracies, donors respond positively to policy cues indicating the (domestic) political acceptability of gender equality.

Researchers and firms may seek to evade national rules by relocating to more permissive jurisdictions. Second, public unease about new technologies creates the potential for backlash in the wake of controversial applications. This backlash can spill across borders: accidents or misuse in one jurisdiction undermine support for research and commercial development elsewhere. Together, these processes link the regulatory fate of states, undermining their ability to regulate in isolation. We test and find evidence for these mechanisms in the domain of gene editing, a field that has been transformed by the introduction of CRISPR technology in 2012.

Third, we contribute to debates on destination choices by empirically testing the likelihood of internal displacement versus seeking refuge abroad. Using dynamic models and unique comparative data from the OneUA project, which surveyed 24,000 Ukrainian women in Ukraine and eight other European countries, we examine the migration behaviors of those who stayed in their pre-war residence, relocated internally (internally displaced persons), or fled abroad during the first 6 months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Our findings reveal a curvilinear relationship between conflict-induced violence and migration propensity: violence initially increases migration but diminishes beyond a threshold. We also find that forewarnings and indirect threats have a stronger influence on migration than direct threats. Violence catalyzes migration among vulnerable groups, narrowing demographic disparities in migration propensity. However, resourceful individuals retain an advantage in early migration, perpetuating inequalities in escape opportunities. Additionally, we observe distinct patterns of internal versus international migration in response to stronger conflict-induced violence, providing theoretical and empirical insights into the dynamics of wartime migration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251317838","doi":"10.1177/00223433251317838","journal_full":"Journal of Peace Research","dist":0.6054,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The challenges of surveying in war zones: Lessons from Ukraine","authors":"Kit Rickard, Gerard Toal, Kristin M Bakke, John O’Loughlin","abstract":"Conflict scholars commonly employ public opinion surveys to understand the causes and consequences of violence.

We designed psychological interventions, presented as news articles, and tested which ones increased mainstream Jewish majority group members' support for the Palestinian Arab minority's political inclusion in coalition formation in Israel. We employed this context, where the perceived ties between the minority's identity and the identity of the rival in the ongoing conflict make the threat particularly salient, in two critical timepoints: the run‐up to a decisive election (Study 1, N = 1248) and during an ongoing war (Study 2, N = 1391). We found that during the run‐up to the election, interventions targeting value conflict, tension reduction, and norm perceptions increased support for political inclusion, but none of them had the same effect during the war. These findings illustrate the potential of a real‐world intervention tournament, with implications for the promotion of political inclusion in the field.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70030","doi":"10.1111/pops.70030","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.6308,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Values and prejudice in American opinion about immigration: A critical dialog","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70021","doi":"10.1111/pops.70021","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.6292,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The paradox of the mixed semi-compensatory system in South Korea: gaming the system or toeing the mark?","authors":"Woojin Moon, Myung Chul Kim","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01280-7","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01280-7","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.3513,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Violence Against Politicians Drives Support for Political Violence Among (Some) Voters: Evidence from a Natural Experiment","authors":"Alessandro Nai, Patrick F A van Erkel, Linda Bos","abstract":"We investigate whether a real-world episode of physical violence committed in October 2023 against Thierry Baudet, leader of the Dutch far-right FvD, conditioned a differential support for political violence among different voters: voters ideologically close to the target of the attack (in-group) and voters experiencing partisan Schadenfreude toward the party of the target (out-group). The unexpectedness of the attack makes it an excellent case of exogenous treatment in a natural experiment (“Unexpected Event during Survey Design). The fact that the attack occurred in the midst of a survey unfolding a rolling cross-section design yields likely more robust estimations than usually found in similar natural experiments. Our results indicate that the attack against Baudet slightly normalized political violence in the short term. While no specific uptick of support for violence was measured among respondents close to the FvD, in the short and medium term the attack furthermore slightly increased support for violence among respondents who dislike the FvD and experience partisan Schadenfreude.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf010","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf010","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.52,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"New tree, growing forrest: Updating meta-analytic evidence on solidarity between U.S. people of color through an extension and partial replication","authors":"Ramona Alhambra, Emily Ortiz, Efrén Pérez, Tricia Huynh, Haneen Bany-Mohammed, Kiana Rad, Dylan Sherrill, Raymond Castillo, Nicole Crawford","abstract":"Published meta-analytic evidence shows that across five experiments, shared discrimination triggers solidarity between U.S. people of color (PoC), which then strongly correlates with support for pro-outgroup policies. Mini meta-analyses like these remain informative only if all conceptually similar experiments—regardless of statistical significance—are evaluated. We amend this meta-analytic record by adding a new study that only partially replicated the established solidarity pattern. Specifically, our study evaluated whether PoC solidarity encompasses Palestinian people: a racially stigmatized outgroup outside U.S. borders. We tested this through a pre-registered experiment with Black adults ( N = 851), the prototypical person of color. Unexpectedly, we find that exposure to shared discrimination with Palestinians insignificantly affected Black solidarity with PoC. This pattern arises despite exploratory analyses showing that PoC solidarity incorporates Palestinian people. Nevertheless, we still find that Black camaraderie with PoC strongly correlates with pro-Palestinian attitudes, which reaffirms prior work. Finally, with this partial replication included, we meta-analyze all six available solidarity mechanisms through a random effects model. This analysis reveals that PoC solidarity remains a viable mechanism behind inter-minority solidarity. Our results have implications for PoC solidarity and the regular updating of meta-analytic evidence in political science.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251335651","doi":"10.1177/20531680251335651","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.6044,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Can ChatGPT accurately identify the position of parties?

In a validation exercise, we asked ChatGPT and a group of local experts to simultaneously estimate the positions of French political parties in the context of the 2024 European election on a series of issues from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. We find that ChatGPT’s estimations are generally close to those of the expert survey, especially for major and salient political issues (left-right, European integration, immigration). However, it provides less accurate estimates on fringe issues (free market, asylum policies, urban–rural interests) and specific party characteristics (within-party division, issue blurring).

The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies.

But for the connective democratic benefits to be realized, these user corrections should ideally come from those who express strong support for democratic norms. Using a nationally representative survey of Americans immediately after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we find the opposite is true: self-reported correctors also tended to support political violence to achieve their goals. Rather than treating self-reported correction as a clear positive force for democracy, researchers and practitioners should consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of self-reported correction, particularly when coming from those with less supportive attitudes toward connective democracy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251335086","doi":"10.1177/20563051251335086","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.4664,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Quality of Connections: Deliberative Reciprocity and Inclusive Listening as Antidote to Destructive Polarization Online","authors":"Katharina Esau","abstract":"Conflict and disagreement are integral to healthy democracies, but the extreme polarization observed on many social media platforms poses a serious risk to the core functions of public communication.

It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication.

Yet, social media is incredibly heterogeneous and variation in platform affordances may result in markedly different democratic outcomes. In this article, we turn to the principles of connective democracy to inform a cross-topic and cross-platform analysis. Our mixed-methods study compares conversations across Twitter and Reddit, finding that Twitter conversations are highly polarized across topics while Reddit displays some promise for enabling productive, intergroup discourse. We argue that this difference is driven by an affordance of conversational visibility in which users can see and engage with conversations as a whole. We further argue that “community” is a distinctive platform affordance that emerges from shared user expectations. This affordance supports user socialization into democratic norms of productive intergroup contact and therefore may prove particularly important to enhancing connective democracy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251332427","doi":"10.1177/20563051251332427","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.5065,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Transforming cybersecurity with agentic AI to combat emerging cyber threats","authors":"Nir Kshetri","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102976","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102976","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.2423,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Between Government and Market: The Political Economics of Labor Unions","authors":"Ethan Kaplan, Suresh Naidu","abstract":"We survey and summarize recent literature on labor unions in political economy.

Using newly digitized historical records, I find that the Act resulted in significant improvements in school supply and attendance, which in turn improved adult outcomes. In particular, analysis using a regression kink design suggests that public school access improved a child’s chance of obtaining an occupation requiring literacy in adulthood by as much as 17 pp. I use a triple difference specification to show that the effect extended to children further removed from the kink, and that the quality of occupational outcomes increased with each additional year of schooling. To study the reform’s effect on intergenerational mobility, I link father-son pairs across time, matching nearly 4 million individuals using full-count historical censuses. I find that by targeting the lower classes, public school introduction significantly improved intergenerational mobility across numerous measures, with the adult outcome gap between high- and low- class children decreasing by over 10% in some cases.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf031","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf031","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.4968,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Competition, Cooperation, and Social Perceptions","authors":"Jeanne Hagenbach, Rachel Kranton","abstract":"Can competition or cooperation for economic gain affect people’s social perceptions of others?

We find empirical support for both intertemporal and cross-product substitution effects: Households (1) shift consumption forward preceding a tax increase and (2) substitute one good for another and alter their relative weight in the consumption basket to avoid paying higher tax. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that consumers with more personal shopping experience exhibit stronger consumption responses. Our findings have empirical implications for the efficacy of tax policy initiatives.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01584","doi":"10.1162/rest_a_01584","journal_full":"Review of Economics and Statistics","dist":0.4081,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"A Lifecycle Estimator of Intergenerational Income Mobility","authors":"Ursula Mello, Martin Nybom, Jan Stuhler","abstract":"Lacking lifetime income data, most intergenerational mobility estimates are subject to lifecycle bias.

The wellbeing of migrant professionals across professional and personal environments","authors":"Gregor Schäfer, Miguel Morillas","abstract":"Highly skilled migration is increasing both in absolute terms and as a relative share of international migration. The increasing number of migrant professionals (MPs) raises questions about the consequences of their migration - for themselves, for society and for the employing companies. While the wellbeing of different occupational groups is well researched, the wellbeing of migrant professionals remains understudied. In particular, migration studies have not yet captured the implications of migrant professionals’ wellbeing. We theorise an understanding of wellbeing that integrates both professional (workplace) and personal (family and non-work socialisation) dimensions. Following Allardt’s conceptualisation of wellbeing as ‘Having, Loving, Being’, we answer the question of how and what affects migrants’ subjective wellbeing in their professional and personal spaces. We show how the professional-personal interface is defined in the context of transnational labour mobility. To do so, we draw on our unique sample of 42 two-stage interviews with 21 MPs recruited from abroad to high-level positions in Danish companies. We identify four key factors that affect migrants’ wellbeing at the intersection of their professional and personal lives: 1) social alienation at work, 2) professional autonomy, 3) work-leisure balance, and 4) perceptions of equality and meritocracy. Our work is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that shape migrant professionals’ wellbeing in the context of their personal and professional lives.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00447-x","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00447-x","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.588,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Pluralist diversity governance: deepening the multiculturalism-interculturalism nexus","authors":"F. Mansouri, A.

Recently, these debates have particularly centred on what would constitute an optimal approach to managing group diversity and intercultural relations, in a context of global migration challenges, pandemic-related inequalities, rising levels of racism, and international conflicts. While much of the recent literature has focused on whether the two dominant approaches, multiculturalism and interculturalism, offered distinct alternatives, there has been little agreement so far, both at the theoretical and policy levels, on the specific direction future diversity governance should take. This article critically examines this contested discourse by reframing diversity as a multi-layered state of being and knowing, that can be understood beyond mere factual differences among ethno-cultural groups. This reframing is pursued by laying out an interactive framework between the hardware and software of pluralism, centred around key normative articulations in relation to cultural recognition, social justice, intergroup solidarity, and political representation. Such a multi-level approach envisages intercultural understanding being realized not against but within a broader of multicultural context and policy setting.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00446-y","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00446-y","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.6294,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Second-generation education and earnings across birth cohorts: ethno-racial variations in Canada","authors":"Rupa Banerjee, Jeffrey Reitz, Feng Hou, Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2490815","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2490815","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.4761,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"What do indigenous parties want?

This transnational family separation, which often lasts years, can potentially have long lasting negative consequences on migrant parents’ mental health. Qualitative research has documented that transnational parents often report feelings of guilt, sadness and loneliness due to the separation, and that financial or legal precarity can exacerbate these feelings. On the other hand, quantitative research on this topic is scarce, mostly based on relatively small samples and on cases studies of single origin groups in single destination countries, has measured transnational parents’ mental health disadvantage using less than ideal control groups, and has not investigated potential long-lasting consequences of separation after reunification. In this article, I contribute to this literature using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 to investigate differences in propensity to have experienced depression symptoms between transnational immigrant parents, parents who migrated with their children, and immigrant parents who reunited with their children after a period of transnational separation. I additionally look at heterogeneities by gender, age of the children, legal status, employment, and partnership dissolution. I find that transnational parents have significantly worse mental health than immigrants who migrated with their children, especially when the separation involves young children. The mental health of formerly transnational parents does not differ significantly from that of parents who migrated with their children, suggesting the absence of lasting effects of separation after reunification.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251329038","doi":"10.1177/01979183251329038","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.582,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Mothering from the Margins: Ethnographic Reflections on the Gendered Politics of Rohingya Mothers in India","authors":"Raksha Gopal","abstract":"This article analyses the everyday experiences of stateless Rohingya refugee women mothering and raising families within refugee settlements in Delhi.

These gendered expectations increase women's caregiving and social reproduction responsibilities while simultaneously limiting their mobility, access to employment, resources, and social support. Secondly, I demonstrate how Rohingya mothers continuously negotiate a sense of security for themselves and their children against the insecurities engendered by formal governance systems of the Indian State. Finally, I explore how non-state humanitarian organizations and NGOs play a crucial role in the governance of refugee women, shaping not only their access to resources and aid but also women's identities and roles as mothers.

Coverage and completeness of registration systems are critical for the quality of these indicators. However, under registration of deaths is still a major problem today, especially where registration systems are still in the process of being established, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. In the last two decades, Türkiye stands out with its rapidly declining child and infant mortality, as well as its developing VR system. However, the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system in Türkiye has not been fully evaluated yet. The fact that the regions in Türkiye that are disadvantaged in terms of early‐age mortality are less populated poses the risk of neglecting areas that need more investment and improvement in child mortality and data quality. In this study, we assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths at the national and regional levels by using a recently developed model for estimating under‐5 mortality by detailed age. We apply this model at both the national and regional levels to assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system of Türkiye from 2009 to 2022. The results confirm the presence of early death omission in the eastern regions at the beginning of the studied period, for which we propose a correction. The prediction of the model also indicates a strong improvement over time in the completeness of death registration in these regions.

Prior work has focused largely on how interdisciplinarity relates to outcomes for published papers, but which papers get accepted for publication in the first place is unclear. Furthermore, journals may evaluate two key dimensions of interdisciplinarity,—topic and knowledge base,—differently. Topic interdisciplinarity (measured through title and abstract) may incur evaluation penalties by cutting across disciplinary evaluation standards and threatening symbolic boundaries, while knowledge-base interdisciplinarity (measured through references) may incur benefits by combining a large pool of nonredundant information. Evaluations may also depend on how well these dimensions align with each other and the intended audience. We test these arguments using data on 128,950 submissions to 62 journals across STEM disciplines, including both accepted and rejected manuscripts. We find that a 1SD increase in knowledge-base interdisciplinarity is associated with a 0.9 percentage-point higher acceptance probability, while a 1SD increase in topic interdisciplinarity corresponds to a 1.2 percentage-point lower acceptance probability. However, the penalty for high topic-interdisciplinarity diminishes when knowledge-base interdisciplinarity is also high, and when submitted to journals designated as “interdisciplinary.” These findings challenge the narrative of a uniform bias against interdisciplinary research and highlight the importance of distinguishing between its dimensions, as well as their alignment with each other and the intended audience.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409752122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2409752122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4857,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Bridging life satisfaction data and neurobiological measures would elucidate human well-being","authors":"Anthony Brandt, Cokorda Bagus Jaya Lesmana, Elkhonon Goldberg","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2502095122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2502095122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3012,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Unbalanced social–ecological acceleration led to state formation failure in early medieval Poland","authors":"Adam Izdebski, Sambor Czerwiński, Marek Jankowiak, Marcin Danielewski, Sabina Fiołna, Raphael Gromig, Piotr Guzowski, Negar Haghipour, Irka Hajdas, Piotr Kołaczek, Mariusz Lamentowicz, Katarzyna Marcisz, Jakub Niebieszczański, Paweł Sankiewicz, Bernd Wagner","abstract":"Rapid social–ecological intensification is a recurrent feature of human history.

Triggered by the Eurasian slave trade, the first “Polish” polity was founded in Central Europe c. 900 common era. It undertook unprecedented ecological intensification in its core territory, connected with large construction projects, and engaged in rapid territorial expansion. We provide new crucial evidence on this process by publishing here a high-resolution pollen profile from a location close to the polity’s capital and by an application of social network analysis to numismatic data. This state collapsed within a few generations after its foundation. The collapse of the political elites, however, did not produce a complete social and ecological disintegration of the polity’s former core region. We thus show how collapse and continuity can remain closely intertwined. Last but not least, the rich evidence on the mechanism of the collapse reveals that successful maintenance of social–ecological intensification requires reliance on a number of cultural, economic, religious, and social networks underlying the political expansion. The polity’s elite lacked access to or failed to mobilize such networks, which led to its demise.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409056122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2409056122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4091,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Identifying air quality monitoring deserts in the United States","authors":"Nelson A.

While most research has focused on the association between air quality estimates and these outcomes, little is known about the presence of air quality monitoring sites across the United States or the place-level characteristics associated with such placements. We classify counties without a monitoring station as air quality monitoring deserts. Using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AirData active sites directory, we determine the number and location of monitoring deserts. We then study whether demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are associated with the likelihood of a county being a monitoring desert. Our results indicate that 1,848 or 58.8% of US counties are an air quality monitoring desert, covering about 40% of the nation’s land area. Our estimates suggest that more than 50 million people or 15.3% of the population live in air quality monitoring deserts.

Reich, Kathryn Grace, Arun Agrawal, Harini Nagendra","abstract":"Mitigating climate change and social injustice are critical, interwoven challenges. Climate change is driven by grossly unequal contributions to elevated greenhouse gas emissions among individuals, socioeconomic groups, and nations. Yet, its deleterious impacts disproportionately affect poor and less powerful nations, and the poor and the less powerful within each nation. This climate injustice prompts a call for mitigation strategies that buffer the poorest and the most vulnerable against climate change impacts. Unfortunately, all emissions mitigation strategies also reshape social, economic, political, and ecological processes in ways that may create climate change mitigation injustices—i.e., a unique set of injustices not caused by climate change, but by the strategies designed to stem it. Failing to stop climate change is not an answer—this will swamp all adverse impacts of even unjust mitigation in terms of the scope and scale of disastrous consequences. However, mitigation without justice will create uniquely negative consequences for the more vulnerable. The ensuing analysis systematically assesses how climate change mitigation strategies can generate or ameliorate injustices. We first examine how climate science and social justice interact within and among countries. We then ask what there is to learn from the available evidence on how emissions reductions, well-being, and equity have unfolded in a set of countries. Finally, we discuss the intersection between emissions reduction and mitigation justice through actions in important domains including energy, technology, transport, and food systems; nature-based solutions; and policy and governance.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411231122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2411231122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3153,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Convergence and consensus","authors":"H.

However, we argue that unions’ position on welfare state reforms will be affected by insiders and outsiders, depending on their level of membership and activity within the union. We combine macro-level data (content analysis of press releases) on six different unions in Germany with individual-level data (German Internet Panel), including information regarding differently skilled insider and outsider. We use a mix-method approach, and the results show that the attitudes of the low-skilled insiders (blue-collar workers) and low-skilled outsiders (low service functionaries) play a significant role in shaping unions’ positions. Both groups exhibit a high level of union membership and activity within unions. We conclude that this represents an important mechanism for understanding the influence of insiders and outsiders on unions’ position towards welfare state reforms.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf024","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf024","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.5003,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Should social insurance programs count as wealth? Augmented wealth in research and policy","authors":"Robert Manduca","abstract":"Research on wealth and wealth inequality is hindered by lack of consensus on a fundamental question: what counts as wealth? Scholars disagree on whether net worth should encompass only marketable assets or also include non-marketable “augmented wealth,” such as pensions and social insurance programs. Because augmented wealth often exceeds marketable wealth in total value and is much more equitably distributed, definitional choices shape even the most basic conclusions of empirical wealth research. This article advocates for use-specific wealth definitions, recommending that researchers first identify the use(s) for wealth of interest in a given study, then include all assets available for those uses, whether marketable or not. Case studies of Norway and the United States demonstrate the importance of augmented wealth—beyond pensions alone—across the wealth distribution, while a cross national analysis shows that differences in augmented wealth can help resolve the puzzling lack of correlation between income and (marketable) wealth inequality across countries.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf020","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf020","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.428,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The kids are Alt right?

However, most research conceptualizes AI as a form of specialized decision support tool. In contrast, this study presents a different form of human-AI collaboration, the concept of human-AI ensembles, where public managers and AI tackle the same decision tasks, rather than specializing in certain subtasks. This is particularly relevant for many public sector decisions, where neither human nor AI predictions have a clear advantage over the other. We illustrate this within the context of public hiring, focusing on two key areas: (a) the potential of ensembling human and AI to reduce biases and (b) the willingness of public managers to implement ensembling. Study 1 uses data from the assessment of profiles of real-life job candidates (n = 695) at the intersection of gender and ethnicity by public managers compared to AI. The exploratory OLS regression results illustrate how ensembled decision-making may alleviate ethnic biases. The OLS regression results of study 2, a pre-registered survey experiment, show that public managers (n = 538 with 4 observations each) put equal weight on AI advice and human advice, and, when reminded of the unlawfulness of hiring discrimination, may even prioritize AI over human advice.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf009","doi":"10.1093/jopart/muaf009","journal_full":"Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory","dist":0.4475,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The post-oil post-COVID social contract: taxing informal workers for healthcare insurance in oil-exporting developing economies","authors":"Tom Moerenhout, Nicolas Orgeira Pillai, Joonseok Yang","abstract":"To improve health coverage and revenue collection, several African countries consider tax-for-health-services programs where informal workers pay income tax for health insurance.

This article draws on 120 interviews with four groups of workers who confront temporal and spatial instability: Texas-based agricultural and oilfield workers and NYC-based adjunct instructors and delivery workers. I find that rather than adopting one dominant individualizing story, as previous research suggests, workers instead move between what I call positioning stories : narratives that interpret their work’s particular structural features. In doing so, workers combine individualistic and structural frames to cope with their positional uncertainty. Depending on the specific tempo and geography of their work, workers account for spatial instability in stories about sacrifice and self-improvement; they interpret temporal instability in stories about addiction and the burden of time passing without progress. Workers combine these with stories highlighting meaning and exploitation in their labor process. These findings reveal how structural precarity impedes a cohesive narrative by disrupting identities and life projects, but it also undermines the credibility of individualistic accounts.

In this study, we examine how respondents belonging to the majority group react to information about demographic shifts, and how these shifts affect group boundaries using a survey experiment in Germany. Our results show that exposure to information about either a growing number of immigrants in general or specifically Muslims increases perceptions of threat among majority group members. This leads them to more frequently categorize individuals with ambiguous German / Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) features as likely having a migration background, particularly when the information specifically highlights the demographic increase of the Muslim population. However, the contraction of the group boundary in response to this information is modest. Further, the perceived status threat associated with demographic shifts leads to an increase in negative sentiments towards individuals perceived to have MENA physical characteristics.

Existing experimental research has struggled to distinguish these two channels. In a nationwide field experiment in Switzerland (paired applications to over 5,700 proprietors), we find evidence of discrimination against apartment seekers with Turkish and Kosovar names (i.e. distant minorities) while individuals with names from neighbouring countries (i.e. close minorities) are not discriminated against. Requests with more information generally receive more invitations, but the effect of this increased invitation rate is similar across minority groups. We find that adding more information does not reduce discrimination as such, as many previous studies have been claiming, but that the kind of information provided matters: while offering additional information about employment status reduces discrimination for individuals with Kosovar and Turkish names, signalling naturalisation does not lead to less discrimination.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso_a_00034","doi":"10.1162/euso_a_00034","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.6311,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Increasing Work Intensity to Improve Economic Well-being. An Analysis Across European Countries","authors":"Claudia Colombarolli","abstract":"This paper examines the impact of year-to-year increases in work intensity on economic well-being across European countries. Work intensity may rise through an increased number of months worked or the exit of dependent adult children. This study examines the differences between these two mechanisms. Both objective and subjective economic well-being are considered, namely, income levels and perceived ability to make ends meet. The analysis draws on 2010-2019 EU-SILC longitudinal data, focusing on individuals in households with adult children. It shows that, as work intensity increases from one year to the next, improvements in objective economic well-being are generally greater than those in subjective economic well-being. Both mechanisms are found to be relevant in improving income levels, especially if they occur simultaneously. The exit of dependent adult children proves effective in improving the perceived ability to make ends meet in some countries, but not all. Investing in quality employment could thus offer dual advantages, supporting young adults' transition to adulthood and improving their parents' economic well-being. In Southern European countries, households struggle to boost their work intensity from one year to the next, yet increased work intensity has a substantial impact on improving economic well-being there.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso_a_00037","doi":"10.1162/euso_a_00037","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.5261,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Sociotechnical imaginaries of social inequality in the design and use of AI recruitment technology","authors":"Laura Sartori, Clementine Collett","abstract":"Through interviewing 12 companies in Italy which either design (vendors) or use (clients) AI recruitment technology systems, we explore how these companies perceive their systems to interact with issues of social inequality and how these perceptions, in practice, carry societal impacts. Three sociotechnical imaginaries (Jasanoff and Kim, 2015) were consistently embedded within these companies’ visions of this intersection: the third eye, the river, and the car bonnet. Through critically analysing these imaginaries, we find that they exhibit an overriding desire for productivity and talent capture from clients, and a consequential de-prioritisation of addressing social inequality and scrutinising the ways it could be reproduced from both vendors and clients. It demonstrates that the current ‘desired’ futures, shown by the sociotechnical imaginaries which vendors and clients share for AI-tec-tech are really leading us towards an ‘undesirable’ future of hiring which continues to perpetuate social inequality.

Instruction-tuning the latest generative LLMs expands the scope of text classification, enabling applications to more complex tasks than previously feasible.

Despite growing evidence that predicted and observed behavior are often not interchangeable , there is limited guidance on using LLMs to obtain valid estimates of causal effects and other parameters. We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design . This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate—and extend—prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations.

Empirical investigations of individual mobility effects, however, have been hindered by one fundamental limitation, the unidentifiability of mobility effects when origin and destination are held constant. Given this fundamental limitation, we propose to reconceptualize mobility effects from the micro- to macro-level. Instead of micro-level mobility effects, the primary focus of the past literature, we ask alternative research questions about macro-level mobility effects: What happens to the population distribution of an outcome if we manipulate the mobility regime, that is, if we alter the observed association between social origin and social destination? We relate individual-level mobility experience to macro-level mobility effects under special interventions. The proposed method bridges the macro and micro agendas in social stratification research, and has wider applications in social stratification beyond the study of mobility effects. We illustrate the method with two analyses that evaluate the impact of social mobility on average fertility and income inequality in the United States.

Yet, social network research generally conceptualizes identities as sociodemographic categories and seldom considers the inherently continuous and heterogeneous nature of differences. Drawing upon the infracategorical model of inequality, this study demonstrates that a computational approach – combining machine learning and exponential random graph models (ERGMs) – can capture the role of categorical conformity in network structures. Through a case study of gender segregation in friendships, this study presents a workflow for developing a machine-learning-based gender conformity measure and applying it to guide the social network analysis of cultural matching. Results show that adolescents with similar gender conformity are more likely to form friendships, net of homophily based on categorical gender and other controls, and homophily by gender conformity mediates homophily by categorical gender. The study concludes by discussing the limitations of this computational approach and its unique strengths in enhancing theories on categories, boundaries, and stratification.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00491241251321152","doi":"10.1177/00491241251321152","journal_full":"Sociological Methods & Research","dist":0.4903,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Correcting the Measurement Errors of AI-Assisted Labeling in Image Analysis Using Design-Based Supervised Learning","authors":"Alessandra Rister Portinari Maranca, Jihoon Chung, Musashi Hinck, Adam D.

Yet three barriers still stand in the way: the tedious labor of manual text annotation, the technical complexity that keeps these tools out of reach for many researchers, and, perhaps most critically, the challenge of bridging the gap between sophisticated algorithms and the deep theoretical understanding social scientists have already developed about human interactions, social structures, and institutions. To counter these limitations, we propose an approach to large-scale text analysis that requires substantially less human-labeled data, and no machine learning expertise, and efficiently integrates the social scientist into critical steps in the workflow. This approach, which allows the detection of statements in text, relies on large language models pre-trained for natural language inference, and a “few-shot” threshold-tuning algorithm rooted in active learning principles.

We find that job titles produce smaller estimates of within job pay gaps than job groups, but the inferential importance of job concepts differs across organizational, workplace, and job groups within workplace units of observation. Moving from more to less job concept detail, we find almost no inference differences when pay gaps are estimated at the organizational level. Tradeoffs at the workplace and job groups within workplace levels are more common, comprising around 10 percent to 20 percent of observations. A legal theoretical framework leads to fewer empirical estimates of significant pay disparities, while comparable worth estimates suggest higher levels of gender and racial bias at the job and workplace levels.

Drawing on a narrative-integrative methodology, the paper synthesizes grey literature, government policy, institutional reports, and verified academic sources to critically assess how Singapore constructs and governs its carbon market platform. The analysis is structured around three interrelated questions: (1) how Singapore builds its institutional and financial infrastructure to mediate carbon flows; (2) how public and private actors coordinate to establish authority and credibility within a hybrid governance model; and (3) how the platform-based architecture produces both opportunities and asymmetries across the ASEAN region. Conceptually, the paper engages with theories of platform capitalism, soft market regulation, and green financial intermediation to interpret Singapore’s infrastructural strategy. The findings suggest that Singapore’s market-oriented approach—anchored by mechanisms such as Climate Impact X, Article 6 bilateral agreements, and green financial instruments—functions not only as a facilitator of decarbonization but also as a gatekeeper of regional participation. While this model enables cross-border interoperability and enhances access to global climate finance, it also introduces risks of institutional dependency and normative concentration.

Presidents face unexpected challenges related to stochastic events such as scandals, policy failures or economic crises. We argue that the termination of ministers who have received calls for their resignation presents an opportunity for the president to send signals to the electorate in the expectation of a corrective effect on popularity through a blame-shifting dynamic. The central argument is that this dynamic only occurs in coalition governments where political responsibility may be more easily attributed to the coalition’s different parties and factions, weakening personalisation centred on the president and facilitating blame-shifting and the corrective effect. The expectation of a corrective effect on approval is tested using instrumental variables (IV) regressions applied to novel data on ministerial terminations and resignation calls in 124 governments in 12 presidential democracies. The data were gathered by combining data mining, machine learning techniques and survey marginal time series based on the dyad ratios algorithm for approval. The main findings support the expectation that individual terminations of tainted ministers generate a corrective effect of nine points on presidential approval in coalition governments, which decreases in the medium and long term.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/37ruy_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/37ruy_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.458,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Needs for Security and Certainty Relate Differently to Support for Universal Basic Income Versus Other Social Safety Net Programs Across European Nations","authors":"Christopher Federico, Caitlyn Barrett","abstract":"Needs for security and certainty (NSC) vary in their relationship with economic preferences as a function of political engagement.

Examining comparative European public opinion, we argue that this ‘reversal’ is less applicable to universal basic income (UBI), since the latter is an unconditional benefit that detaches welfare provision from specific situations of risk (e.g., unemployment insurance). This should shift individuals to think of provision in terms of moral hazard (e.g., work avoidance) in the context of UBI.

While the consociational model is widely credited with stabilizing the state and ensuring minority inclusion, it has also contributed to the institutional entrenchment of ethnic segmentation, shaping the incentives of political competition and governance. The article introduces the concept of ethnopolitical cartelization to describe how consociational power-sharing facilitates the consolidation of dominant ethnic parties as gatekeepers to state institutions, limiting intra-ethnic pluralism while preserving interethnic parity. Drawing on institutional analysis and empirical evidence, the article argues that key features of the Macedonian model, such as ethnic veto mechanisms, proportionality rules, and decentralized governance, have incentivized the monopolization of political representation within ethnic blocs, most clearly exemplified in the long-standing dominance of DUI within the Albanian political segment. This dynamic has enabled the development of vertically integrated party structures that channel access to state resources through identity-based patronage and informal governance. The result is a form of segmented stability in which public administration, education, and language policy operate through parallel structures. The Macedonian case illustrates the broader limitations of consociational design in deeply divided societies: while formal inclusion is achieved, it may come at the expense of shared civic space, horizontal accountability, and democratic responsiveness. By segmenting political authority and embedding elite brokerage into the structure of governance, the system inadvertently entrenches the very boundaries it was designed to overcome.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9jg3t_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9jg3t_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5275,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Local Politics of Social Investment Under Fiscal Constraints: The Case of Childcare Expansion in Germany","authors":"Erik Neimanns, Björn Bremer","abstract":"Embedded in a broader discourse on future-oriented social policy and the idea of a social investment welfare state, governments in many of the advanced economies expanded childcare in recent years. Yet, in many countries considerable regional variation exists in coverage rates and expansion efforts, and often the supply of childcare still does not match demand. In this paper, we explore the politics of this regional variation by studying Germany, a country which had relatively low rates of childcare coverage for a long time, but recently introduced a legal entitlement to childcare. Despite this legal entitlement, we argue that local political and economic factors (continue to) matter for childcare expansion. We expect left-wing local political majorities to be associated with stronger expansion dynamics. At the same time, tight local fiscal constraints, which are widespread in Germany’s fiscal federalism, should limit partisan room for maneuver and party effects, and should slow down expansion. Analyzing local-level data on childcare coverage rates, socio-economic context factors and government partisanship, we find empirical support for our expectations. Building on these findings, we furthermore examine how local governments reconcile gaps in childcare provision with the legal entitlement to childcare and what distributive consequences this has.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9yrp2_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9yrp2_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5457,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Regulating land markets to achieve the EU sustainability agenda","authors":"Adam Calo, Sylvia Kay, Eliaz Moreau","abstract":"Rethinking the regulation of land markets is central to the agroecological transition in Europe. The EU has bold, evidenced-based policy objectives for food system and environmental transformation. Yet, absent a parallel process for regulating land, these policy objectives will remain watered down or impossible to obtain. The EU has shown commitments to invest in environmental policy experimentation because it knows the future wellbeing of the continent depends on sound land use management. However, there is no parallel movement towards reimagining European land governance. This status quo imperils the EU green agenda and threatens the legitimacy of desperately needed environmental policy. Identifying enticing policy options to inspire new land governance can help fulfil existing EU sustainability commitments and open meaningful pathways to scale agroecology. This research first uses existing evidence from the literature to show how current European land markets—governed by the main freedoms of the EU treaties—weakens the capacity to achieve generational renewal, the vitality of rural areas, and land based biodiversity maintenance. Then we reveal existing and potential opportunities for European land market regulation. Through this analysis we argue that agricultural land is a blind spot in European policies for the transition to agroecology, and thus reframe land regulation as an enabling tool to install young and new farmers, facilitate biodiverse landscapes, and build durable rural economies. Measures like transparency in land markets, public acquisition of agricultural land, establishing a first right of refusal, and taxation to facilitate access to land may unlock land for a new generation of agroecological farmers. Exploration of these policy cases calls for an imaginative expansion of public action on land markets to tackle food system challenges, and is aimed directly at policy makers.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ajh4v_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ajh4v_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.394,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The synergy between the People, Border and the State at the Indo-Bangladesh Borderlands in India: an Anthropological review of the Developmental and the Local-Governance actions of the state arising at the praxis.","authors":"Kaustav Ghosh Roy","abstract":"Borderlands are geographic places demarcated and defined by the state designed boundaries and the borderlands of Indo-Bangladesh region have been a subject to scarce politico-economic investments stemming from regional complications including security concerns.

Many migration scholars would like to find ways to mobilize their knowledge to resist migrants’ human rights violations. Despite increased focus on research impact, border violence is only increasing. On the one hand, policy makers do not act on scholarly recommendations that are highly critical, but not necessarily actionable. On the other hand, when scholarly recommendations are actionable, legal and policy changes do not necessarily result in meaningful improvements for refugees’ and other migrants’ dignity. As a result, there is a dichotomy between applied research that is not critical and critical research that is not actionable. Against this backdrop, this article explores how migration researchers can reclaim the meaning of impact and smuggle critique into the term. The article is based on auto-biographical explorations of what it means for an anthropologist to produce knowledge on migration from within law faculties and as policy officer and research consultant for human and refugee rights organizations. Based on this material, the article argues that migration scholars who seek justice should not produce more evidence, but rather take law seriously as a knowledge practice. The article develops three design principles for migration scholars who seek to resist in the short- and medium-term migration laws and policies that violate human right principles. First, build knowledge alliances with justice actors. Second, theorize knowledge needs in justice claims.

The proposed refinement enhances the practical applicability of the NAP in complex multi-agent scenarios, offering libertarian societies a coherent framework for ethically and legally addressing immediate situations of aggression through consensual collective action.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s8wdm_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/s8wdm_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4069,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Voting for Hard Eurosceptic Parties in 2024 European Parliament Elections in the Czech Republic: The Role of Salience and Attitude toward Czexit","authors":"Ivan Petrúšek, Ales Kudrnáč, Alexander John Mahesh Davenport, Ákos Bocskor","abstract":"In this article, we test the applicability of the EU issue voting model to the case of the 2024 Czech European Parliament elections. Given the increasing importance of the issue of leaving or remaining in the European Union, we examine whether voters’ attitudes towards this issue affect their electoral behaviour. Furthermore, research on individual-level salience's effects on EU issue voting is limited. To address this gap, we leverage post-election survey data on the importance voters attribute to the issue of leaving the EU to assess whether salience influences turnout and moderates the effect of voter preferences on party choice. We show that voters who judge the issue of Czexit to be highly salient are less likely to abstain. Additionally, we find that in general, voters’ attitudes regarding Czexit exert only a weak effect on their decision to support parties that reflect their views on this issue. However, we find that this effect is moderated to a large degree by the salience that voters attribute to the issue, in that voters considering the question of Czexit to be highly salient are considerably more likely to support parties that match their preferences (i.e. Czexit supporters vote for hard Eurosceptic parties and remain supporters for non-hard Eurosceptic parties). Thus, the study concludes that voter behaviour largely follows an EU issue voting logic, highlighting the key role played by issue salience in this process.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/teydb_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/teydb_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5697,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The Risk and Risk-free Rate of T-bills","authors":"George Y. Nie","abstract":"We argue that a payment’s risk approaches zero as maturity approaches zero, and that the central bank’s short-term rate best captures the risk-free rate of various assets. We employ two factors to model the expected risk-free rate that the market expects the current monetary policy to move towards the neutral rate over a certain period. Expecting that the T-bill risk (i.e., the macrorisk) largely reflects a country’s inflation risk, we measure the risk as a 5-year payment’s risk to be comparable across assets. We use repeated trials to minimize the prediction errors to solve the model factors. Our models thus split US and Canada T-bill yields into the risk and risk-free rate, on average explaining 98.8% of the returns. The models assuming the return independence even show stronger power in predicting T-bill returns. We also find that a negative risk of several basis points, which is constant over maturity, probably reflects the transaction cost or the risk of inter-back short-term lending. The risk and the risk-free rate represent the gateway to the risks of various corporate assets in the country.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2dazg_v4","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/2dazg_v4","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.2744,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The evolution of cooperation in the supply chain on generalized networks with a single output","authors":"Md Sams Afif Nirjhor, Fangyue Liu, Mayuko Nakamaru","abstract":"A general supply chain is a division of labor of an arbitrary number of subtasks, which has asymmetric interactions among the subtask-holder groups. To sustain a supply chain, cooperation among the subtask-holders is a must. We construct a general network model of supply chain with a finite number of roles with a single output, where the supply of faulty products is possible and a supply chain never stops on the way. We consider that cooperators and defectors exist in each subtask-holder group in a supply chain; cooperators of a subtask-holder group pay a cost of cooperation to maintain and upgrade the quality of the product, defectors however do not pay any cost, and thus the product quality reduces. In some supply chains, more cooperators upgrade the quality of the product more, and players can obtain a better reputation defined as a bonus that is given to all players. We found that the supply chain with a bonus confronts the social dilemma. We make replicator equations of asymmetric games to investigate the evolution of cooperation in a supply chain. We found that not the benefit from supply but the cost of cooperation influences the dynamics. As a result, the network structure of the supply chain never influences the dynamics. Sanction on the defectors induces the evolution of cooperation and non-linear bonus functions promote co-existences of cooperator groups and defector groups. The bonus functions determine whether the length of the supply chain promotes the evolution of cooperation or not.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3679n_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/3679n_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3045,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Introdução ao fascículo dedicado a Paul Krugman da coleção “Os economistas simplificados”","authors":"Felipe Pait, Heloisa Pait","abstract":"Nesse artigo fazemos uma introdução aos trabalhos do economista Paul Krugman, apresentando suas contribuições à ciência e seus artigos de divulgação que são objetos de polêmicas.

Mechanisms that generate gains from integration, such as external economies of scale and specialization, also increase the hegemon’s power because in equilibrium they make other relationships poor substitutes for those with a global hegemon. Other countries can implement economic security policies to shape their economies in order to insulate themselves from undue foreign pressure. Countries considering these policies face a tradeoff between gains from trade and economic security. While an individual country can make itself better off, uncoordinated attempts by multiple countries to limit their dependency on the hegemon via economic security policies lead to inefficient fragmentation of the global financial and trade system. We study financial services as a leading application both as tools of coercion and an industry with strong strategic complementarities. We estimate that U.S. geoeconomic power relies on financial services, while Chinese power relies on manufacturing. Since power is nonlinear and increases disproportionally as the hegemon approaches controlling the entire supply of a sectoral input, we estimate that much economic security could be achieved with little overall fragmentation by diversifying the input sources of key sectors currently controlled by the hegemons.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j8wgx_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/j8wgx_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4573,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"7-digit Product-level Supply-Use and Input-Output Tables Using ASI Data","authors":"Sourish  Dutta","abstract":"This paper constructs 7-digit product Supply-Use Tables (SUTs) and symmetric Input-Output Tables (IOTs) for the Indian economy using microdata from the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) for the period 2016-2021.

In keeping with that idea, mental health refers to a person's physical autonomy, sense of competence in reaching their intellectual and emotional potential, ability to manage the stresses of everyday life, and ability to contribute to their community. According to recent studies, India has the largest tribal populations in the world, and a sizable portion of these people suffer from a variety of mental health conditions. The state of mental health conditions among India's tribal groups and their collective capacity, based on their knowledge and beliefs, to address the new issues that are causing an increase in mental health problems among themselves are discussed in the following article. Previous studies have also indicated that each tribal society's unique and distinctive culture has influenced how they interpret mental health concerns, which has helped them develop different approaches to managing or treating them. According to earlier studies, the authorities frequently force their policies and choices on tribal groups without consulting them. This has resulted in a number of obstacles that prevent the tribal groups from effectively managing particular mental health-related illnesses. Therefore, the essay that follows makes the case that a belief-based, culturally unique approach to the effective and long-term screening and treatment of mental health-related problems and disorders among the vulnerable can be seen as a feasible substitute in the future.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/37c6k_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/37c6k_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3161,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Crisis Vulnerability and Social Stratification: Educational Inequalities in Political Trust Dynamics During the COVID-19 Pandemic","authors":"Gundula Zoch, Steffen Wamsler","abstract":"Educational disparities in political attitudes are well-documented, yet the mechanisms underlying these inequalities remain underexplored.

Results from linear regression models with individual fixed-effects reveal a sharp and statistically significant initial trust increase, particularly among lower-educated individuals and for institutional trust. As the pandemic progresses, trust declines below pre-crisis levels, with somewhat more pronounced changes among lower-educated individuals. Infection rates, restriction measures or changes in individual objective and subjective pandemic affectedness do not substantively explain educational disparities but mediate both increases and decreases in trust among both groups. From a broader perspective, the results point towards the importance of selective containment measures as well as subjective negative economic and social consequences that are likely to shape attitudinal change in times of crises.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3wbzv_v3","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/3wbzv_v3","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5712,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Millennials as a Demographic Bridge to Diversity? Segregation and Diversity of Young Adult Neighborhoods","authors":"Noli Brazil, Jennifer Candipan","abstract":"As young adults, the Millennial generation arrived as the largest and most racially and ethnically diverse generation in U.S. history. These unique demographic characteristics, along with more progressive self-reported views on racial and ethnic issues, have prompted some to label this generation as a demographic bridge to America’s diverse future. This article examines whether these unique characteristics translate into greater neighborhood racial diversity and integration. Specifically, this study sets out to answer whether Millennial young adult neighborhoods are more racially and ethnically diverse and located in less segregated metropolitan areas than the young adult neighborhoods of prior generations. Using 1990-2019 Census and American Community Survey data, we find a mixed story. On the one hand, young adult White Early Millennials were living in neighborhoods with similar or slightly higher diversity levels, and metropolitan areas with similar or slightly lower segregation levels compared to White young adults in prior generations. On the other hand, young adult White Late Millennials tend to live in more segregated neighborhoods, and in most cases, their segregation levels surpass those for White young adult Gen Xers. These mixed findings provide moderate support for the perspective that the Millennial generation is a bridge to diversity, albeit not the final destination. There is evidence of positive changes towards residential racial integration, but resilience in segregated patterns still remain.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4jbre_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/4jbre_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5423,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Labor market formation in the hydrogen economy: A cross-country comparison between sectoral and regional recruitment patterns in Denmark, Norway and Sweden","authors":"Hans Hellsmark, Viktor Jonsson Rosenberg, Tuukka Mäkitie, Elin Folkesson","abstract":"The emergence of the hydrogen economy is expected to play a central role in industrial decarbonization, yet little is known about how hydrogen transitions shape labor markets across sectors and regions. This paper examines the formation of hydrogen-related labor markets in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, using job postings as a proxy for recruitment activity. Drawing on socio-technical systems theory and cluster analysis, we identify emerging configurations of actors, competences, and regional specializations. Data was collected from national job portals between August 2023 and September 2024 and analyzed using unsupervised machine learning. Six labor market clusters were identified, showing distinct combinations of recruiting organizations, sectoral focus, and geographical distribution. Engineering jobs—comprising over 40% of the dataset—were also examined in a separate cluster analysis, revealing variation in recruitment needs across technical disciplines and national contexts. Findings suggest that labor market formation is deeply shaped by prior industrial specializations and policy frameworks. Norway’s labor market reflects its offshore energy legacy, dominated by consulting and engineering firms. Denmark shows a capital-concentrated, research-driven pattern, while Sweden’s job creation is led by large incumbents, particularly in energy utilities. The study demonstrates how labor market data can serve as an empirical window into early-stage socio-technical configurations in sustainability transitions. It highlights the potential of combining digital trace data and machine learning to understand regional, sectoral, and competence dynamics in emerging green economies. This approach advances the study of sectoral labor dynamics in energy transitions and offers tools for informing cross-sectoral policy and workforce planning.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4m3kg_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/4m3kg_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4317,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Evaluating the Role of Social Capital in Post-Disaster Agricultural Recovery Using Satellite Remote Sensing","authors":"Yamaguchi Yuhei, Lyu Zeyu","abstract":"The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of social capital on disaster mitigation and recovery in agriculture. Agriculture not only serves as a means of food production but also provides various ecosystem services to human society. Human society relies on these ecosystem services, and for the realization of a sustainable society, it is essential that agriculture continues even after disasters. This study focused on the role of social capital in disaster mitigation and recovery. Social capital is known to contribute to population recovery and improvements in mental health after disasters. However, its relationship with the recovery of industries such as agriculture has not been extensively studied. This study examines the impact of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that struck the Noto Peninsula, Japan on January 1, 2024. Using satellite remote sensing, we quantified the effects of the disaster on rice paddy utilization at a micro-geographic level and explored its relationship with social capital. Specifically, we used the annual frequency of village meetings as the proxy variable for social capital and analyze whether differences in meeting frequency influenced post-disaster rice paddy utilization based on a kernel matching with Gaussian process regression. Controlling for potential confounding variables, we found no significant difference in rice paddy utilization associated with variations in meeting frequency. Although social capital is widely regarded as an important factor for disaster mitigation and recovery, our analysis did not find a significant association between social capital and the recovery or mitigation of agricultural land use. This study not only contributes to the theoretical development of social capital but also serves as a pioneering example of applying satellite remote sensing in social science research, demonstrating the significance of this innovative methodology.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5zrhq_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/5zrhq_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4472,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Constructing Segregation: Examining Social and Spatial Division in Road Networks","authors":"Elizabeth Roberto, Yu Zhu, Santiago Segarra, Jaleh Jalili","abstract":"Racism, discriminatory practices, institutional bias, and systematic exclusion can take lasting physical form in the built environment.

We demonstrate the empirical application of the method by analyzing differences in racial composition and residential segregation for the observed and counterfactual road networks of five U.S. cities. We find that unexpected disconnectivity in a city's road network is associated with greater differences in the racial composition of nearby areas and higher levels of segregation at the local and city level. Our findings suggest that road networks warrant more attention as a factor that may contribute to the persistence of segregation.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ajtnp_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/ajtnp_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4888,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Collectivity and agency for hope to progress anti-racist change in the academy","authors":"Manny Madriaga","abstract":"Despair is global antiblackness manifesting itself in our universities.

We find compelling evidence for acculturation processes: socially mobile individuals’ health outcomes are largely shaped by both their class of origin and destination, with limited evidence of additional, independent mobility effects. The only exception is women experiencing upward intragenerational mobility, who benefit from improved self-rated health beyond what is explained by their origin and destination class (0.10 higher, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.20). Across outcomes, psychological wellbeing, psychological distress, and life satisfaction are strongly tied to destination class, whereas physical health and health behaviours remain closely tied to origin class.

Most often, the term is understood as a reference to the material requirements of publishing relentlessly in order to make or advance a career in contemporary academia. In this article, I show that Publish or Perish is also a cultural narrative that provides a formal rationalistic solution to the uncertainty of early career scholars. Funds are scarce, competition is fierce, the individual future within academia is unknown—the Publish or Perish narrative claims that if you just keep publishing, you can overcome these obstacles. This narrative is perpetuated among aspiring scholars and creates peer pressure where it exerts its power to a certain extent regardless of material requirements, especially in the humanities. Based on extensive discussion of literature and data from a qualitative study with humanities scholars in Germany and the UK, employing a cultural sociological approach, I trace the meaning of Publish or Perish as this narrative. I look at how it is passed on among early career scholars, and how senior scholars respond to it in situations of mentorship and supervision. This perspective emphasizes the importance of everyday situations that trigger anxiety, as well as the importance of mentorship as a crucial means of reducing such anxiety. This is pertinent to reforms of evaluation practices that tend to abstract from such mundane situations. The notion of the slippery slope (Hartmut Rosa) helps comprehend this anxiety.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dt2m3_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/dt2m3_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4509,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Educational Assortative Mating and Singlehood in the United States: Past, Present, and Future Projections","authors":"Elena Maria Pojman","abstract":"The United States has undergone dramatic shifts in education over the last 60 years, with a rapid expansion of college attainment and the reversal of the gender gap in education, but their impact on educational assortative mating is unclear. Educational assortative mating shapes the distribution of resources within and between families, thereby influencing gender and family inequality. Though some scholars have posited that the decline in couples in which men have the educational advantage reflects “the end of hypergamy,” broader partnership trends complicate this narrative. Without understanding how educational expansion, women’s advantage in attainment, and increased singlehood contribute to trends in assortative mating, I argue such speculation is premature. I take a long-term perspective on the role these factors played in changing educational assortative mating and singlehood and assess whether shifts in population composition influence the future of partnership and singlehood. I present estimates of hypergamy, homogamy, hypogamy, and singlehood between 1960-2020 and leverage multi-dimensional population projections that incorporate educational attainment to estimate six future scenarios of change through 2050. Findings suggest the strong possibility of mating squeezes due to mismatches between men and women’s educational attainment and partnership preferences.

This paper defines and critically explores this risk, conceptualizing it as a socio-technical process where users, interacting with algorithmic systems (especially powerful generative AI), under specific conditions (e.g., strong efficiency pressures, lack of critical awareness, opaque system design, platform incentives favoring predictability [H], workplace surveillance and performance metrics), may gradually and non-autonomously narrow their thinking patterns, expressive range, and value considerations to align with perceived algorithmic affordances or limitations, often operating below full conscious reflection. Crucially, this potential non-autonomous cognitive narrowing, partly facilitated by AI's computational nature (pattern dependence, lack of deep understanding [P]), poses a specific threat to capabilities associated with \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F], such as cognitive independence, nuanced creativity, and critical reflection. Drawing upon critical theory, STS, labor process theory, governmentality studies, media studies, and cognitive science, this paper analyzes potential mechanisms (efficiency heuristics, pattern fixation risks amplified by AI's computational nature [P], cognitive offloading trade-offs, effects of algorithmic governance [H]) and discusses theoretically deduced multi-level consequences (potential erosion of cognitive independence/ER [F], risks to cultural diversity [A], societal concerns). Acknowledging that users are active agents who strategically adapt, learn, and resist, the paper emphasizes how structural factors (including platform incentives, power dynamics [H], and managerial rationalities) and system design can nevertheless create conditions conducive to domestication risks. It distinguishes this potential negative pathway from beneficial, autonomous adaptation and skill acquisition. Finally, it proposes multi-level strategies focused on fostering critical awareness, metacognition, and human-centered design prioritizing user agency (as advocated in HAC [L]) and long-term well-being to mitigate risks and safeguard ER [N], while highlighting the need for empirical research investigating the conditions under which domestication occurs and the effectiveness of counter-domestication strategies. This paper aims to raise critical awareness of the potential specter of algorithmic domestication, advocating for reflective design and proactive mitigation within the EST framework [R].

However, the initial formulation risks ethnocentrism if not critically examined across cultures. This paper deeply explores the complex tension between the potential universality of the capacities underlying ER and its culturally specific manifestations and valuations. It first reviews biological and psychological evidence supporting a potential universal basis for the human potential for ER dimensions (e.g., meaning-seeking drive, basic affective systems, cognitive creativity), while carefully refining the connotation of \"redundancy\" as beyond immediate, instrumental needs. Subsequently, the core part focuses on comparatively analyzing (based primarily on secondary literature, acknowledging inherent limitations) the significant differences in the concrete manifestations, cultural meanings, and value priorities of key ER dimensions across diverse cultural backgrounds, moving beyond simple dichotomies (like individualistic vs. collectivistic) to incorporate nuanced insights from comparative philosophy and anthropology. Furthermore, the paper explores the interactive mechanisms between universal human potentials and specific cultural environments (including language, social structures, and ecological contexts) that co-shape the diverse expressions of ER, considering the complex impacts of globalization and global power structures [H]. Building on this comparison, the paper undertakes profound theoretical reflection, critically examining potential Western-centric biases within the initial ER concept [F], acknowledging the risks of constructing overly simplistic universal theories, and exploring pathways towards developing ER as a more culturally sensitive meta-framework, explicitly incorporating relationality and contextuality. Methodological challenges for future cross-cultural ER research are discussed. This paper argues that cross-cultural scrutiny of ER is essential for refining the concept, enhancing its validity and applicability (e.g., in [N], [G]), avoiding cultural misinterpretation and epistemic violence, and promoting genuine cross-cultural understanding within the broader context of navigating human-AI relations [P].","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kbefc_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/kbefc_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4613,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"[H] From \"Tool\" to \"Niche Partner\": An Ecological Turn for AI Ethics","authors":"Kwok, Yiu Hung","abstract":"Traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI) ethics primarily focuses on AI either as a tool to be designed (emphasizing principles like fairness, transparency, accountability - FAccT) or as a potential adversary to be controlled (focusing on alignment, existential risk). While essential, this individual-centric ethical perspective faces significant limitations in grasping the systemic, relational, dynamic, and long-term impacts of AI as it deeply embeds within society, particularly within the complex political economies and power structures that shape its development and deployment. This paper argues for the necessity and value of complementing existing frameworks with an \"ecological turn\" for AI ethics, drawing critically on niche construction theory, technophenomenology, distributed cognition, complex systems thinking, and crucially, integrating deep insights from Science and Technology Studies (STS), critical political economy, sociology, and postcolonial theory. It critiques the limitations of solely relying on traditional perspectives when addressing deep human-AI integration and co-evolutionary dynamics (as explored in HAC [L]). The ecological perspective reframes AI not merely as an instrument but metaphorically as a key actor—a **\"niche partner\" or \"environment engineer\"**¹—whose significant shaping capacity stems from its computational abilities [P] but whose deployment, goals, operational logic, and effects are inextricably linked with embedded and contested power structures (e.g., platform capitalism, surveillance capitalism, state interests, geopolitical dynamics, control over data flows and critical infrastructure) demanding rigorous critical attention. This reframing highlights how AI actively shapes human cognitive, social, and cultural niches, often in ways that reproduce or exacerbate existing inequalities and create novel forms of algorithmic governance and social sorting. Building on this structurally informed analysis, rooted in a critique of platform power and surveillance capitalism, the paper outlines an ecological framework as a complementary lens for AI ethics. It explores potential multi-dimensional considerations for assessing human-AI-environment ecosystem dynamics and overall well-being (termed \"health\" heuristically, encompassing cognitive diversity [potentially threatened by P'], cultural resilience [A], social capital, cognitive autonomy, the space for Existential Redundancy (ER) [F] (understood in its phenomenological and biological depth), system adaptability, social equity, and environmental sustainability), explicitly acknowledging the immense operationalization challenges and positioning these considerations primarily as ways to inform and enrich the application of established principles [N] and human rights frameworks. It explores ecological governance principles (regulation focusing on dynamics, adaptation, systemic responsibility, structural interventions such as robust antitrust enforcement, democratic data governance models, public options for infrastructure, and participatory mechanisms, complementing individual accountability), emphasizing their potential to enhance existing governance approaches [I] and highlighting implementation challenges, political contestation, and the deep-seated nature of structural barriers. This paper argues that the ecological turn provides a vital analytical framework and critical perspective for understanding AI's long-term, systemic impacts and fostering sustainable, just, and human-flourishing coexistence within the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R], thereby offering necessary theoretical depth and practical foresight to complement and strengthen existing ethical governance paradigms.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kmcx2_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/kmcx2_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4281,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Can we estimate crisis death tolls by subtracting population estimates? A critical review and appraisal","authors":"Hampton Gaddy, Maria Gargiulo","abstract":"Background: In the absence of high-quality data, the death tolls of epidemics, conflicts, and disasters are often estimated using ad hoc methods. One understudied class of methods, which we term the growth rate discontinuity method (GRDM), estimates death tolls by projecting pre-crisis and post-crisis total population estimates using crude growth rates and then subtracting the results. Despite, or perhaps due to, its simplicity, this method is the source of prominent death toll estimates for the Black Death, the 1918 influenza pandemic, the Great Chinese Famine, and the Rwandan genocide, among others. Objective: In this article, we review the influence and validity of GRDM and its applications. Methods: Using statistical simulation and comparison with better-validated demographic methods, we assess the accuracy, precision, and biases of this method for estimating mortality in absolute and relative terms. Results: We find that existing GRDM estimates often misestimate death tolls by large, unpredictable margins. Simulations suggest this is because GRDM requires precision in its inputs to an extent rarely possible in the contexts of interest. Conclusions: If there is sufficient data to specify GRDM well, it is probably possible to also use a more reliable method; if there is not sufficient data, GRDM estimates are so sensitive to their assumptions that they cannot be considered informative. Contribution: These findings question the empirical suitability of existing demographic and econometric work that has used GRDM to analyse mortality crises. They also underscore the need for improved data collection in crisis settings and the utility of qualitative methods in contexts where quantification using better-validated methods is not possible.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nrpb3_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/nrpb3_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.413,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"In the Fog of (Gender) Inequalities in Science: The Forest or the Trees?

This paper proposes a theoretical perspective examining AI's dual role, acting metaphorically as both a potential catalyst for novelty and a significant filter shaping cultural transmission, with impacts extending far beyond mere efficiency gains. Drawing critically on cultural evolution theory, social network analysis, and computational social science (using concepts like 'variation' and 'selection' heuristically, while emphasizing human agency and AI's computational nature [P]), this paper analyzes the mechanisms through which AI can, depending on its design, deployment context (shaped by political economy [H]), and crucially, human interaction and interpretation, influence the introduction of new cultural elements and the propagation of specific cultural traits. It explores the potential long-term dynamical consequences for cultural symbols, narratives, value norms, collective memory, and meaning systems, paying particular attention to potential pressures on dimensions of \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F] (e.g., potentially marginalizing deep meaning generation or diverse aesthetic expression) and acknowledging the significant empirical challenges in isolating AI's causal impact. The paper critically analyzes the risk of \"algorithmic cultural hegemony\"—where platform-controlled algorithms reflecting specific commercial logics and power structures [H] might foster cultural homogenization—emphasizing this as a socio-technical phenomenon contingent on human choices and structural forces, not an autonomous action by AI, while also acknowledging possibilities for resistance, hybridity, and niche formation. Finally, it discusses the necessity, principles, trade-offs, and structural barriers associated with designing more human-controllable, value-sensitive AI systems and implementing governance strategies aimed at fostering healthier, more resilient cultural ecosystems, acknowledging the centrality of human agency (even as it is reshaped) and societal choices in navigating these processes within the broader Existential Symbiosis Theory [R].

Knowledge of these barriers from the faculty’s perspective can be useful in developing ways of integrating and implementing technology in nursing education. Methods: A quantitative study design was used; interviews were conducted with nursing faculty through purposive sampling. The interviews centred on the perceived barriers to the integration of educational technologies. After codifying the data, manual thematic analysis was conducted, and the findings regarding institutional, technical, and pedagogical themes were compiled. Ethical considerations included informed consent, confidentiality, and institutional review board approval. Results: Thematic analysis revealed five main barriers: (1) institutional limitations, such as inadequate infrastructure and training, (2) technical skill gaps among faculty, (3) concerns about the pedagogical effectiveness of technology in skill-based learning, (4) resistance to change, particularly among senior faculty, and (5) perceived impacts on student engagement. Direct quotations from participants illustrated the complexity of these challenges. Conclusions: Overcoming the barriers requires multifaceted assistance with professional development, technological advancements of facilities, and balanced instructional integration of technologies. These results indicate that the faculty’s insights should be taken into account when developing strategies for technology integration and the role of a constructive organizational context regarding the successful implementation of technologies. Subsequent studies should examine these barriers in different regions and incorporate students’ experiences as well to gain a more holistic understanding.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wemr3_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/wemr3_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3382,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"High rates of polygyny do not lock large proportions of men out of the marriage market","authors":"Hampton Gaddy, Laura Fortunato, Rebecca Sear","abstract":"There is a widespread belief, in scholarly literature, the popular press, and even incel ideology, that polygyny prevents many men from marrying, by skewing the sex ratios of marriage markets. In turn, high proportions of men permanently excluded from marriage are thought to lead to negative outcomes, such as increased rates of crime and conflict. We investigate the link between polygyny and unmarried men through a combination of formal demographic modeling and analysis of census data from 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania, plus the historical United States. Our model demonstrates that marriage markets are skewed sufficiently feminine under a range of realistic demographic scenarios to support some level of polygyny without necessarily locking any men out of marriage. In fact, our empirical results show a negative association between the prevalence of polygyny and the prevalence of unmarried men at the sub-national level. This pattern is explained partly by differences in sex ratios across populations and partly by relatively strong pro-marriage norms increasing the overall rate of marriage in polygynous communities. These results challenge the “if one man marries two women, another man will go unmarried” mechanism that is commonly invoked to link polygyny to armed conflict, to argue for the evolutionary fitness of monogamy, and to bolster certain strains of incel ideology.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wtymg_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/wtymg_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4187,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"‘Because like if you feel guilty, then it’s usually a sign’: On the role of emotions in conceptualising infidelity","authors":"Simone Schneider","abstract":"Existing research suggests that people employ fluid understandings of infidelity and conceptualise it in relation to, for example, emotional outcomes rather than as a static set of (physical) behaviours. Seeking to explore the underlying mechanisms of this process, this article examines how emotions are negotiated in conceptualisations and meanings of infidelity. This question is investigated through a thematic analysis of 17 semi-structured interviews with young adults in England who experienced, according to their perspective, infidelity. I show that not only what participants did but also how they or their partner felt was invoked in classifying a practice as infidelity. Namely, emotions serve as a cultural repertoire to negotiate infidelity by drawing on internalised feeling rules in relation to genuine, ‘lived’ feelings. However, the presence and absence of feelings are drawn on differently in that emotions are only invoked in conceptualising what is not infidelity – rather than what it is. Against this background, I argue that we need to examine not only when and why people engage in emotion work but equally when they instead engage in assigning a (new) frame to a practice. By showcasing what people say or think about infidelity as well as their lived experiences, this article underlines the need to explore both discourse and practice – and their interplay – in research on infidelity.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xs24a_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/xs24a_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3925,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Ten design proposals for EdTech: evidence from classroom use.

The increasing prevalence of students using AI for rapid answers and task completion raises significant concerns about learning depth, foundational skill acquisition, and the cultivation of future-ready competencies. This paper argues that merely banning or passively allowing AI use are ineffective responses; a fundamental reshaping of educational goals and paradigms is crucial. It proposes that \"Existential Redundancy\" (ER) [F]—the qualities transcending direct utility that constitute the core of human experiential depth, meaning-making, and value judgment (e.g., meaning generation, intrinsic value judgment, aesthetic appreciation, non-utilitarian creativity, affective depth, existential awareness)—should be positioned as a central value and key objective in future education, complementing the development of higher-order cognitive skills. Adopting an ER perspective derived from the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R], this paper analyzes the severe challenges AI poses to education, particularly the risks of \"intellectual shallowing,\" a potential \"skill gap,\" and the threat of \"algorithmic domestication\" [P'] to students' cognitive autonomy, partly stemming from AI's computational limits [P]. Building on this analysis, it constructs a future learning paradigm for human-AI symbiosis with the dual, mutually reinforcing goals of fostering higher-order cognitive skills and safeguarding/cultivating ER-related capacities [F, N]. This paradigm comprises five interconnected pillar strategies: (1) cultivating critical AI literacy and digital citizenship (understanding AI limits [P] and risks [P']); (2) transforming instructional design (emphasizing \"beyond-AI\" tasks targeting ER [F], while judiciously leveraging AI's assistive potential); (3) innovating assessment methods (prioritizing qualitative, process-oriented approaches for ER-related growth, acknowledging measurement challenges [C]); (4) igniting intrinsic motivation (linking learning to ER [F]); and (5) empowering teachers and providing systemic support (addressing equity challenges [H] and structural barriers).

India is one of the world's most resource-rich countries, with abundant reserves of coal, iron ore, bauxite, and other minerals. NRM is a complex and crucial aspect of sustainable development, and the effective integration of dual production and livestock grazing has emerged as a promising strategy in this domain. This chapter provides an overview of the economic benefits derived from the implementation of these practices, considering the various challenges and opportunities involved. The concept of dual production involves the simultaneous cultivation of crops and the rearing of livestock within the same agricultural system. This integrated approach has gained traction due to its potential for increased productivity and resource optimization. Historical perspectives reveal the evolution of dual production strategies, which include crop-livestock integration, silvopastoral systems, and diverse agroforestry approaches. While these strategies offer significant benefits, they also pose unique challenges that necessitate careful management and planning. Livestock grazing, as a major component of NRM, plays a crucial role in sustaining agricultural ecosystems. Different grazing systems, such as rotational grazing, continuous grazing, and adaptive grazing management, have varying implications for ecological balance and agricultural productivity. Despite its benefits, livestock grazing can have adverse environmental impacts, making it imperative to carefully consider the economics of these practices. The economic benefits of dual production are multifaceted, encompassing increased productivity and efficiency, diversified income streams, resource optimization, and reduced input costs. By leveraging market opportunities and emphasizing value addition, practitioners can enhance their economic returns and strengthen the resilience of their operations. Employing robust economic analysis methods, such as cost-benefit analysis, return on investment, and profitability metrics, can provide valuable insights into the long-term economic sustainability of dual production and livestock grazing. Addressing the policy and regulatory considerations associated with dual production and livestock grazing is essential for fostering a conducive environment for sustainable practices. Government incentives and support, coupled with environmental regulations and sustainability standards, can incentivize the adoption of environmentally friendly practices while ensuring compliance with conservation efforts. Furthermore, effective land use planning and zoning play a critical role in optimizing resource allocation and minimizing potential conflicts. Despite its potential, the implementation of dual production and livestock grazing faces many challenges that require careful consideration. Balancing the competing needs of crops and livestock, conserving the environment, preserving biodiversity, and navigating market and trade challenges pose significant hurdles. Building resilience to climate change is also paramount to ensuring the long-term viability of these practices. Looking ahead, embracing technology and innovation, leveraging data and precision agriculture, and catering to the global demand for sustainable agriculture can open up new avenues for growth and development. Investing in research and development to address the evolving needs of dual production and livestock grazing is crucial for ensuring continuous improvements and sustainability in the field of NRM.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4xkbs_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/4xkbs_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3202,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The causal role of synergy in collective problem-solving","authors":"Ketika Garg, Cody Moser, Hannah Dromiack, Zara Anwarzai, Gabriel Ramos-Fernandez","abstract":"The influence of network structure on a system's capacity to solve complex problems is a central focus in collective intelligence research.

Understanding how mis/disinformation is understood and framed in public discourse is essential to developing strategies for building societal resilience and promoting informed decision-making during crises. Objective: This study explores the use of the terms misinformation and disinformation across Swiss public discourse during the COVID-19 pandemic, examining its framing within newspaper articles and social media interactions. The findings aim to inform policymakers and journalists/communicators on mitigating the societal impact of mis/disinformation through the promotion of a common understanding of the terms misinformation and disinformation. Methods: We analyzed two datasets using an NLP pipeline, including lemmatization, co-occurrence analysis, and semantic network mapping: media articles retrieved via Factiva, and social media posts collected via CrowdTangle. Results: The framing of mis/disinformation varied significantly across the datasets. News media highlighted its role in shaping public sentiment, often discussing the tension between journalistic integrity and the amplification of falsehoods. Social media exhibited polarized narratives, with discussions centered on conspiracy theories, distrust in institutions, and grassroots mobilization. Conclusions: Diverging narratives on the very concepts of mis/disinformation across public discourse reflect broader societal tensions. Robust journalistic integrity in the media, and resilience strategies against mis/disinformation involving empowering publics through information literacy approaches are critical to bridging divides and reducing polarization.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dgvku_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/dgvku_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4822,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Debt maturity structure and stock price crash risk in African economies: the moderating role of accounting standards","authors":"Israfil","abstract":"This study examines the influence of debt maturity structure on stock price crash risk (SPCR) in African economies, focusing on the moderating role of accounting standards such as the IFRS and national GAAP.

Rather than representing a fundamental break, I argue that contemporary AI functions primarily as a powerful magnifier that accelerates existing colonial-modern epistemologies and extractivist knowledge patterns. By analyzing AI through the lens of extended cognition theory, I reposition these technologies within the historical continuum of human cognitive extensions, from early writing systems to computational tools, while acknowledging their distinctive emergent agential properties. This reconceptualization has profound implications for academic praxis, suggesting the need for a critical cognitive sovereignty—neither rejecting AI tools nor uncritically depending on them, but engaging them reflexively, holding the center of meaning-making within our subjective experience.

However, as Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into human cognition and life, particularly within complex socio-technical ecosystems shaped by powerful platforms [H], the limitations of this paradigm become apparent. Critiques grounded in the computational limits of AI [P] and the unique nature of human Existential Redundancy (ER) [F] suggest the traditional \"tool\" metaphor is insufficient. This paper argues for an extension from HCI to a more profound theoretical framework: HAC (Human-AI Co-becoming). Distinguishing itself clearly from \"Symbiotic Intelligence\" [M] (a speculative concept denoting potential emergent system-level intelligence), HAC serves as the design philosophy and interaction framework aimed at ethically guiding the dynamic, mutually shaping, and co-adaptive relationship between humans and AI, moving beyond the simplistic tool metaphor towards responsible co-evolution. This paper first critiques the inadequacies of traditional HCI goals in addressing deep human-AI integration within power-laden contexts [H]. Subsequently, it elaborates the theoretical foundations of HAC, integrating insights from critical AI studies, theories pertinent to symbiosis, ER theory [F], extended/enactive cognition, technophenomenology, and STS (acknowledging power structures [H]). Building upon this, it proposes a design philosophy for HAC, with core objectives of fostering Beneficial Co-adaptation (aligned with human values [N] and ER [F], actively resisting algorithmic domestication [P'] and platform-driven manipulation [H]), Existential Empowerment (safeguarding cognitive autonomy and ER [F, N]), and Relational Health (grounded in transparency about AI limits [P, F, O] and resisting inauthentic simulated relationships). It explores their normative sources, inherent ethical tensions, and the crucial influence of underlying power dynamics [H]. The paper further investigates potential interaction paradigms (e.g., deep coupling interfaces like BCI/XR, critically assessed) and mechanisms (e.g., embedded reflective mechanisms like 'Reflective Friction' as countermeasures to [P']), analyzing their profound ethical implications (including adaptive governance challenges) and cognitive impacts. Finally, it discusses the methodological challenges [C, O] and potential exploratory approaches for characterizing the dynamics and impacts of human-AI co-becoming relationships, emphasizing the limits of measurement and the need for qualitative, context-sensitive methods.

However, at the individual risk-factor level, notable differences emerge, emphasising the context-specific nature of certain predictors.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/euv7f_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/euv7f_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4335,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Do data management policies become more open over time?","authors":"Beth Montague-Hellen","abstract":"Research data management policies are ubiquitous in UK Higher Education Institutions, and are often written and managed by, or with, the library team.

This research looks at what shapes the investment behaviour of small-scale, residential landlords. It presents new evidence on rental investment behaviour and examines the potential impacts of policy changes on landlords’ costs of supplying rental housing, along with the effects on affordability for tenants. Why this research is important? Understanding what motivates landlords and their investment goals can help build a private rental sector that benefits more Australians. With the fast and ongoing growth of the private rental sector, this study makes a timely contribution to policy debates on the supply of rental housing by uncovering new evidence on patterns and drivers of rental property investment behaviour.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9fgr_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/u9fgr_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4536,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"[Q] Whose Echo? Authorship, Originality, and Responsibility Attribution in Deep Human-AI Co-Creation","authors":"Kwok, Yiu Hung","abstract":"The rise of Deep Human-AI Collaborative Creation (DHACC) blurs the lines between creator and tool, posing fundamental challenges to established theories of authorship, intellectual property (IP) regimes (especially copyright), and frameworks for legal and ethical responsibility. This paper delves into the interconnected core issues of authorship, originality, and responsibility attribution within the DHACC context. It first reviews the relevant theoretical and legal dilemmas. Second, it analyzes the difficulties in applying the \"human authorship\" principle and \"originality\" requirements of current copyright law, introducing a \"Human-AI Collaborative Authorship Spectrum\" as an analytical tool. Combining scenario examples and comparisons of key international legal stances (e.g., US Thaler case, China Li v. Liu case, EU position), it explores criteria for recognizing human contribution and rethinking the originality threshold, grounding the analysis firmly in the computational limits of AI [P] (incapable of independent conception) and the nature of human creativity rooted in Existential Redundancy (ER) [F]. Third, drawing explicitly on the ontological arguments from [P] and [F] (AI's lack of understanding, intentionality, and ER), it argues forcefully on philosophical and ethical grounds that current AI lacks the capacity for responsible agency, emphasizing the necessity of anchoring responsibility in humans via a multi-level accountability model that acknowledges power relations [H] and practical complexities (like the \"moral crumple zones\" identified by Elish, exacerbated by algorithmic opacity discussed in [O]). Finally, it examines future adaptation directions (advocating cautious assessment of IP reform, emphasizing the need for operationalized governance frameworks [I] and community norms), integrating a social equity perspective [N]. This paper contends that addressing the rights and responsibility challenges of DHACC requires an interdisciplinary, context-sensitive approach attentive to power and fairness, guided by a clear understanding of AI's computational nature [P] and human uniqueness [F] as elaborated within the Existential Symbiosis Theory [R].","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9awh_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/v9awh_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4257,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Keyword Newspeak: Trump’s Orwellian Censorship of DEI in Science","authors":"Natsumi Solange Shokida, Carolina Pradier, Étienne Marteau, Diego Kozlowski, Lucía Céspedes, Vincent Larivière","abstract":"Amid rising censorship of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) language in U.S. research policy, this paper examines the presence of flagged keywords in NSF-funded research from 1988 to 2024.

For example, computer systems have historically been deterministic and predictable, complicated but not complex, and the artefacts of human design. By contrast, biological systems have been stochastic and often unpredictable, both complicated and complex, and the product of path-dependent evolutionary selection. Nonetheless, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology now blurs these distinctions. For example, self-authoring AI exhibits characteristics, such as learning and surprise, previously associated exclusively with biological systems. Similarly, synthetic biology (SynBio) exhibits characteristics, such as engineered organisms, previously associated computer systems. The rapid convergence of AI and SynBio is accelerating the pace of innovation in both fields in ways that challenge existing governance systems. To date, spirited debates have failed to clarify guidance for policymakers with regard to regulatory standards. In this paper, we assert that conflicts in AI-SynBio convergence will continue to be unproductive until contrasting worldviews – what Costanza called the “pre-analytic vision” -- are explicitly acknowledged by a critical mass of stakeholders. Using the familiar shared experience of science fiction to stimulate the moral imagination, this paper describes oversimplified archetypes that caricature exaggerated views for the purpose of illustrating them. Then, it suggests an alternative approach to arguments that may resolve some controversies and orient technological development pathways towards outcomes that minimize regrets.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xutas_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/xutas_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3755,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"How Generative AI Fixes What Higher Education Broke","authors":"Theodore J Kalaitzidis","abstract":"Generative AI (GenAI) has not broken higher education. It has revealed that much of it was already broken. This paper argues that the dominant educational paradigm, rooted in formalist models of cognition, no longer serves the needs of a world filled with thinking machines. Learning, long reduced to internal recall and reproduction, must be recalibrated as the capacity to act meaningfully, critically, and creatively with tools in real-world contexts. This is not technological determinism. It’s an attempt to reconcile epistemic insolvency accruing compounding interest. Blending epistemological insight with systems-level critique and practical strategies, the paper exposes the reactive militarization between student evasion and faculty surveillance, and it challenges educators to transform traditional classroom activities with authentic, tool-mediated practice. Drawing from the fields of Learning Sciences and Instructional Design, it explores how GenAI can serve not as a threat to integrity, but as a compounding cognitive artifact: a “thought prosthesis,” a support system that amplifies creativity, an accessibility tool, and an enabler of personalized, real-time learning at scale. The paper proposes a Critical AI Literacy agenda grounded in epistemic awareness. This extends to include practical implementation of RAG tutors, Custom GPTs, interactive generators, student-led content production, and code-based learning; all deployed with an honest reckoning of GenAI’s deficits: semiotic fallacy, fabrication, bias, and ethical opacity. The result is a roadmap not only for responsible integration of GenAI in college classrooms, but for reimagining what education can become when human discernment, creativity, and tool fluency are placed at the center. The ideas within do not present GenAI as a savior or a scourge, but as a mirror allowing us to confront what education has become and inviting us to rebuild something better.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yh6rs_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/yh6rs_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.327,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"What Emotions Bring to Managing, Caring for, and Sharing Qualitative Data","authors":"Kathleen Gregory, Andrea Schikowitz, Elaine Goldberg, Sarah Davies","abstract":"This paper presents the findings of a collaborative autoethnography designed to deeply explore the question of how qualitative researchers relate to and care for their data.

Patel, Kim Hill, Chris von Rueden","abstract":"Current prominent music evolution theories suggest music evolved as a participatory group activity, whose adaptive functions were strengthening and/or signaling social cohesion. However, the prevalence of collective music-making varies substantially across societies, and in some cases is exceptionally rare. Here, we consider hypotheses for three factors which could attenuate collective music-making: diminished collective action more generally, an emphasis on musical expertise, and solo-oriented musical styles. We look at data related to these hypotheses in four societies in which collective music-making is rare: the Tsimane of lowland Bolivia, the Ache of eastern Paraguay, the Ayoreo of Bolivia and Paraguay, and the Tuvans of the Russian Republic of Tyva. Our results suggest that the scale and religiosity of collective action is the most important factor related to the overall degree of collective music-making in a culture. The effect of musical expertise was mostly limited to the dominance of shamans in religious contexts, while well-developed solo musical styles did not necessarily prevent group performance in other social settings. We also note the importance of cultural loss due to influence of invading colonial and imperial forces in diminishing indigenous forms of collective music-making. Notably, in all the cases we consider, episodes of some form of collective music-making do (or historically did) occur during important social events, a fact which supports the group-functionalist view. Our findings also point to the centrality and ubiquity of the religious function of music, and suggest this aspect of musical behavior needs to be better addressed by evolutionary theories of music.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zuhdy_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/zuhdy_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4264,"specialized":false,"preprint":true}]
