I propose the novel ethical concept of relational violence, which I suggest occurs when an external force damages an intimate bond by substantially disrupting an intimate relationship. Relational violence is generally wrong, and we have moral reasons to avoid it. But in the foster system, poverty, housing insecurity, and racial prejudice can lead to unnecessary relational violence through child removals. The foster system, then, emerges as an unjust institution that can compound the existing harms of racial and economic inequality with painful relational injustices.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.70003", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.70003", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008864353243841494}, {"title": "Why Inequalities Persist: Parties’ (Non)Responses to Economic Inequality, 1970–2020", "authors": "ALEXANDER HORN, MARTIN HASELMAYER, K.

Despite the relevance of inequality and its consequences, existing studies fail to capture parties’ emphasis on economic equality and redistribution or to differentiate between existing levels of inequality and increases in inequality. Based on 850,000 party statements from 12 (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries (1970–2020), we introduce a crowd-coded dataset that allows us to distinguish positive references to economic equality and redistribution from upward-trending equal-rights/anti-discrimination rhetoric. We show that responses found in previous studies do not capture economic equality and redistribution. In reassessing the impact of inequality, we argue that low visibility, status quo bias, and turnout effects discourage party responses to high inequality levels , while rising inequality poses a visible status quo change and a threat that left parties respond to. We find that left parties respond to inequality increases (except less tangible gains among the most affluent) but not to (high) inequality levels.

Implementing this simple but as yet undocumented insight to the debate over the effects of relative power, we show that “proximate power”—i.e., power adjusted for the loss-of-strength imposed by distance—reveals a close relationship between parity and conflict onset.

The study of how African agents have negotiated with or (re)defined institutions or entities in this relationship and how agents negotiate or utilize existing power structures to maintain or redefine existing settings has witnessed a surge in the past 20 years. The increase in literature on “African agency” offers not only a deeper understanding of the different ways that African actors use their various spaces of engagement to their advantage; it also has allowed researchers to more effectively locate, unpack, and outline such agency (Chipaike and Bischoff 2018; Chipaike and Bischoff 2019; Chipaike and Knowledge 2018; Chiyemura 2020; Corkin 2013; Cheru and Obi 2010; Gadzala 2015; Kragelund and Carmody 2016; Mohan and Lampert 2012; Mann 2023; Odoom 2019; Otele 2016). However, much of this literature categorizes African agency into general categories, such as state, nonstate, elite, and local agency. Although general categories prove useful for an initial understanding, they are limited in explaining the different ways that agency is carried out by different African actors within the state apparatus or among nonstate actors, their modalities, and their impact. Various actors within these large categories of state and nonstate actors exercise agency differently with different motivations, and they use different repertoires of action.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049096525000083", "doi": "10.1017/s1049096525000083", "journal_full": "PS: Political Science & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011598970825536403}, {"title": "Introduction: Rethinking China–Africa Engagements in the Age of Discontent", "authors": "Obert Hodzi", "abstract": "Over the past five years, China–Africa engagements have undergone significant changes, mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Using rational choice theory, we explain how this esoteric practice endured for so long. Monarchs engaged in the royal touch to secure political legitimacy and popular support by projecting divine favor and Christian benevolence, especially in times of instability or dynastic uncertainty. Meanwhile, patients willingly participated in the royal touch as it was a cheap and non-invasive procedure that was consistent with their belief in the efficacy of miracles. This belief was reinforced by scrofula’s self-limiting nature and by the monarchs’ strategic selection of likely-to-recover individuals. The practice ultimately faded with the spread of secularism, disillusionment in monarchy as a viable form of governance, and advancements in medical science. Our key finding is that mystical healing rituals persist when both patients and monarchs perceive them as net beneficial within their specific institutional and historical contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01314-0", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01314-0", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014980366457536975}, {"title": "When the party is over: Explaining the rise of the Spanish far-right SALF", "authors": "Javier Padilla Moreno-Torres, Álvaro Canalejo-Molero, Alberto López Ortega", "abstract": "Can a second far-right party succeed in a country where the radical right was, until recently, absent?

Through a comprehensive analysis of individual-level data from approximately 38,000 respondents across eleven surveys, we provide the first systematic assessment of SALF’s voters and compare them to other Spanish constituencies. First, our findings reveal an intriguing paradox: while SALF voters self-identify as more centrist than supporters of VOX (Spain’s main far-right party), their positions on substantive policies are similarly extreme. In contrast, SALF’s success stems from a distinctive combination of dissatisfaction with democracy and nontraditional media consumption patterns, especially among young male voters.

We first explore how model misspecification impacts learning. We provide some insight into classic results on misspecified learning in statistics. We then highlight the new long-run outcomes and technical challenges that arise when extending these results to common learning settings in economics, that is, active and social learning where information endogenously depends on action choices. Next, we provide an overview of Berk–Nash equilibrium, an equilibrium concept for strategic interaction with misspecified agents. We show how agents’ biases interact to influence equilibrium actions and beliefs.

A related idea from Lucas and Stokey is that inflation during wartime (or an analogous global emergency such as the COVID pandemic) can be an efficient form of state-contingent public finance. This study applies these ideas to the recent inflation in 37 OECD countries. The theory’s centerpiece is the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, which relates a country’s inflation rate in 2020-2023 to a composite government-spending variable. This variable equals the increases in ratios of government expenditure to GDP in 2020 and 2021, divided by the ratio of public debt to GDP in 2019 and the duration of the debt in 2019. The estimated coefficients of this variable are significantly positive, implying that about 80% of effective government financing came from the inverse effect of unexpected inflation on the real value of public debt, whereas only around 20% reflected conventional public finance (increases in current or future taxes or cuts in future spending). Within the Euro area, inflation reacts mostly to the area-wide composite government-spending variable, not to individual values.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf066", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueaf066", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008568695772928847}, {"title": "Designing social learning", "authors": "Aleksei Smirnov, Egor Starkov", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105113", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105113", "journal_full": "European Economic Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00906203942152528}, {"title": "Foreign exchange intervention: A comparative analysis of announcements versus trades", "authors": "Freddy Pinzon-Puerto, Mauricio Villamizar-Villegas", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105119", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105119", "journal_full": "European Economic Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06013382243908372}, {"title": "Towards a general model of creativity based on the theory of the adjacent possible", "authors": "Michael Araki", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105121", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroecorev.2025.105121", "journal_full": "European Economic Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014615547403871054}, {"title": "Predatory Private Governance", "authors": "Peter T.

I use these responses to estimate a dynamic model of labor supply with frictions that generate imperfect adjustment. My estimates imply that the labor supply responses to income-contingent repayment limit the optimal amount of insurance in government-provided student loans.

It focuses on how these women leverage various resources—human, psychological, social, and economic—to potentially contribute to Ukraine’s development during the ongoing conflict with Russia since February 2022 and in the eventual post-conflict period. This wave of Ukrainian war migration is notably rich in resources, particularly in terms of higher education, providing a basis for the formulation of this study. The research is framed within the concept of intangible remittances and incorporates the cumulative advantage effect , which suggests that individuals with more initial intangible resources are more likely to gain additional advantages, thereby enhancing their ability to generate intangible remittances. The study combines quantitative data from a novel survey with an anonymous feedback for participants measuring the level of their resources, conducted via the My Migration Dashboard ( https://mymigration.academy/ ) of 344 Ukrainian female war migrants, with qualitative follow-up insights from 20 in-depth interviews with female participants with higher education. Key quantitative findings reveal that although education and other intangible assets such as soft and cognitive skills, resilience and social networks contribute to cumulative advantage, two unique predictors stand out: civic engagement, which opens up further opportunities for education and training, and autonomous reflexivity which facilitates independent decisions.

By adopting a targeted reflexive lens, it adds a conceptual dimension to critical externalization research—a growing yet fragmented field of inquiry that foregrounds Afrocentric, historized, and grounded perspectives. The article examines the far-reaching implications of European externalization interventions in Africa through a review of recent literature and shows how European migration governance extends across new territories and policy domains, engaging stakeholders across scales and fields. These interventions generate effects that reach well beyond their immediate and intended policy outcomes, particularly as they intersect with African actors and realities that simultaneously shape and resist them.

In contrast, this study investigates the effects of the social dimension by incorporating two key domains: the housing and work domain (including housing affordability and commuting distance) and the social support and urban resource interaction domain (encompassing family and social network support, social belonging, urban identity, and urban resource assessment – such as public service accessibility). Using survey data from Shanghai, this study examines the determinants influencing new immigrants' settlement intentions in megacities. It reveals that housing and work conditions, such as affordable housing and shorter commuting distances, significantly enhance settlement intentions.

This relationship is particularly pronounced for unincorporated self‐employment compared to incorporated self‐employment. Our analysis contributes systematic evidence to the policy discourse surrounding the impact of immigration on economic opportunities for native‐born populations. We observe that immigrants are more inclined to become entrepreneurs and are associated with an overall increase in entrepreneurial activities, suggesting they may generate additional employment opportunities for native‐born individuals rather than displacing them. We also find that policies to incentivize and encourage relocating immigrants from high‐immigrant MSAs to low‐immigrant MSAs may benefit the country by increasing overall entrepreneurial activities.

Drawing from a diverse range of environmental landscapes in Colombia, we evaluate the effectiveness of satellite imagery‐derived settlement maps in conjunction with various modeling techniques.

Findings indicate that enforced confinement negatively impacts both measurements.

The objective is to replicate the approach of Plane and others using the life‐course perspective within the context of Russia. The analysis relies on long‐term internal migration statistics at the level of individual settlements (2011–2020 years). We identify 9 levels of the urban hierarchy–ranging from the largest cities to the smallest villages. Cities, together with their suburbs, are considered as units. Accordingly, if a city is attractive to migrants, its suburbs become attractive too. The results of our analysis show that upward vertical migration is predominant in Russia. The population continues to concentrate at the upper levels of the urban hierarchy, while the lower levels (rural settlements) are rapidly losing population. This observation is true for all age groups. We believe that such centripetal migration, observed across all age groups, is specifically a Russian phenomenon.

Many factors are linked to friendship, including physical proximity and interpersonal similarities. Recent work has leveraged neuroimaging to detect similarities among friends by capturing how people process the world around them. However, given the cross-sectional nature of past research, it is unknown if neural similarity precedes friendship or only emerges among friends following social connection. Here we show that similarities in neural responses to movie clips—acquired before participants met one another—predicted proximity in a friendship network eight months later (that is, participants with similar responses were more likely to be friends rather than several degrees of separation apart). We also examined changes in distances between participants in their shared social network, which resulted from the formation, persistence and dissolution of friendships, between two months and eight months after they met each other. Compared with people who drifted further apart, people who grew closer over this six-month period had been more neurally similar as strangers. In addition, analyses controlling for sociodemographic similarities showed that whereas these similarities appeared to drive the differences in pre-existing neural similarities between friends and dyads of a social distance of 3, they did not account for the more extensive links between pre-existing neural similarities and the tendency for people to grow closer together, rather than drift farther apart, over time. Thus, whereas some friendships may initially form due to circumstance and dissolve over time, later-emerging and longer-lasting friendships may be rooted in deeper interpersonal compatibilities that are indexed by pre-existing neural similarities. The localization of these results suggests that pre-existing similarities in how people interpret, attend to and emotionally respond to their surroundings are precursors of future friendship and increased social closeness.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-025-02266-7", "doi": "10.1038/s41562-025-02266-7", "journal_full": "Nature Human Behaviour", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013887772851836622}, {"title": "Quantifying large language model usage in scientific papers", "authors": "Weixin Liang, Yaohui Zhang, Zhengxuan Wu, Haley Lepp, Wenlong Ji, Xuandong Zhao, Hancheng Cao, Sheng Liu, Siyu He, Zhi Huang, Diyi Yang, Christopher Potts, Christopher D.

We model dyadic interactions in a heterogeneous population where individuals biased toward a zero-sum worldview are more likely to invest in competition, while those biased toward a positive-sum worldview are more likely to invest in cooperation. The environment alternates stochastically between cooperative and competitive states. Without social influence, the more accurate worldview yields higher utilities and spreads throughout the population. However, assortative matching by bias can favor the positive-sum worldview even if a positive-sum environment is somewhat less likely. With peer conformity, inaccurate worldviews can persist after a structural change in the environment, leading to cultural evolutionary mismatch. In the presence of cultural authorities who can alter beliefs, either both worldviews can coexist or one excludes the other. Moreover, when assortative matching and conformity interact, authorities may profit by amplifying individuals’ biases, creating enclaves of similarly biased people who can pay the authorities enough to make investment in persuasive technology economically viable. Cultural evolutionary mismatch is more likely in cultures marked by strong peer conformity and high responsiveness to authority when the authority promotes a suboptimal worldview.

For the past two decades, climate activism and mitigation efforts have largely focused on energy, industry, and transportation as the main contributors to anthropogenic warming. Although there is a long way to go to eliminate emissions from these sources, increasing international ambition means that attention is now turning to other hard-to-decarbonize sectors. Net zero food systems in particular pose unique challenges for humanity, given the moral dimensions of food security and the strong potential for vicious cycles: Globally hunger is back on the rise, the changing climate is already making food production for a growing population more difficult, and food shocks could lead to more land use change emissions that accelerate warming and feed back to negatively impact agricultural productivity and hunger. The dynamics of food production and consumption differ from other sectors and reveal several dimensions in which it will be critical to get policy right. Recent science suggests that two coordinated efforts will be needed to meet this challenge—a revamped focus on smallholder adaptation and productivity, and new “safety valve” institutions that sit at the intersection of food production and climate mitigation efforts and can operate at the relevant spatial and temporal scales to avoid negative tradeoffs in the quest to eliminate hunger and stabilize earth’s climate.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2410202122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2410202122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014908251165057007}, {"title": "How publics in small-island states view climate change and international responses to it", "authors": "Matto Mildenberger, Sara M.

These places bear virtually no responsibility for climate change but will face sea-level rise, fresh water resource degradation, and intensified storms that will kill or dislocate exposed publics, and damage local economies. To alleviate this crisis, the global community has begun discussing who is responsible for climate mitigation and adaptation costs for those affected by climate change, in addition to continued debates around the distribution of responsibility for climate change. Missing from this analysis, however, are systematic efforts to elicit the preferences and perceptions of publics in these threatened small-island states and territories. Here, we report results from a large-sample (n = 14,710) cross-national survey of publics living in climate-vulnerable states and territories, conducted in June–July 2022. By quota sampling through Facebook’s ad platform, we generate survey samples at the national or territorial level for publics in 55 small-island states, territories, and subnational regions in the South Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Caribbean. We find widespread awareness and concern about the threat posed by climate change and sea-level rise, in contrast to what existing research finds in the Global North. We also find that climate-vulnerable publics believe their home governments, large polluters, and former colonial powers are all responsible for helping to manage the climate crisis, irrespective of these actors’ relative carbon emissions. These findings fill an important gap by depicting climate beliefs among the communities at the frontlines of climate change.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2415324122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2415324122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014979249763310776}, {"title": "Tree rings reveal persistent Western Apache (Ndee) fire stewardship and niche construction in the American Southwest", "authors": "Christopher I.

In the Southwest United States, well-replicated fire histories suggest that abundant lightning and suitable climate conditions drove frequent low-severity wildfires in dry pine forests independent of human activities even as ethnography provided hints that highly mobile indigenous populations used fire in myriad land use contexts. Here, we leverage published and unpublished tree-ring fire history records from pine forests in Western Apache (Ndee) traditional territory in central and eastern Arizona (N = 34 sites, N = 649 trees) to demonstrate that historical fire regimes were overwhelmingly influenced by Ndee cultural burning. Our tree-ring synthesis shows significantly more frequent fires in Ndee territory than elsewhere in the region for centuries before the establishment of reservations (1600–1870 CE). Despite the heightened fire activity, fires were largely small and asynchronous, occurred disproportionately in late April and May, when Ndee invested significant subsistence activities in these pine forests, and occurred independent of climate drivers. This suggests that Ndee fire stewardship created a patchwork of nearly annual small, spring fires that inhibited natural fire spread and limited the influence of drought on fire activity. Our work shows that even relatively small, highly mobile populations of forager-gardeners had significant influence on some pre-Euroamerican fire regimes despite abundant natural ignitions. Our study shows clearly that Indigenous fire management impacted fire-size distributions, fire frequencies, and fire seasonality in ways that cannot be explained by seasonal and annual lightning densities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2509169122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2509169122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019120156590884285}, {"title": "Census in crisis—further erasure of Indigenous Peoples?", "authors": "Tahu Kukutai", "abstract": "In 2013, demographer David Coleman wrote that the population census in its traditional form was heading toward its twiligh t.

In this article, we apply these insights but offer a modified theoretical model that acknowledges the interrelationship of these mechanisms and examines their interaction over time. We draw on the case of early childhood education and care (ECEC) policy in three federal systems—Australia, Canada, and Germany. We develop an original index that maps policy making across the three sub‐national contexts across time to examine the impact of institutionalized private actors of varying status (for‐profit, not‐for‐profit) and power. We argue that regulatory frameworks introduced at the original delegation stage at t1 affect the likelihood of accretion and demonstrate the inter‐relationship between institutional business power and regulatory and governance factors which shape the early years market. Importantly, these accretion dynamics, characterized by increasing market share of for‐profit providers, has the capacity to significantly undermine the social investment logics underpinning government action by constraining access to ECEC services (through high costs), reducing regulations, and thus undermining the quality of ECEC services for parents and children.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.70044", "doi": "10.1111/gove.70044", "journal_full": "Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006246370003377577}, {"title": "State‐Centric Persistence: Pursuing Social Welfare Benefits in Brazil", "authors": "Rebecca Weitz‐Shapiro, Matthew S.

I test this argument in Vietnam, a single‐party regime with weak accountability mechanisms. Using data from 2011 to 2016 on citizen‐reported bribery across districts, I show that when province‐level transparency reports signal higher levels of corruption than local officials may have previously perceived, wrongdoing increases in the following year. The findings are consistent with a mechanism in which new information lowers the perceived risks associated with corrupt behavior. I rule out alternative explanations, including statistical reversion and citizen‐driven reporting effects, and show that the effects are strongest in areas where bureaucrats are more likely to be exposed to the information.

Yet occupations are not easily translated into a linear hierarchical measure. Influential scales combine multiple indicators and lack intuitive interpretation. We therefore present a new scale based on occupations’ earnings potential (OEP). OEP measures the median earnings of occupations and expresses them as percentiles of the overall earnings structure: if mechanics earn the national median wage, their OEP is 50. We construct national OEP scales using annual microdata pooled over several decades for Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US. Consistent with the Treiman constant, these national scales are highly correlated over time and across countries, justifying the use of one common OEP scale.

Ah-Qism is the transformation of merely zoological life (zoe) into historical or political life (bios). I will argue that subjectivity and the political momentarily emerge through this transformation, which Lu Xun’s text represents through Ah Q’s repeated encounter with stronger persons and his ability to ‘transform defeat into spiritual victory.’ An important implication of this argument is that conventional concerns of ‘politics’ such as force, domination, and hierarchy are not primarily within the purview of the study of politics but of the study of animal behavior. While force is the basis of all individuation, it is necessary but insufficient for individuation qua subjectivity. Power difference and subjection is the norm of all ethological experience, but a unique mode of experience is available to subjected persons like Ah Q: political experience. Political experience occurs when past subjection is transformed into subjectivity. However, political experience is relatively infrequent and ephemeral. Furthermore, the political cannot be celebrated nor condemned a priori since its effects can be, from a given perspective, affirming or nihilistic. A second implication is that empire and revolution are also not political but rather limits to the political.

Disinformation (the intentional spread of false or misleading information in furtherance of a goal) has come to affect nearly every aspect of public life, from forcing authority figures into time consuming debunking efforts to fully controlling conversations on foundational issues. Although amorphous, disinformation exhibits many shared characteristics and markers that allow it to be effectively tracked and outed publicly as the malign influence it represents. However, for something so prevalent, there is often confusion over what disinformation actually is. This is compounded into an alarming issue when people acting in the political discourse are unable, or even unwilling, to identify pieces of disinformation. But why is this? Why is something so divisive and toxic so omnipresent, effective, and difficult to prove to the very people affected by it? This article seeks to examine the structure and characteristics of disinformation, analyzing the components which make up a disinformation campaign, the psychology that allows it to flourish, and the lifecycle that disinformation often follows. In the latter half of the article we walk through a proven Russian disinformation campaign from the perspective of the disinformation actor, using real world examples to illustrate the concepts discussed and emphasize the potential impact of such malign influence efforts.

Its crisis governance has been particularly discussed, with a renewed debate centring around the accountability of executive institutions during times of crisis. Due to the urgency of the circumstances, and to ensure efficient and effective policy outputs, crisis decision-making is often led by executive institutions, and the scrutiny mechanisms normally enacted by the legislators are often sidelined. Against this background, this paper discusses the Commission’s accountability in its exercise of delegated powers pursuant to Arts. 290 and 291 TFEU in the context of crises. Arts. 290 and 291 TFEU regulate the use of delegated and implementing acts, respectively. Delegated acts are non-legislative acts of general application aimed at amending or supplementing an existing legislative act. Implementing acts, on the other hand, establish detailed rules for the uniform implementation of legally binding acts within the EU. The Commission is empowered to adopt both kinds of acts and is subject to two different scrutiny mechanisms in doing so. In the case of delegated acts, it is the European Parliament (EP) and Council that may object to their adoption. Meanwhile, implementing acts are instead scrutinised by committees made of representatives of the member states, known as comitology committees. Even during normal times, the Commission appears to be able to adopt delegated and implementing acts relatively quickly and smoothly, without opposition from the relevant bodies entrusted with their scrutiny. As such, the accountability of such exercise of powers is often questioned and debated in the academic literature. Considerations become more complex when an emergency situation is factored into the equation. On the one hand, the already disputed accountability of the Commission vis-à-vis the legislators and the comitology committee does not positively contribute to the overarching executive accountability in crisis management – nor, one could argue, does it worsen it. On the other hand, the short procedural times and smoothness of the process enable the efficient adoption of measures, which is imperative in times of crisis. To address the accountability gaps identified in the exercise of delegated and implementing powers during the Covid-19 pandemic, this paper proposes three policy recommendations: strengthening the scrutiny mechanisms for delegated acts by enhancing the capacity of the European Parliament and the Council; increasing the transparency of comitology committee meetings and procedures, including through a revision of the Comitology Regulation and improvements to the related registers; and introducing a clear legal framework for emergency powers to ensure that crisis-driven decision-making remains legitimate. These measures aim to reinforce executive accountability while preserving the EU’s ability to act swiftly in times of crisis.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/en6d9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/en6d9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.006381245912415401}, {"title": "The Digital Expansion of Transnational Repression", "authors": "Martina Lucaccini", "abstract": "Early cyber-optimist views framed Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as tools of political empowerment and democratic mobilization. However, the global spread of digital authoritarianism has revealed how digital media can also serve as instruments of repression. These repressive practices extend beyond national borders, targeting diaspora and exile communities through what is now termed Transnational Repression (TR). While most existing research has concentrated on domestic contexts or focused narrowly on physical (analog) forms of repression, little systematic work has explored the digital dimensions of this phenomenon. This paper investigates how digital technologies reshape states' strategies of TR across regime types, with particular attention to the rise of Digital Transnational Repression (DTR). DTR includes tactics such as online threats to dissidents and their families, digital surveillance, hacking, censorship of dissident content, and manipulation of the information environment. Drawing on rationalist models from the dissent–repression literature, I argue that states confronted with digitally mobilized transnational publics face a strategic trade-off: they may adopt either traditional physical repression or lower-cost digital alternatives. To investigate this phenomenon, I introduce a novel dataset that systematically captures both analog and digital forms of transnational repression across all regime types.

This framework explicitly accounts for history-dependent processes, offering a novel perspective on the physics of learning and the emergence of cognitive biases. A key implication explored is the concept of “Learning as a Solitaire Self-Game,” where individual cog- nition is viewed as a strategic optimization process against internal uncertainties, governed by substrate-dependent physical constants.

It posits that the international system's primordial state is not a passive anarchy but a latent and perpetual chaos—a roiling potential for disorder stemming from incompatible drives for security, resources, and meaning. International order is therefore a temporary and artificial construct, achieved through the Hegemonic Suppression of this chaos by a dominant power. This period of stability, the Dormant Order, is maintained via a tripartite strategy of coercive force, narrative dominance, and systemic institutionalization. Power is thus reconceptualized as the capacity for Coercive Containment. The theory's central dynamic is a tragic paradox: the very mechanisms of suppression contain the seeds of their own destruction. To maintain its material dominance, the hegemon is compelled to undertake actions that systematically betray the universalist narrative legitimizing its rule. This fundamental contradiction precipitates Moral Fatigue—a progressive decay of will and self-belief within the hegemonic core—which in turn catalyzes a system-wide Epistemic Crisis, shattering the shared consensus on which the order depends. As the hegemon's capacity for Coercive Containment wanes, Revisionist Vanguards emerge, who instrumentalize the hegemon's normative contradictions to orchestrate the order's collapse. The resultant transitional phase of acute, multipolar conflict and institutional breakdown is the Interregnum of Chaos. This volatile period concludes only when a new hegemon emerges to re-impose order, resetting the cycle under the influence of what we term Cyclical Gravity: the system's inherent structural tendency to revert to chaos in the absence of overwhelming suppressive power. History, therefore, does not progress linearly towards perpetual peace but moves in a relentless cycle of suppressed chaos, normative decay, and violent reorganization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k5z7p_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/k5z7p_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011580971663377904}, {"title": "The (Non)Academic Community Forming around Replications: Mapping the International Open Science space via its Replication Initiatives", "authors": "Sheena F.

Employing a hermeneutic approach and a socio-linguistic perspective, combined with the institutional context of the Warring States period and contemporary sociological theories, this paper proposes that “Qiu Yi” denotes a survival-driven response manifested as displaced, non-institutional labor emerging from systemic disorder and institutional collapse following military defeat. This phrase, rather than illustrating centralized governance, unveils the disintegration of national mobilization capacity, the breakdown of social order, and the fragmentation of the populace. At the semantic level, “Qiu” (丘) transcends its literal meaning as a mound or battlefield, symbolizing a disordered social domain characterized by involuntary gathering and dispersal; “Yi” (役) refers to marginalized, non-voluntary labor detached from institutional protections. This reinterpretation resonates with contemporary phenomena such as the rise of the gig economy, failures in strategic governance, and early indicators of systemic collapse, revealing an embedded early-warning logic within Sun Tzu’s military treatise. The phrase “Ji Yu Qiu Yi” is thus reframed as a linguistic signal of strategic imbalance, offering a novel perspective on dynamic governance, social resilience, and national security risks in the modern era. The contributions of this research are threefold: (1) rectifying long-standing semantic misinterpretations and Western interpretive biases in classical texts; (2) developing an interpretive framework that integrates semantic reconstruction with historical context and sociological insights; and (3) underscoring the pivotal role of popular agency in the collapse of strategic systems and governance structures, providing profound implications for understanding contemporary gig economies, policy failures, and public sentiment fragmentation.

This paper proposes a simplified formulation of the trichotomy: power at its most fundamental is the capacity to act and achieve outcomes and is labelled power-to. Power-over and power-with become two opposing exercises of this capacity. Power-over retains its emphasis on the hoarding of value by the dominant (normatively negative). Power-with is redefined to refer to an exercise of power in which value is equitably shared (normatively positive). These new definitions require that we abandon some of the distinguishing features that have been attached to these terms, but doing so resolves some outstanding disputes and provides new opportunities.

Drawing from fiduciary law, corporate governance design, valuation modeling, and public policy, the paper argues that non-ERISA equity vehicles fail to scale because they rely on discretionary corporate behavior, lack regulatory oversight, and expose workers to unmanaged concentration risk. In contrast, the paper proposes that fiduciary-aligned, ERISA-governed structures—particularly S Corporation ESOPs—offer a more viable, institutional pathway to inclusive employee ownership. It presents a second-best equilibrium framework, acknowledging the imperfections of ESOPs while demonstrating their superior governance, statutory protections, and retirement wealth-building potential when compared to unregulated stock grants.

The paper concludes with five policy design recommendations to expand inclusive ownership, including reforms to ESOP liquidity structures, diversification constraints, and legal safe harbors for fiduciaries.

It proposes \"dynamic equilibrium,\" where stability arises from interactions between agents' internal characteristics and external factors. A key equation derived from the paper is \"R_t-ρ=n+D_a-(U_(θa)θ)/U_c\". Its left-hand side, the discrepancy between asset return (R_t) and time preference rate (ρ), is balanced by two forces on the right-hand side: retaining capital within the economy (the marginal utility of assets compared to consumption) and promoting its diffusion and dilution (capital outflow (D_a) and population growth (n)). That suggests that if time preference is an inherent trait, economies with a lower time preference will have a funds surplus, but this will be partially offset by capital outflow or a weak asset preference, so the decline in the real interest rate will be limited, and vice varsa. The paper argues that while conventional economics has focused on the left-hand side of this equation, understanding the right-hand side is crucial. This mechanism will be able to pragmatically explain various modern economic phenomena through the immobilization of the relations between debtor and creditor even when agents are rational and markets are efficient : for example, long-term global imbalances, deflationary equilibrium in developed economies, and inequalities of income and assets and so on.

This study investigates the association between maternal experience of child marriage and children’s exposure to child labour across 11 countries in West and Central Africa. Using nationally representative data from the sixth round of the Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), we examine associations between maternal child marriage (before age 18) and children’s exposure to categories of child labour: economic activity above age-defined thresholds, hazardous household chores, and employment in hazardous industries or occupations. We also explore the relationship between the timing of marriage and children’s work intensity, measured as total hours worked per week. Generalised linear models and double robust estimators were employed, with analyses stratified by gender and country. We find that maternal child marriage is consistently associated with increased odds of child labour, particularly in hazardous industries or occupations. These effects are strongest for girls and persist even after adjusting for maternal education and household wealth. Country-specific regressions reveal heterogeneity in our findings, with the strongest associations between maternal child marriage and child labour observed in Nigeria. Our findings suggest that maternal child marriage is likely associated with a higher risk of next-generation exposure to child labour, especially for daughters and in hazardous occupations and industries. While preventive efforts to end child marriage remain vital, supporting early married mothers in high burden settings can help mitigate the transmission of intergenerational consequences.

Psychological research has largely overlooked these institutional contexts, focusing instead on individual dispositions or decontextualized mechanisms. We address this blind spot by investigating how institutions shape perpetrators’ self-concepts — and how this transformation enables lethal violence. Drawing on in-depth interviews with U.S. and Ukrainian soldiers, we develop a phenomenologically grounded account of mechanistic self-dehumanization: a psychological state in which individuals experience themselves as instruments lacking emotional responsiveness and reflective self-awareness. We show how this state is cultivated by institutionalized practices that suppress individuality, restrict autonomy, and automate lethal action. We find that mechanistic self-dehumanization facilitates violence by dulling moral reflexivity while preserving behavioral control. Strikingly, it can also render violence affirming — allowing perpetrators to experience killing not only as tolerable, but as a source of professional pride. In doing so, mechanistic self-dehumanization bridges two dominant psychological perspectives: one that sees violence as a burdensome act requiring moral disengagement, and one that sees it as subjectively rewarding. These findings refine the construct of self-dehumanization, illuminate its institutional origins, and deepen our understanding of how lethal violence becomes not only tolerable but, at times, gratifying.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6hn8_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/f6hn8_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.01380923501320308}, {"title": "Schooled into Silence: The Death of Thinking in Indian Education", "authors": "Akanksha Singh, Harshvardhan Rai", "abstract": "This paper grapples with a quietly persistent problem in the Indian education system: a deep-rooted crisis of thinking. It traces how historical legacies, conventional institutional structures, and dominant ideological frameworks have together fostered a pedagogy that values silence over introspection. Even as policy documents like the National Education Policy 2020 speak the language of reform and progressive learning, the reality in many Indian classrooms remains largely unchanged. Memorisation continues to overshadow reflection; conformity is rewarded more than curiosity, and debate is often equated with being disrespectful. The core argument here is that the crisis is not just curricular. It stems from deeper epistemological assumptions—the ways in which learning itself is conceived, structured, and then analysed. Drawing on thinkers such as Matthew Lipman, Paulo Freire, and Gert Biesta, the paper approaches critical thinking as more than a cognitive skill. It is understood as a reflective, dialogic, and ethically grounded mode of engagement—qualities that are often sidelined in a system driven by outcomes, metrics, and examination success. There is also a concern about how terms like “critical thinking” have been superficially adopted in national frameworks, such as the NCERT Learning Outcomes, without a genuine shift in pedagogic intent. This tokenism, coupled with the systematic marginalisation of the humanities and philosophical inquiry, has gradually eroded students’ capacity for ethical reflection and civic engagement. What the current moment demands, the paper suggests, is not another layer of reform, but a more foundational rethinking of education itself. This means moving away from a delivery-oriented, standardised model toward one that places inquiry, dialogue, and philosophical contemplation at its core. In a society as plural and contested as India, the cultivation of the capacity to question, to imagine otherwise, and to hold space for dissent is not optional.

Despite the growing empirical interest, there is a lack of agreement regarding the definition and measurement of gentrification, which has led to a variety of findings and has complicated the scholarly and policy discourse. Objectives This study critically evaluates the quantitative methodologies applied to describe and measure gentrification in peer-reviewed literature. The objective is to identify methodological shortcomings, demonstrate current practices, and provide recommendations for future research. Methods Empirical data was used to operationalize gentrification in a systematic review of 179 quantitative studies published between 1973 and 2020. The theoretical framework, variable selection, spatial and temporal dimensions, data sources, and analytic approaches of each study were examined. Results The findings show significant variability in the operationalization of gentrification, including a dependence on decade-long intervals, census tract-level studies, and simple criteria. Few studies integrate supply and demand factors or use race as a key analytic component. Methodological complexity has increased in recent years, with more research using blended indicators and multivariate approaches, although inconsistencies and ambiguities remain. Mixed methods approaches and the incorporation of local context are underutilized. Conclusion To improve the rigor and comparability of gentrification research, future studies should use deeper and theoretically grounded measurement methodologies, describe methodological decisions transparently, and address spatial, temporal, and social issues more completely.

A survey conducted by The Associated Press in December 2023 revealed that nearly 70% of newsroom staffers reported using generative AI for tasks such as crafting social media posts, newsletters, headlines, and even drafting articles (Mahadevan, 2024). This paper reveals that the probabilistic modeling used by text-drafting algorithms in newsrooms is not only in direct contrast to how human journalists write articles, but is subject to opaque decisions made by technology corporations with different practices and values than news media organizations. This study assesses the experiences of journalistic practitioners through semi-structured interviews with news workers and experts, working in both technical and non-technical roles, in the United States and the United Kingdom. The results highlight how generative AI is reshaping journalism by impacting three main groups: individual journalists, news organizations, and audiences. Generative AI is transforming how individual journalists do their work and how news organizations operate–from gathering and verifying information to producing and distributing content to their audiences. First, respondents agreed that LLMs are mediocre at writing full articles on their own, but are proving useful for tasks like brainstorming, summarization, and translation. Second, at the organizational level, generative AI is pushing newsrooms and tech companies to rethink how the incentives of journalism and tech companies align. Finally, when it comes to audiences, there was less agreement from respondents on exactly how the relationship is changing, but a clear consensus that audiences are attending to the possibility of AI authorship–and its potential mistakes–in news and the fact that this could undercut trust in the accuracy of journalists. These findings underscore the importance of awareness among journalists, organizations, and the public of newsroom dependency on the technology sector given the difference between how humans and journalists create news.

We investigate the effects of providing personalized feedback on participation behavior in an app-based household budget diary study in the general population of the Netherlands. The timing of providing personalized feedback was varied through a random assignment to two experimental conditions: half of the participants received their personalized feedback instantly, and half of the participants received their personalized feedback after 14 days, at the end of the study. We used mobile app paradata to study how participants interact with their personalized feedback and whether providing personalized feedback leads to higher data quality and/or unwanted behavioral change. We find that most participants view their personalized feedback and that visits to the screen presenting feedback are more likely to be longer when the feedback contains more new information for participants. We find no relationship between personalized feedback and data quality or unwanted behavioral change, but we do find a positive relation between data quality and the duration of viewing the feedback by participants. This finding suggests that the collection of in-app paradata can inform researchers about the whether the efforts of implementing personalized feedback which is costly, are worth undertaking.

Understanding how people perceive AI-generated misinformation is therefore crucial for designing effective interventions and safeguarding information integrity. To address this, we embedded a pre-registered experiment in a large-scale web survey conducted across 27 European countries. Participants were presented with eight short news headlines related to the Russo-Ukrainian war: four AI-generated and four human-generated, evenly split between real and fake news. For each headline, respondents assessed its perceived veracity and their willingness to share it. Our findings show that, regardless of authorship, fake news is less likely to be perceived as accurate and less likely to be shared, although differences between human- and AI-generated content were minimal. This pattern was remarkably consistent across the 27 countries, with some variation by individual characteristics.

To understand how academics think about and justify misconduct, we develop a novel set of neutralization techniques tailored to the field of scientific misconduct. We draw on a large body of research in criminology on other areas where neutralizations have been investigated. This study is the first to apply them in the context of violations against the scientific code and investigate whether those who neutralize are more likely to commit scientific misconduct. We draw upon a newly collected data set based on a large-scale survey of scientists in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland (Zurich Survey of Aca- demics, ZSoA) that was explicitly designed to capture forms of scientific misconduct. Consistent with our hypotheses, our results reveal a positive correlation between agreeing with neutralization techniques and engaging in scientific misconduct, with denial of responsibility, denial of victims, condemnation of condemners, and appeal to higher loyalties showing significant associations. Ad- ditionally, demographic and work condition influences indicate that male and non-tenured scientists tend to agree more with neutralization statements, compared to female and more senior researchers. We examine in detail the rationalization techniques employed by scientists to justify instances of misconduct, offering insights into the psychological and situational factors that contribute to such behavior. Furthermore, proactive intervention strategies are proposed to disrupt the learning process of these rationalizations, emphasizing the importance of promoting ethical decision-making and ac- countability within scientific institutions.

Here we employed an agent-based-model to examine how they both influence cassava (Manihot esculenta) diversity in traditional socioecological systems. We simulated the vertical diffusion of cassava varieties in three kinship systems (Endogamy, Dual Organization and Generalized Exchange), characterized here by unilineal and patrilineal descent, and implemented a null model in which inheritance occurred at random. Only asexual reproduction was implemented. Given the model’s constraints, it successfully captured the expected loss of diversity over time while also demonstrating that social norms slow down this process. Furthermore, we identified the distribution of varieties among households — particularly the number of varieties each household maintains — as a key determinant of diversity persistence at the community level. Our study highlights the importance of exploring—both ethnographically and theoretically—the complementarities between horizontal and vertical transmission, as well as their interactions with biological factors.

Through theoretical modeling and comparative analysis, I demonstrate how DTUF addresses key limitations of existing UBI proposals while mitigating the innovation access gaps that perpetuate wealth concentration in knowledge economies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jdwqn_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/jdwqn_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.016821698741317004}, {"title": "Rural Drinking Water in India: Policy, Programs and Achievements", "authors": "Ramesha Naika, Shivanand Pawar, Veena B", "abstract": "Since India gained independence, various policies and programs have been implemented to provide access to clean rural drinking water and ensure good health for all citizens. However, in rural areas, the provision of safe and adequate drinking water remains a significant challenge. Many rural communities still do not have access to water of suitable quality, leading to a multitude of health issues during different seasons. This article seeks to examine the performance of programmes and the evolution of policies in this context using the available literature that was implemented after independence. It also looks at whether the policymakers considered the lessons learned from the past while designing the program or policy. According to the analysis, policies and programmes have gradually moved towards the goals of sustainable drinking water management in rural areas. The primary issue is the main problems of implementing the program, but in recent years, the government of India introduced the Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) in 2019, with the goal of providing every family with \"Har Ghar Jal,\" or access to safe drinking water from tap connections. The Indian government has focused more on this program; despite the significant efforts of the JJM, over 14.79 crore (76.61%) of rural households presently have access to a potable water supply. The study suggests that by 2030, all Indian states and the federal government should make a collective effort to ensure that every Indian family has access to 100% safe and affordable drinking water in their homes.

This study theorizes about how human–AI communication shapes attitudes toward AI and influences the formation of public opinion, sparking solutionist imaginaries. We empirically examine the attitude formation resulting from the non-simulated use of an unmanipulated con-versational model in a controlled laboratory experiment (N = 164). Using a be-tween-subjects design, participants engaged in three semi-structured 20-minute sessions with ChatGPT, providing a novel perspective on the effects of its use. The findings reveal that mere use of ChatGPT causally increases AI acceptance; howev-er, its impact significantly depends on how the system is used. Especially non-instrumental, guided exploratory usage activates the solutionist imagination and leads to greater AI acceptance.

Yet, despite their promise of co-production and inclusion, ULLs often reproduce existing hierarchies of authority and dominant epistemic regimes, leaving marginalized residents consulted but rarely heard. Drawing on ethnographic work combined with volunteering in the stigmatized territory of Rotterdam South, this paper interrogates the politics of participation in a ULL-situation. I show how epistemic and social injustices persist within participatory processes, shaped by the devices of policy, planning and knowledge production. Building on recent Science and Technology Studies (STS) and Isabelle Stengers’s speculative realist philosophy, I propose to reimagine ULLs as potential transformational devices for epistemic and social justice – sites where the conditions for recognizing and articulating stigmatized knowledges can be experimentally and experientially reconfigured from a liminal place. Rather than seeking closure or consensus, a speculative realist ethos values rare, trans-situational events that slow down and unsettle established epistemic regimes and open new possibilities for public action.

Adopting a helicopter view, the paper seeks to stimulate research on badges by demonstrating that they are not simple gamified features, as generally understood, but critical infrastructures for the algorithmic governance of social interaction. Drawing from social theory, the paper reconceptualizes badges as automatable identification and verification credentials, making users predictable and governable, thus mediating identity and access to resources on a particular platform. This reconceptualization positions platforms’ badging as a crucial phase in the history of credentialing, shaping verification practices in digitized and datafied societies. The analysis of badging systems collected from secondary literature and industry sources shows how algorithmic logic has transformed badges into data-driven communicative devices. The paper concludes by discussing how platform badging practices increase the quantity, granularity, and rigidity of the individual identity attributes being certified and verified.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uvdy9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uvdy9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00787736330888189}, {"title": "Operational Equity and Data Quality in India's Aadhaar System", "authors": "Akshar Mishra", "abstract": "India’s Aadhaar program, the largest biometric identity system globally, reports saturation levels exceeding 100% in several states. While near-universal coverage is often celebrated, less is known about operational equity and data-quality challenges in ongoing maintenance- biometric updates, demographic corrections, and benefit scheme enrolment. This study analyzes March 2025 records of Aadhaar biometric updates, demographic updates, and new enrolments, normalized by state-level saturation data from UIDAI. In the absence of state-level biometric authentication logs, we use adult biometric update rates as a proxy for verification activity. Both raw and sensitivity-capped measures are applied to account for oversaturation. Correlation and regression models, alongside uncertainty quantification, reveal that high Aadhaar coverage does not guarantee scheme uptake or robust data integrity. Oversaturation emerges as a key stress signal, and persistent last-mile gaps remain for vulnerable, less urbanized regions.
