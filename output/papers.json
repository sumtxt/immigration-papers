[{"title": "Storm from the Steppes: Warfare and Succession Institutions in Pre-Modern Eurasia, 1000–1799 CE", "authors": "DANIEL STEVEN SMITH", "abstract": "A prominent literature on pre-modern warfare and institution-building holds that intense military competition in pre-modern Europe encouraged institutional innovations—for example, centralized bureaucracies and monopolies on coercion—that empowered rulers and enhanced state capacity, with salutary effects on long-run political development. States that adopted these innovations were more likely to survive, whereas those that did not succumbed to invading armies. Yet links between geopolitical competitiveness and capacity building are largely theorized and tested based on the European historical experience. A broader view of that period reveals a more complicated picture. The dominant mode of warfare throughout much of medieval and early modern Eurasia, Inner Asian cavalry warfare (IACW), favored succession institutions that selected for competent military leaders at the expense of long, secure reigns and cumulative capacity-building potential. I explore these links between IACW, succession practices, and rule duration with a novel dataset of over 300 Eurasian dynasties.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s000305542510097x", "doi": "10.1017/s000305542510097x", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.019502952208497515}, {"title": "The Legacy of Multi-Dimensional Conflict", "authors": "Joan Barceló, Leonid Peisakhin", "abstract": "The literature on the long-term effects of violence suggests that the original cleavage that gave rise to conflict is perpetuated through intergenerational transfer of ingroup-outgroup hatred between victims and perpetrators.

We study the legacy of a multidimensional conflict, the Spanish civil war, where the Left-Right ideological cleavage co-existed with the center-periphery divide. Leveraging a natural experiment of history and using panel data on voting and original survey data we show how in a multidimensional conflict a cleavage that pre-conflict was secondary became dominant in the aftermath of violence in response to changes in political discourse. Specifically, we demonstrate how communities that suffered more from Rightist violence became more supportive of regional autonomy rather than Leftist parties.

I do so using an original dataset on Members of Parliament (MPs) spanning more than two centuries (⇠1550–1750). Despite the dramatic expansion of trade during the period, I find that only a modest share of Parliament represented the commercial sector, and overseas traders never constituted a majority of commercial representatives. The parliamentary entré of trading interests manifested most acutely via investors in trade rather than active participants. Moreover, the growing Atlantic economy was associated with little turnover in MPs’ social and family backgrounds.

When potential security partners’ preferences are misaligned, this risk looms large, discouraging mutually beneficial investment in an alliance. How can a prospective ally credibly reassure an uncertain patron that their preferences align, to mitigate abandonment risks and elicit a security commitment? We show formally that pre-alliance bargaining with third parties is one way to do so. When the patron holds abandonment concerns, the prospective ally can reassure the patron by making greater concessions to the patron’s existing allies, but more hard-line demands of its rivals. This finding implies that the prospect of an alliance can alternately promote conflict with a prospective patron’s enemies and forestall conflict with its friends. Indeed, we show that incentives for pre-alliance reassurance can result in war, even with perfect asset divisibility, no commitment problems, and complete information among the belligerents.

I argue that poor crisis performance is more likely when a state’s bureaucracy provides incomplete or inaccurate information to leaders. Two characteristics of a state’s national security institutions—capacity for information search and interbureaucratic information sharing—shape the quality of information provision. Leaders are thus less likely to initiate international crises that fail to advance their goals when they sit atop institutions that ease transaction costs of relaying information to leaders and that allow bureaucracies to competitively evaluate each other’s information. To test my argument, I leverage data measuring bureaucratic institutions across the globe from 1946 to 2015. The analysis finds that crisis performance depends on institutional design, suggesting that some leaders are more prone that others to exhibit poor judgment in high-stakes international crises because of institutional constraints on their information. A case study on China’s decision-making prior to the Sino-Vietnamese War illustrates the theory’s mechanisms.

Our results show that referencing IO endorsements reduces resistance to the policy. Crucially, their impact is strongest when the IO is seen as aligned with national interests. In contrast, traits such as impartiality and technical expertise—emphasized in previous studies—play a more limited role. Moreover, the persuasive power of endorsements is concentrated among government supporters, further underscoring the importance of perceived interest alignment as a critical dimension of persuasiveness.

To illustrate, we introduce a new dataset of functional sovereignty over vehicle license plates, currency, passport issuance, postal service, and national Internet domains within unrecognized (de facto) states. We theorize disputes over these functions as not only a matter of practicality, but also as contestations over symbolic assertions of sovereign statehood. Analysis of de facto state governance over these five functions shows that contested territories collectively exhibit gradations of functional sovereignty, defying binary classifications. Further, we draw conceptual and empirical distinctions between functional sovereignty and proximate phenomena, including statehood, rebel governance, and global governance.

This study examines whether and under what conditions international advocacy influences citizens’ willingness to support sanctions. I hypothesize that advocacy effectiveness depends on who delivers the message, what type of violation is reported, and how the response is framed. I fielded a preregistered survey experiment with a sample of 2,204 Americans, varying the type of rights violation (physical integrity vs. empowerment rights), the advocacy messenger (UN Special Rapporteur vs. Human Rights Watch), and the sanctions framing (unilateral vs. multilateral). Results show that advocacy messages can increase public support for sanctions, but effects vary significantly across conditions. First, UN messaging produces robust effects, while Human Rights Watch messaging shows weaker and less consistent impacts. Second, messages describing physical integrity abuses generate strong support, while empowerment rights violations fail to mobilize public opinion. Contrary to expectations, multilateral framing does not significantly increase support.

Cassell", "abstract": "Conventional-politics approaches, emphasizing party ideology, electoral dynamics, committee membership, campaign donations, and industry clout, exercise a powerful hold over assessments of public policies and their distributional effects. Emerging from pluralist and business power perspectives, such accounts see “who gets what and why” as the result of how politics and power shape policies, their implementation, and distributional outcomes. This pervades our understanding of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), the US government’s effort to avert mass unemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic by lending $786 billion to small businesses to keep employees on the payroll. Yet contrary to prior studies of the PPP, we find that conventional-politics factors were strikingly uncorrelated with distributional outcomes, revealing limits to such approaches to this case. Instead, we find that an institutional politics or politics-in-time (IP-PIT) analysis better explains the program and its trajectories. IP-PIT revises the causal sequence by emphasizing how institutions and policies generate politics, distributional outcomes, and feedback loops. We engage both approaches via a mixed-methods analysis of the PPP and two new datasets. We conduct a qualitative process tracing of temporal variation in policy architectures, politics, policy revisions, and access to loans across the program’s three periods, and present quantitative analyses of loan flows across congressional districts and periods using data on the entire corpus of PPP loans. In so doing, we advance research and debate over the PPP, the dynamics and outcomes of US policy making during crises, and the American political economy in general. Ours is the first study of the PPP to conduct a mixed-methods analysis of loans across congressional districts or to use conventional and institutional approaches to address its politics, policy, and outcomes. More broadly, we document varieties of critical junctures, contribute arguments about what might shape policy or institutional innovation in those moments, and use the PPP to identify conditions under which systems are “their own grave diggers,” fueling negative-transformative rather than positive-reproductive feedback.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725102272", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725102272", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0068133929011862104}, {"title": "Codebook LLMs: Evaluating LLMs as Measurement Tools for Political Science Concepts", "authors": "Andrew Halterman, Katherine A.

To code these texts automatically, researchers are increasingly turning to generative large language models (LLMs).

To address this, we gather and curate three real-world political science codebooks—covering protest events, political violence, and manifestos—along with their unstructured texts and human-coded labels. We also propose a five-stage framework for codebook-LLM measurement: Preparing a codebook for both humans and LLMs, testing LLMs’ basic capabilities on a codebook, evaluating zero-shot measurement accuracy (i.e., off-the-shelf performance), analyzing errors, and further (parameter-efficient) supervised training of LLMs. We provide an empirical demonstration of this framework using our three codebook datasets and several pre-trained 7–12 billion open-weight LLMs. We find current open-weight LLMs have limitations in following codebooks zero-shot, but that supervised instruction-tuning can substantially improve performance.

It introduces discrepancy-based measures that capture these deviations relative to cumulative patterns of state violence, offering a context-sensitive alternative to conventional absolute measures such as fatality counts or arrests. Drawing on event-level data from ACLED, NAVCO, and SCAD, this article analyzes both country- and local-level panels using two-way fixed-effects regression and cumulative link mixed models. Across multiple datasets and specifications, the discrepancy measures consistently produce a U-shaped relationship: participation increases when repression is either higher or lower than established baselines. Comparisons with absolute measures show that the discrepancy approach more reliably explains variation in mobilization, helping to reconcile fragmented results in the repression–mobilization literature. These findings highlight the importance of expectations and contextual baselines in shaping how repression is interpreted and acted upon, suggesting that studies of contentious politics should move beyond static metrics toward measures that account for how actors evaluate state actions over time.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251381521", "doi": "10.1177/20531680251381521", "journal_full": "Research & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008814287266776688}, {"title": "The source of economic shocks matters for their political outcomes", "authors": "Leonardo Baccini, Costin Ciobanu, Krzysztof Pelc", "abstract": "Do different economic shocks favor different types of political leadership? Using a survey experiment conducted on 3500 American respondents, we offer causal evidence for an unexpected relation between different types of economic shocks and a demand for a radical political response. First, we show that individuals believe politicians have a role in preventing layoffs due to both offshoring and automation, compared to run-of-the-mill bankruptcies. Second, we find strong evidence that economic shocks due to offshoring lead to greater demands for leaders who display authoritarian traits, with no equivalent effect for layoffs due to automation. When presented with news of an offshoring event, respondents favor leaders who claim to be more willing to flout the rule of law, to implement divisive policies, and to employ force. By contrast, traits commonly associated with populism, such as siding with “the people” or preferring political outsiders, see no association with either offshoring or automation shocks. Our findings support the view that some economic shocks provide a greater opportunity for political candidates willing to turn to radical political solutions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251379914", "doi": "10.1177/20531680251379914", "journal_full": "Research & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006179749500179188}, {"title": "Differently Divisive Sexism, Racial Resentment, and Support for Candidates with Incongruent Views", "authors": "Gabriel Borelli, Rafaela Dancygier, Daniel Hopkins, Ryan Bell, Jeremy Roth", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1086/738701", "doi": "10.1086/738701", "journal_full": "The Journal of Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.05855033037531232}, {"title": "A Testament to Hope: The Natural Law Politics of Phillis Wheatley Peters’ Poetry", "authors": "Matthew K.

Humans have granted images the power to visually anticipate the future, which is traceable to the Palaeolithic but newly intensified in contemporary digital visual culture and platform economy. In this crosscurrent piece, we seek to interrogate the enduring and evolving nexus between images and anticipatory imaginaries and technologies, foregrounding what we refer to as anticipatory images : visual depictions of the not-yet with a performative effect in the present. We argue that images cannot be defined solely as representations of the outside world, as they also anticipate possible futures through acts of individual and collective imagination, thus acting out politics of temporality. Drawing on social theory on anticipation and visual culture and a selection of visual instances of anticipatory images, we highlight the sociocultural significance and role of anticipatory images as crucial analytical tools at the intersection of media studies, anthropology and social theory. Our aim is twofold: to reflect on how humans imagine and materialise anticipation through visual means and to unpack the politics embedded in contemporary anticipatory regimes by attending to visual culture, especially in the digital sphere, although not exclusively. Far from being confined to digital media, anticipatory images reflect a longer historical continuum of visualising futurity.

Using an online ethnography and Brock’s Critical Technocultural Discourse Analysis, I analyzed how Black Twitter users communicate to create a sense of place on the platform. Findings indicate that Black users experience time on social media in layered ways, such that they blend historical and contemporary cultural experiences to connect with one another and defend against outsiders. Extending previous work that examines Black Twitter as a cultural formation, this study explores two dimensions: (1) how Black users’ temporal practices challenge notions of digital behavior that reduce user agency and (2) how users perform boundary work by using the platform to defend themselves from outside influences. For example, #YourSlipisShowing enabled Black users to call attention to accounts posing as Black users, effectively turning a platform feature into a defense method. In addition, Black users often call on their collective memory to identify community members through shared cultural experiences and emotional connection. In some ways, Twitter supports the process of collective memory (re)production and engagement through platform features, such as retweets and non-chronological timelines.

This paper documents that short-time work affects the behaviour of firms (supply) and households (demand). First, using household survey data from Germany, we show that the consumption risk of short-time work is lower than that of unemployment. Second, we construct a New Keynesian model with heterogeneous workers and firms, incomplete asset markets, and labour market frictions.

But this assumption is not borne out by the data: goods priced in dollars tend to have more flexible prices, along with higher elasticities of substitution. We propose a model with more realistic assumptions and show that even with dollar pricing, depreciating the currency by loosening monetary policy can still boost exports and activity materially. The limit to any expansion is not demand, but supply capacity. We also show that low exchange-rate pass-through to dollar prices is not informative about price stickiness.

First, proxies of state capacity do not predict a higher likelihood of innovating new policies, but the political leaning of the state does predict a higher likelihood of introducing partisan laws since 1990. Second, the diffusion of policies from 1950 to 2000 is best predicted by proximity—a state is more likely to adopt a policy if nearby states have already done so—as well as similarity in voter policy preferences. Third, since 2000, party alignment has become the strongest predictor of diffusion, and the speed of adoption has increased. Models of learning and correlated preferences can account for the earlier patterns, but the findings for the last two decades indicate a sharply increasing role of party control.

We calibrate our economy to the euro area “stressed countries” in the debt crisis (2010–2). Substantial welfare gains are achieved, particularly in times of crisis.

In particular, we identify two separate strands in the literature: ‘demographic migrantisation’ and ‘categorical migrantisation’. The latter is most consequential for Migration Studies, and so forms the main focus of this article, along with two further contributions developing from the categorical migrantisation approach: ‘migrantisation as an analytical perspective’, and the recently introduced concept of ‘experiential migrantisation’. Our discussion foregrounds the multi-dimensional nature of categorical migrantisation, which takes place across multiple domains, and is intersectional and contextual in character. In creating a more systematic understanding of the concept of migrantisation, we hope to lay clearer foundations for future research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00497-1", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00497-1", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9952496871148455}, {"title": "Front stage contestation and back stage consultation: how Amsterdam navigated the governance of undocumented migrants", "authors": "Sander Mensink, Marlies Glasius, Imrat Verhoeven", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00492-6", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00492-6", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9849679560135212}, {"title": "Every creed and race find an equal place: understandings of race in Junior Panorama", "authors": "Stephanie R.

Drawing on 32 life history interviews conducted in Kabul, Herat, Kandahar and Balkh, and using Jørgen Carling's theoretical framework, the analysis shows that migration aspirations are not fleeting responses to crisis but enduring life strategies shaped by systemic exclusion, structural inequality and evolving socio‐political constraints. Aspirations persist and often intensify in the face of return, repression and limited legal pathways—prompting strategic recalibrations through educational migration, humanitarian routes and transnational networks. The study highlights the gendered dimensions of aspiration, particularly the growing role of migration as a means of resisting institutionalised restrictions on women.

I analyze EU–Tunisia relations through the lens of racial capitalism, arguing that Tunisia’s cooperation with external actors, including on migration matters, is connected to maintaining models of capitalist accumulation and punishing dissent. The aim of this contemporary cooperation is not to prevent the mobility of migrants entirely, but to limit, control, and exploit it. Both the EU and Tunisia suspend different racialized migrant groups in a situation of irregularity and precarity to create and maintain exploitable labor, while avoiding the political unpopularity of “regularizing” migrants. We are seeing the violent and deadly consequences of intensified racialized border regimes both within Europe, in the context of a contemporary crisis of neoliberalism, and in post-transition Tunisia, faced with its own overlapping social, political, and economic crises. Thus, by exploring the entanglements of racialized bordering practices that operate across the Mediterranean, I go beyond reductive state-by-state analysis, revealing EU externalization as part of a broader project of racialized bordering essential to global racial capitalism.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10020", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10020", "journal_full": "Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9640639698559266}, {"title": "Queer and Trans African Mobilities: Migration, Asylum and Diaspora.

While it is well established that disasters often exacerbate the vulnerabilities of displaced populations, less attention has been paid to how legal and bureaucratic regimes structure not only who can move, but also where they are permitted to go. Drawing on a review of literature on immigrants and refugees in disaster contexts and post-disaster mobility, as well as fieldwork based on in-depth interviews, we argue that legal status operates as a form of governance that constrains both mobility and its directionality. Although Syrians under Temporary Protection in Turkey possess legal status, their rights to relocate or access services are highly conditional and spatially circumscribed. The earthquake momentarily disrupted—but did not dismantle—these restrictions. The state selectively managed refugee movement, granting temporary permissions while blocking durable relocation to cities like Istanbul. Often seen as a space of refuge, Istanbul has increasingly become a site of exclusion. As such, the paper contributes to debates on legal status and mobility governance in disaster contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf058", "doi": "10.1093/jrs/feaf058", "journal_full": "Journal of Refugee Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9406166608204447}, {"title": "The ‘UNFAIR’ refugee agency: UNHCR accountability after protests and violence", "authors": "Peter Rees, Rachel Ibreck, Souhayel Weslety", "abstract": "Urban refugees increasingly resort to sit-ins outside United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) offices because they lack avenues for accountability.

We reflect on these findings and explore the possibility of transforming the agency’s accountability relations in the context of declining budgets and influence. We argue that the agency must abandon its securitized response to refugee-led protests and adopt a ‘networked accountability’ approach, engaging with the plural authorities that hold legitimacy in refugee protection.

However, these works often overlook intra‐country variation, which may play an important role in moderating that relationship. This study examines the heterogeneity in the educational gradient of fertility across Spain, a context characterized by lowest‐low and latest‐late fertility. Using data from the 2011 Spanish census, we reconstruct the reproductive history of 656,248 women aged 25–50, of whom 403,140 had become mothers. This large sample allows to analyze the educational gradient in first motherhood across Spanish provinces. To do so, we apply mixture cure models, which enable us to differentiate between the occurrence and the timing of the transition. The results reveal substantial regional variability in the educational gradient for both dimensions, although the association between the gradients in occurrence and timing is weak across space. We further find that cross‐province variation in the educational gradient in the timing of the transition is largely driven by the heterogeneous behavior of non‐university educated women, a pattern not observed for occurrence. Finally, we identify a negative association between the educational gradient and the province's GDP per capita, particularly strong for the timing of the transition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70106", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70106", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06558968131010556}, {"title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of social norms messaging approaches for improving health behaviours in developed countries", "authors": "Trisevgeni Papakonstantinou, Sarah Lynn Flecke, C.

We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials using social norms messaging in developed countries targeted at changing health behaviours among 16+-year-olds to evaluate their effectiveness. Relevant studies were identified through searches in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, TRIP, Cochrane and grey literature sources. Risk of bias was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A random-effects meta-analysis standardized effect sizes to Cohen’s d , assessed heterogeneity with I ² and applied robust Bayesian meta-analysis to adjust for publication bias. Searches resulted in 89 studies ( n = 85,759), which exhibited a small effect of social norms messaging on health behaviours (Cohen’s d = 0.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.09, 0.19], P &lt; 0.001). However, this effect disappeared after controlling for publication bias. We conducted moderator analyses, finding no significant differences from the overall effect for different types of social norms message, delivery modalities, health domains or target populations. The review is limited by the lack of studies assessing whether normative information changed participant perceptions, inconsistent use of manipulation checks, and high heterogeneity across studies in terms of target behaviour, population and intervention delivery, affecting the robustness of conclusions. Our analysis suggests that when appropriately controlling for publication bias, social norms messages are not effective at improving health behaviours.

Examples include working together on promoting conservation or habitat protection, the sharing of information, or the development of less polluting products or production processes. However, to date, the literature on environmental policy has considered only the incentives for individual parties (e.g., firms, landowners, or individuals) to take steps (i.e., exert “effort”) to reduce pollution or meet resource management goals where those steps impact that party’s own environmental footprint or performance. Missing from the literature is any consideration of the ability of one party to undertake activities that instead help another improve the latter’s performance. Such help could be either a substitute for or a complement to one’s own effort. This paper presents an analysis showing that traditional policy approaches based on individual performance cannot generally efficiently incentivize both effort and help, but a (properly designed) collective approach where rewards or punishments are based on group performance can. This suggests an additional rationale for the use of collective approaches as a potentially important tool for promoting sustainability that has not been recognized in the literature.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510162122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2510162122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008121551956556727}, {"title": "Within-country inequality and the shaping of a just global climate policy", "authors": "Marie Young-Brun, Francis Dennig, Frank Errickson, Simon Feindt, Aurélie Méjean, Stéphane Zuber", "abstract": "Climate policy design must balance emissions mitigation with concerns for fairness, particularly as climate change disproportionately affects the poorest households within and across countries. Integrated Assessment Models used for global climate policy evaluation have so far typically not considered inequality effects within countries. To fill this gap, we develop a global Integrated Assessment Model representing national economies and subnational income, mitigation cost, and climate damage distribution and assess a range of climate policy schemes with varying levels of effort sharing across countries and households. The schemes are consistent with limiting temperature increases to 2 °C and account for the possibility to use carbon tax revenues to address distributional effects within and between countries. We find that carbon taxation with redistribution improves global welfare and reduces inequality, with the most substantial gains achieved under uniform taxation paired with global per capita transfers. A Loss and Damage mechanism offers significant welfare improvements in vulnerable countries while requiring only a modest share of global carbon revenues in the medium term. The poorest households within all countries may benefit from the transfer scheme, in particular when some redistribution is made at the country level.

In this work, we estimate the causal effects of Community Notes, a novel fact-checking feature adopted by X (formerly Twitter) to solicit and vet crowd-sourced fact-checking notes for false content. We gather detailed time series data for 40,078 posts for which notes have been proposed and use synthetic control methods to estimate a range of counterfactual outcomes. We find that attaching fact-checking notes significantly reduces the engagement with and diffusion of false content. We estimate that, on average, the notes resulted in reductions of 46.1% in reposts, 44.1% in likes, 21.9% in replies, and 13.5% in views after being attached. Over the posts’ entire lifespans, these reductions amount to 11.6% fewer reposts, 13.3% fewer likes, 6.9% fewer replies, and 5.5% fewer views on average. In reducing reposts, we observe that diffusion cascades for fact-checked content are less deep and less “viral,” but not less broad, than synthetic control estimates for non-fact-checked content with similar reach.

Reservoir levels dropped below the 8% outlet threshold and groundwater in the main aquifer dropped to sea level in several locations, risking seawater intrusion. Socioeconomic impacts ranged from substantial crop losses to a potential long-term decline in regional economic viability. We examine the main drivers of this crisis using a coupled human and natural systems approach, combining an examination of water and land governance with analysis of time series (dam inflows and outflows, meteorological variables, reservoir, and groundwater levels) and spatial data (irrigated land use, groundwater bodies, water entitlement location, and volume). Our results show two severe meteorological droughts in close succession immediately preceding rapid declines in reservoir and groundwater reserves. Emergency measures delayed dam depletion but likely exacerbated groundwater extraction. Reservoir data disaggregating inflows, outflows, and uses (irrigation and urban) show an increasing trend in dam water use for irrigation in 2000–2022 associated with increasing irrigated area. Water management planning since 1998 reveals important inconsistencies within and between plans pointing to large uncertainties in freshwater availability and extraction and aquifer overdraft even during nondrought periods. The Axarquía case exhibits many symptoms of water crises faced by agriculturally significant regions globally. It highlights the necessity for integrated basin-scale land–water management, caps on irrigated area, flexible extraction quotas, real-time metering at all extraction points, and effective enforcement mechanisms, substantiating management lessons derived from major drought-affected regions worldwide.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2508055122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2508055122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.07556100171086866}, {"title": "Why depolarization is hard: Evaluating attempts to decrease partisan animosity in America", "authors": "Derek E.

Our meta-analysis reveals that the average effect of treatments on animosity is modest (a 5.4-point shift on a 101-point scale), and decays within two weeks. We experimentally test whether stacking multiple treatments in one sitting or repeating them over time as “booster shots” enhances their impact. We find no evidence that multiple or repeated exposures produce substantially larger or more durable reductions in partisan animosity. This reveals the uneven utility of these interventions. They serve as valuable tools for testing the psychological mechanisms of polarization, but our findings indicate they are not, on their own, a scalable solution for reducing societal-level conflict.

Consistent with this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of major explanatory transitions across the history of Western science revealed that initial scientific explanations systematically favored inherent properties, while subsequent explanations incorporated extrinsic factors more consistently. Seven experiments with lay participants (both adults and children; N = 1,673) and two experiments with practicing scientists from top departments worldwide ( N = 275) provided converging evidence for this bias and identified the psychological mechanisms involved. When explaining unfamiliar phenomena, even leading scientists showed a robust tendency to overweight inherent properties and underweight extrinsic factors relative to established scientific understanding. This bias appears rooted in basic cognitive constraints on attention and memory that excessively narrow the space of hypotheses initially considered.

We document that the policy reduced water pollution overall, targeting areas based on pollution level. Since high pollution areas tend to be wealthier, this policy concentrated firm water pollution abatement and reductions in polluting firm entry in higher-SES areas. While pollution fell, the policy further widened the gap in health and economic outcomes, particularly for those without tap water access: Disparities in risks of tumor, cardiovascular disease, labor supply, and wages increased.

Metabolic signals do not act on the brain in isolation; they are embedded within a broader interoceptive system through which the brain detects and interprets bodily states. This system supports allostasis, the brain’s predictive regulation of internal physiological demands.

Using qualitative data collected from the Chinese freight transportation sector, it argues that platform expansion has extensively weakened the pre-existing relational infrastructure of markets and replaced it with centralized digital infrastructures. This disruptive transformation harms truck drivers’ welfare through two mechanisms: (1) Enhanced market connectivity and anonymity intensify competition and reduce drivers’ income; (2) Bureaucratic, biased platform mediation replaces social, collaborative problem-solving, increasing risks for drivers. Both processes have undermined the relational, spatial boundaries of pre-existing social networks, thus breaking social safety nets and increasing economic insecurity for the less powerful actors. By examining a less-studied case in China, this research offers a novel perspective on the transformative power of digital platforms.

This study addresses these gaps by exploring the role of TSOs as intermediaries in co‐producing climate actions by empowering vulnerable communities. Through a case study of a project led by BRAC, a prominent hybrid TSO in Bangladesh, we find that creating a relational space for co‐production—in this case, Climate Action Groups—is the key strategy used to foster active engagement and build long‐term climate resilience. These spaces reach their full potential when intentionally supported by mechanisms such as awareness raising and shared goals, the incorporation of local knowledge, and inclusive engagement strategies. Our research contributes to the literature by demonstrating how TSOs facilitate meaningful co‐production with vulnerable groups, thereby broadening our understanding of their role in climate governance and providing a comprehensive, practice‐based model of sustainable, community‐led adaptation.

Especially on the issue of environmental protection, governments worldwide have sought to enhance their environmental governance efficiency by embedding the concepts, technologies, and methods of digital governance. However, while the potential benefits of digital governance embedding have garnered considerable academic attention, the associated implementation burdens it imposes on the public sector have received relatively little scrutiny or discussion. Based on panel data from 225 prefecture‐level cities in China from 2014 to 2022, this study empirically analyzes the impact of digital governance embedding on local government's environmental governance efficiency and unveils its mechanism from the perspective of implementation burden. The study found that: (1) Digital governance embedding has a “U‐shaped” impact on the environmental governance efficiency of local governments; (2) The implementation burdens arising from digital governance embedding constitute the core mechanism explaining this “U‐shaped” relationship; (3) Local governments' transformative public value preferences can mitigate the negative effects of implementation burdens on environmental governance efficiency.

Drawing from literature on representative bureaucracy and relational demography, we explore how leadership representation influences street-level bureaucrats’ views on diversity and representation within the organization.

Firstly, Black firefighters viewed the presence of a Black leader as empowering, leading to opportunities for professional advancement and a commitment to community representation. In contrast, White firefighters perceived race-based diversity efforts as undermining meritocracy. Secondly, White firefighters preferred to avoid having discussions about race and diversity within the workplace, often referring to their familial bond and collective firefighter identity that minimized racial differences among their colleagues. Moreover, White firefighters are colorblind until race poses a material threat to them. Black firefighters reported selectively engaging in discussions depending on the context or cultural environment, or avoiding conversations, especially when they perceived potential consequences.

Adopting an opt-out law, Singapore created a larger pool of legal organ donors yet generated worse donation outcomes than Taiwan, whose opt-in regulation has resulted in a smaller pool of potential organ donors. Drawing from interviews and archival research to solve this puzzle, I argue that moral infrastructure—the regulation-endorsed organizational arrangements to tackle cultural and emotional tensions—determines whether and when people change their minds regarding shared cultural norms. Singapore’s regulation prioritizes instrumental rationality and generates efficiency-driven organizational practices. These practices lead to affective circumvention , sidestepping emotions to expedite organ procurement and, in turn, prompting patients’ families to withdraw from hospital care. By contrast, in Taiwan, relational reasoning creates arrangements that promote affective coordination , a process that empowers intermediaries to work with grieving families and morally reframe donation.

Missing from these studies is an engagement with racism in its modern form, which is often more “color-blind,” or hidden, rather than overtly expressed, and thus can be more difficult to capture. In this study, I ask the following questions: (1) What role do racialization processes play in attitudes toward migrants? and (2) Do these processes vary across different questions of acceptance? To answer these questions, this study utilizes Duboisian insight to argue that, while White attitudes toward non-White migrants may be positive in the abstract, when Whites are forced to give up their symbolic and material power in the process, this positive reception wanes. The study utilizes a conjoint design experimental online survey to test the acceptance of migrants applying for refugee status across multiple outcomes: (1) legal acceptance, which measures the acceptance across the physical border, and (2) symbolic acceptance, which measures the acceptance into American society. These findings replicate prior research in finding no significant difference between the legal acceptance of White and non-White migrants among White respondents.

However, research so far mainly applied variable-centered analyses which neglect that there might be different ways in which Muslim minority members combine their religiosity and attitudes towards individual (sexual) liberties and gender equality. To provide a more differentiated understanding of these complex associations, we conduct a person-centered analysis and identify different subgroups in the Turkish- and Moroccan-origin oversample of the Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study (NELLS 2011, N = 1829). Two subgroups confirm findings from variable-centered approaches: we find a profile that combines high levels of religiosity with low acceptance of sexual liberalism, and one with the opposite pattern of low religiosity but high levels of acceptance of sexual liberalism and gender equality. A sizable additional subgroup combines high levels of religiosity with acceptance of homosexuality, and to a lesser extent divorce and chosen childlessness. Our findings suggest that the acceptance of homosexuality is particularly relevant in differentiating between subgroups of Muslims, whereas attitudes towards gender equality do not differ remarkably between profiles.

And on knowledge of both basic civics and current politics, atheists/agnostics’ advantage is strongest among liberals and Democrats and disappears among conservatives and Republicans. A similar pattern appears for evangelical Protestants in the opposite direction with their scores on both civics and current politics increasing significantly as they identify more with ideological conservatism, but this does not apply to partisan identity. Findings extend literatures on political knowledge, religious/secular political engagement, and partisan sorting by showing that (1) self-identified secular Americans, particularly if they are sorted, tend to be the most knowledgeable about basic civics and current political conditions, and (2) this pattern is to a weaker extent mirrored by evangelicals, another politicized religious group.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf150", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf150", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.014177113325112178}, {"title": "Confronting the past in a polarized present: holocaust representations motivate people for symbolic justice and against antisemitism", "authors": "Berenike Firestone, Ruth Ditlmann, Oguzhan Turkoglu", "abstract": "Awareness of past atrocities is widely seen as critical for restoring justice and building resilient democracies.

At a time of heightened concern for political violence in the US, we assess individual-level associations between self-reported approval of the NRA and support for political violence, willingness to engage in political violence, and attitudes and beliefs linked to political violence. Methods: Findings are for respondents to Wave 2 (conducted May 18-June 8, 2023) of a nationally representative longitudinal general population survey; participants are members of Ipsos KnowledgePanel.

On the other hand, these institutions tend not to guarantee, for example, greater political diversity and greater democratic plurality. Therefore, I particularly propose inclusion through decentralization by means of a federalist model, considering the transformation of the current republic into a Federation of Angolan States. Examples of countries that have adopted the federalist model show the great capacity for transformation provided by federalist decentralization.

Angola, particularly with a federalist model, could provide structural and regional balance. For example, the regions could drive sustainable regional economic development with greater rigor, while public finances could optimize fiscal policy and budgetary policy could converge with medium- and long-term objectives. Thus, through a federalist model, economic transformations tend to be inclusive, especially based on institutional dynamics and sustainable growth.

Existing research predominantly focuses on macro-policy levels, lacking systematic quantitative analysis of event-level diplomatic activities. This study seeks to fill this gap. Methodologically, it employs an event-level observation-computational empirical design, constructing five-layer networks (administrative, legislative, multilateral, social, and media) and time series based on open-source intelligence (OSINT). The analytical process follows the HCLS paradigm: identifying structural hubs (Hub) via the Bridge Center Early Warning Index (BCEW), detecting rhythmic inflection points (Change) using CUSUM, BOCPD, and PELT methods, characterizing lead-response lag relationships (Lag) between issues through cross-correlation and Hawkes processes, and translating multidimensional evidence into issue priority scores (Score) using AHP→TOPSIS. (Score). Results indicate that the administrative and multilateral layers exhibit significant hub status within the network, while security and multilateral issues show statistically significant rhythmic inflection points within short-term windows. “Security→Administrative” and “Multilateral→UN-ESCAP” demonstrate strong coupling at zero lag, whereas legislative channel coupling is weaker and transient. Multi-criteria ranking indicates that security, digital cooperation, and multilateral rules form the priority issue sequence, remaining robust to weight perturbations. Integrating four evidence chains reveals that China's recent diplomatic focus toward Thailand centers on amplifying issue linkage through administrative and multilateral platforms, gradually shifting toward narrative coupling of rule-building and public diplomacy in the medium term. In conclusion, this study not only proposes a reproducible, falsifiable event-level diplomatic analysis methodology but also reveals the logical chain of “hub prioritization—issue triggering—platform amplification—narrative coupling—trend insight” in China-Thailand relations.

Using a simulated dataset spanning three divisions (Energy, Materials, Consumer), we compare outcomes under conventional accounting and an ESG-adjusted framework that includes carbon pricing equivalents, compliance costs, worker and governance programs. Our results show that ESG adjustments increase reported costs by approximately 20-30% and reduce operating margins by 5-7 percentage points, while significantly improving transparency across environmental, social, and governance metrics. Sensitivity analyses (varying carbon pricing) indicate that margin declines are robust to plausible environmental cost changes, though divisions with higher emissions are most affected.

The model shows that public coordination reduces variance in received care, increasing the likelihood that vulnerability becomes productive. Empirically, we combine two approaches. First, we analyze World Values Survey data from 25 countries (2017–2022), linking individual attitudes to a novel folktale-based index that captures the cultural salience of care-related virtues versus harm-related vices. Countries scoring higher on this index show greater support for redistributive care; civic participation also plays an independent role. Second, an incentivized framing experiment in Italy reveals that framing care as a private responsibility reduces donations to a pooled care fund by 6–8 percentage points.

This investigation rationalizes the structural, symbolic and interpersonal violence experienced across the life course of Bangladeshi FSWs. The population characteristics of low educational attainment and high marital separation are contextualized through a structural violence of embodied inequality perspective that substantiates the influence of childhood marriages that push Bangladeshi women into the sex trade. Bourdieu's theory of symbolic violence is used to conceptualize the material harms derived from the portrayal of FSWs as fallen women divorced from the virtuous ideals of the normative gender identity. The analysis contends that the intersections of structural and symbolic violence act to legitimize and perpetuate interpersonal assaults that oppress the body, suppress the voice and repress the spiritual soul of FSWs in Bangladesh. These sociostructural complexities pragmatically challenge the individualized perspectives of biobehavioral research that monitor the effectiveness of proximal interventions designed to correct recidivistic behaviors.

Here, we determine the essential dimensions of the space of fictional characters in film, television, and literature. We draw on a data set comprising 464 crowd-sourced semantic-differential traits scored for 2000 characters across 341 stories. On performing dimensional reduction and studying the alignment of traits and characters, we find that twelve archetypes afforded by six essential dimensions dominate the makeup of characters. We interpret these six dimensions as three primary dimensions expressed as semantic differentials of base archetypes: 1. {Fool ⇔ Hero}, 2. {Angel ⇔ Demon}, 3. {Traditionalist ⇔ Adventurer}; and three secondary dimensions: 4. {Lone Wolf ⇔ Diva}, 5. {Outcast ⇔ Sophisticate}, 6. {Brute ⇔ Geek}. We find that the three primary dimensions of character space are congruent with the three dimensions of essential meaning: 1. {weak ⇔ powerful}, 2. {safe ⇔ dangerous}, and 3. {structured ⇔ unstructured}. We also observe that the ‘Big Five’ personality traits are covered by these six essential dimensions, showing that fictional characters, however outsized, reflect everyday people. In considering combinations of the six essential dimensions, we generate an expanded set of 232 archetypes (e.g., Traditionalist-Demon-Hero ).

Employing a mixed-methods approach, including literature review, surveys, and interviews—the study examines how Chinese-language users perceive and conceptualize Chinese autism-related terms like GuDuZheng (孤独症, GDZ, “GuDu” means “isolation/loneliness” and “Zheng” means disease/symptoms) and ZiBiZheng (自闭症, ZBZ, “ZiBi” means “self closing-off”), as well as their extended versions. Through community collaboration and reflexive thematic analysis, the study addresses how these terms reflect broader social constructs of autism and how autistic individuals engage with diagnostic labels. The findings reveal that “Terms Are Socially Constructed” and “The Concept of Autism in the Chinese Context Has Been Typified as ZiBi (Self-closeness).” Despite societal stigmatization, individuals navigate these challenges by actively engaging with the diagnoses to reinterpret their implications within both Eastern and Western understandings. Drawing from Chinese philosophy such as “The unity of heaven and man,” “The equality of all beings,” and “The harmony,” individuals reconstruct personal narratives that counter mainstream discourses, fostering internal coherence and harmonious interpersonal interactions. As one participant articulated, “Loneliness embodies holistic completeness: Like Zhuangzi’s useless tree thriving in the wilderness, Buddhism’s suchness without fabrication, or Stoic’s alignment with natural reason.” To achieve this completeness, participants advocated that “Everyone from the Community Should Work Together,” suggesting concrete action steps for dismantling structural ableism. This study offers new insights into the development of an indigenous neurodiversity paradigm that resonates with the Chinese socio-linguistic context. It facilitates a quadruple dialogue between Eastern and Western, between researchers and community, among neurodiverse individuals, and between autistic individuals and diagnostic labels. Ultimately, this process enables the reclamation of cultural and individual autonomy in the Global South, empowering autistic individuals to reclaim narrative agency and enhance their well-being.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e6cg8_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/e6cg8_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.05258352810763223}, {"title": "The Subconscious Architecture Theory: A Research Agenda for Investigating Consciousness as an Environmental Construction", "authors": "Maxwell J Harrell", "abstract": "Human consciousness may represent a constructed neural interface rather than a foundational cognitive architecture.

In China, as more people are graduating from college with its expansion, the higher education institution plays an increasingly important role in determining social stratiﬁcation and mobility. In my thesis, I look at how higher education aﬀects earnings inequality by family backgrounds and gender, the two critical aspects of social division. In Chapter1, I start by exploring the economic return of the super-elite colleges – Tsinghua University and Peking University – by family background. The conclusion is that only individuals from privileged family backgrounds beneﬁt from having attended a prestigious college. Then I investigate how college aﬀects the gender pay gap in China, in an era when women have outperformed men in gaining college access. In Chapter 2, I look more closely at the social backgrounds of college students by gender and ﬁnd that girls have better socioeconomic backgrounds than their male counterparts. The predicted gender pay gap for college graduates rises when family background disparities between the sexes are considered. Chapter 3 ﬁnds that, despite the rising of women in college attendance, men and women are becoming more segregated in terms of their majors. A large proportion of the gender pay gap among college graduates is explained by the concentration of women in less lucrative non-STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) majors.

Background The distinction between kin and non-kin lies at the heart of sociological theories of family, reciprocity, and social obligation. Survey instruments rely on self-reports that may mask the existence of extended family ties. A population-scale family network can help better understand this measurement challenge. Methods A population scale family network is linked to records of every government-compensated informal care relation involving recipients over age 65. This sociocentric kinship network allows for measuring family network distance and classifying caregivers as direct kin, extended kin, or true non-kin, and measure family network distance for all ties. Logistic regression models compare caregiver characteristics between extended kin and true non-kin to validate the criterion validity. Results Around one-third of presumed non-kin caregivers are extended kin rather than non-kin—separated by two degrees in the family network. These extended kin are more distant than direct kin (e.g., cousins) but far closer than the general population. They also display caregiving patterns more akin to family, including heavier care loads and greater co-residence. True non-kin caregivers face distinct constraints, like greater geographical distance and age-related barriers.

A major driver of these inefficiencies is shortage gaming, a phenomenon where customers exaggerate orders during actual or perceived shortages in anticipation of rationing. This behaviour distorts demand signals, complicates production planning, and increases inventory and operational costs, thereby undermining firm performance. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between shortage gaming, as a dimension of the bullwhip effect, and the performance of food and beverage manufacturing firms in Kenya. The study adopted a descriptive research design anchored in a post-positivist philosophy, targeting 217 food and beverage firms registered with the Kenya Association of Manufacturers. A sample of 208 respondents comprising logistics and procurement managers was selected using Yamane’s formula and simple random sampling. Primary data was collected through structured and unstructured questionnaires, and reliability was confirmed using Cronbach’s Alpha (α ≥ 0.7). Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and multiple regression analysis with the aid of SPSS software. The findings revealed that shortage gaming significantly influences firm performance. Customers’ exaggerated orders and promotional mechanisms such as discounts and rebates were found to create artificial demand spikes, leading to inefficiencies in production planning and inventory management. Regression results indicated a strong positive correlation (R = 0.871) and high explanatory power (R² = 0.759), confirming that 75.9% of the variation in firm performance is explained by shortage gaming practices.

In this paper, we investigate this issue using the example of monthly earnings and Mincer-style regressions, which are applied to survey data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) linked with administrative data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Assuming that administrative earnings information reflects true earnings, we show that individuals typically underreport short-term earnings changes in survey data, which can lead to increasing biases with shorter panel durations. We demonstrate that this problem is substantially mitigated when using fixed-effects models, particularly when longer panels are available.

Findings highlight that online platforms provide survivors with new opportunities to share experiences, overcome stigma, and mobilize solidarity across geographic and social divides. Hashtags and viral campaigns were perceived as powerful tools for raising awareness, amplifying marginalized voices, and pressuring institutions to acknowledge gender-based violence.

This paper investigates the relationship between technology adoption and urban mobility dynamics, framing the exploration within the ’mobilities turn’ conceptual framework. We introduce the Digital Mobility Model (DMM)—an agent-based model designed to explore how digital technologies influence individual mobility patterns and delve into how technological advancements could shape or reshape inequalities at the urban level. The DMM employs the concept of ”learning by moving,” wherein individuals acquire digital skills during their mobility experiences, thereby affecting their ability to access digitally enabled places. The model simulates the interaction between individuals (i.e., dynamic agents) and places (i.e., static agents) demonstrating how technology adoption dynamics result in unequal mobility patterns, which in turn impact access to urban services. As such the DMM provides a novel theoretical framework, bridging mobility studies and ICT approaches, and underscores its potential for understanding the evolving landscape of digital inequalities in urban contexts, which contributes to ongoing discussions on mobility, technology, and societal transformations.

Using standard logistic regression models to analyze the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES) data, the study finds that hostility toward the Republican Party is positively associated with Black turnout rates more than warmth toward the Democratic Party.

Its opposite is not irrationality, but interruption—a motivational collapse experienced as profound confusion. This framework reveals that economic expansion is a function of cultivated interest, while contraction and alienation are the results of its systemic interruption. We argue that the painful social experience of economic humiliation is the consequence of a system that generates chronic interruption at the core of motivation.

Moving beyond a mere accounting of decline, we argue that the available data itself serves as a powerful indicator of state collapse. The systematic erosion of national-level educational statistics mirrors the disintegration of government capacity, forcing a reliance on fragmented humanitarian snapshots that document interventions, not a national system. Our findings reveal a sector in profound disrepair: an estimated 4.5 million out-of-school children, widespread destruction of school infrastructure necessitating temporary learning spaces, and the complete dependence of the teaching workforce on externally-funded incentives rather than state salaries. The data consistently shows entrenched gender disparities, exacerbated by negative coping mechanisms like child labor and marriage.

I then establish a philosophical threshold for moral agency by synthesizing Humean, Kantian, and phenomenological perspectives, arguing that agency requires affective sentiment, rational autonomy and subjective, temporal experience—all of which are absent in LLMs. Using a Jungian framework, I re-interpret studies on “deceptive” and “scheming” AI not as discoveries of emergent malice, but as manifestations of the projection of our own “Shadow” onto an opaque technological artifact. This misinterpretation leads to dangerous, quasi-mythological narratives of AI risk, exemplified by reports such as 'AI 2027'.

Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on patent data from the PatentSight database (2015–2024), we construct an SDG–technology mapping matrix covering 100 technology categories across 13 SDGs. We develop and apply the Technology Contribution Index (TCI), which integrates coverage, patent volume, diversity, and contribution intensity. Additionally, cosine similarity is applied to capture interlinkages among SDGs. Findings: The results reveal marked heterogeneity in technological engagement across the SDGs. SDG 09 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), SDG 07 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 13 (Climate Action) dominate in portfolio size and form a tightly interconnected cluster, whereas socially oriented goals such as SDG 05 (Gender Equality) and SDG 01 (No Poverty) remain weakly supported by patents. Large-scale, general-purpose technologies (e.g., Advanced Manufacturing, Blockchain, Internet of Things) provide broad systemic support across multiple SDGs, while specialized technologies (e.g., Clean Cooking, Sex-Disaggregated Data Management) play indispensable roles in individual goals. These findings highlight the coexistence of systemic platforms and niche drivers in the global innovation ecosystem. Research limitations:Patent data may underrepresent non-technological contributions to socially oriented SDGs (e.g., equity, education, institutional reform), which rely more heavily on policy, cultural, or behavioral interventions.

These results reveal multiple pathways to lasting co-management, refine hypotheses for future research, and show how tracking persistence supports adaptive, context-specific interventions for durable and equitable conservation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r6ypf_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/r6ypf_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007847234540095172}, {"title": "Navigating and Negotiating Sexual Identity and Attraction: A Queer Analysis of Heterosexual-Identified Men Who Have Sex with Men", "authors": "Megan W. Rowe, Sandra Kwan, Salem Rao, Adam Busch, Daniel Vandervoort, Paul A. Shuper, Travis R. Scheadler, Andrew David Eaton", "abstract": "Heterosexual-identified men who have sex with men (H-MSM) defy dominant sexuality frameworks that assume coherence between sexual identity, attraction, and behaviour. While extant models of sexual minority and heterosexual identity and attraction presume that H-MSM experience identity confusion and crisis and that ‘primarily or mostly heterosexual men’ exhibit equal levels of opposite-sex arousal as exclusive heterosexuals but report lower levels of same-sex sexuality than bisexuals in their attractions, fantasies, and behaviours, little research has examined how H-MSM experience sexual identity and attraction. This article is framed by Queer Theory and utilizes interpretative phenomenology to explore how a qualitative sample of 10 H-MSM navigate and negotiate their sexual identity and attraction. Results demonstate that H-MSM situate their same-sex attraction as physical, situational, and exploratory while employing gendered and relational scripts. At the same time, H-MSM sustain their heterosexual identity by decoupling identity from attraction and negotiating identity through heteroromantic desire. These findings demonstrate how sexuality is lived as fluid, shifting, and contingent, rather than as a linear trajectory toward categorical resolution. Unlike stage-based models that interpret identity-attraction-behaviour discordance as confusion or denial, participants described their identities as coherent, meaningful, and grounded in their romantic and long-term commitments to women. Same-sex attraction was acknowledged but framed as separate from participants’ perceived emotional weight of heterosexual relationships. By illustrating how individuals actively weigh and assign meaning to different aspects of sexuality, the study broadens understandings of sexual identity and attraction.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rgmun_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/rgmun_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.030146474965781267}, {"title": "Equity, accessibility, and public health implications of digital platforms delivering realtime air quality information: A systematic technology review", "authors": "Kayla Schulte, Adam Brighty, Will Francis, Andrew Grieve", "abstract": "According to the World Health Organisation, air pollution constitutes the largest environmental risk to health globally, with 99% of the world’s population residing in areas exceeding recommended guidelines; the provision of real-time air quality information through mobile or web-based applications, accompanied by behavioural guidance, offers a critical strategy for reducing individual exposures and improving population health outcomes. This type of information is provided at different geographic and temporal scales and has become increasingly common and decentralised over time. As a result, there is a gap in knowledge about the quality, characteristics, and effects of digitally available air quality information and messaging, which has the potential to protect public health. This study addresses this gap by conducting a systematic technology review of publicly available digital platforms, or “channels”, that share real-time information and data about localised air pollution levels. Using the UK as a case example, computational methods were leveraged to examine how the data underpinning existing digital air quality information channels (websites, mobile applications, sensors, etc.) is generated, and by which entities. This involved systematic searches of Google, the Google Play Store (Android), and Apple App Store (iOS) using SerpAPI meta search engine software and a list of search terms. 146 channels meeting the inclusion criteria were retained and included in the review. Summary statistics from channel metadata show trends surrounding the prevalence of certain types of channels, changes in characteristics channels over time, and other emerging patterns across the information landscape. This review also examines channel specific differences in available information, however, was limited to AQ channels accesible in the UK and excluded real-time social media data due to cost and access constraints. Lastly, the review considers demographic and other social factors that can affect when, where, and how air quality information and exposure reducing benefits are accessed. Findings from this work contribute to knowledge surrounding the production and consumption of digitally available air quality information with global health protective potential.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x36fg_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/x36fg_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009189491309050446}, {"title": "The Intercultural Ethics of AI-Driven Mobile Language Translation: A Diffractive Reading of Contemporary Discourses on a ‘Trustworthy AI’", "authors": "Dominic Busch", "abstract": "How do users experience AI-driven mobile language translation services in informal settings and how can these scenarios be assessed in the light of intercultural ethics?

However, these discourses mainly focus on epistemological issues whereas posthumanist thought in intercultural ethics encourages experiencing these phenomena from a less anthropocentric, decolonised and more ontological stance.
