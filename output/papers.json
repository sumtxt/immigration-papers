We argue that the heavily right‐skewed wealth distributions observed in contemporary societies translate into similarly skewed distributions of campaign resources. Such unequal resources mean that greater pressures to spend on campaigns disproportionately benefit the very wealthy. We also identify several conditions that determine the extent of the financing advantages of the very rich, and at whose expense they accrue. We test our propositions using a unique original data set on the wealth of more than 23,000 national legislators from 41 countries, as well as by exploiting quasi‐random variation in financing pressures provided by recent campaign finance reforms in Brazil and Chile. The analyses consistently show that greater financing pressures lead to greater shares of wealthy, and especially very wealthy legislators, and that these advantages vary in ways consistent with our predictions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12996", "doi": "10.1111/ajps.12996", "journal_full": "American Journal of Political Science", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010418693434296467}, {"title": "What Is the Point of Harm Reduction?

First, I provide a systematic analysis of the core features and normative commitments of harm reduction. Second, I propose a novel, relational egalitarian justification for harm reduction. I argue that the provision of harm reduction services is not solely or primarily a matter of mitigating the negative consequences associated with high-risk behaviours.

A focus on relations, rather than entities or things, encourages us to consider how these relations are developed, nurtured, ruptured, and restored, and to examine both the conditions and affordances of these processes.

Using new, more precise, and comprehensive data and measures, this study directly compares these competing arguments globally. The study finds that both economic and logistical factors affected violence and that violence was lower overall in the short and long term.

This paper expands the analysis to state legislatures, using an original dataset of 2056 top chamber and party leaders in 50 states from 1999 to 2023. Simulations reveal that state legislative leaders are consistently moderate relative to their caucus. Furthermore, while Democratic leaders consistently occupy the moderate left side of their caucus, Republican leaders do not show the same pattern, with some even positioned to the left of their caucus median. Beyond this overall pattern, there is substantial variation in leader‐caucus ideological divergence. The analysis shows that increasingly distinct and homogeneous majority parties—fulfilling the conditions of conditional party government theory—are consistently associated with leader moderation. However, this effect is stronger for Republicans than for Democrats, which is inconsistent with the theory's predictions of party symmetry. Finally, using a new dataset on majority party roll rates, the spatial divergence of majority party leaders from their caucuses is found to lead to significant failures of agenda control, with a substantial increase in majority party rolls for moderate Republicans but not for Democrats. This finding contradicts the predictions of party cartel theory, which suggests no differences in agenda control based on leader ideology or party.

Leveraging a set of forty-one in-depth interviews with Black and White residents of Evanston, Illinois—the first municipality in the United States to approve a publicly-funded reparations-related ordinance—we highlight a mechanism through which individuals develop their opinions about reparations: political socialization. Black interviewees linked their understanding of reparations to robust financial compensation while White Democrats viewed their support for Evanston’s policy as symbolic of their longstanding, affective commitments to racial equality. Drawing from these observations, we present a framework highlighting policy attributes that frame how different constituencies respond to reparations-related policies. We test this framework using a conjoint experiment about reparations policies fielded in the 2022 Cooperative Election Study. We find Americans—especially White Republicans—possess less familiarity about reparations and remain strongly opposed to these policies, regardless of the form they take.

These concerns, however, are primarily based on anecdotal evidence, aggregate measures related to political competition, or survey data that aim at eliciting public opinion. We adopt a different approach and look at polarization among the political elite. We examine the degree of consensus in parliamentary voting in the Polish parliament between 2005 and 2023. We find that political polarization was on the rise and that reaching agreement between the parties was more difficult when the votes concerned economic issues. Our results also demonstrate that voting in Parliament essentially became one-dimensional in that it was mainly driven by the government-opposition divide. We also document that voting against the party line was extremely rare, whether the MPs were in the government or an opposition party. This suggests that party discipline may be an important driver of political polarization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01307-z", "doi": "10.1007/s11127-025-01307-z", "journal_full": "Public Choice", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01462538148559478}, {"title": "Why so many representatives?

Through a novel survey experiment, we examine public opinion on 6-week versus 12-week abortion bans in this new context, testing whether 12-week bans are perceived as a more moderate position and garner greater support. Surprisingly, we find that Americans do not meaningfully distinguish between 6-week and 12-week bans. This suggests that attempts by some Republican officials to navigate the post-Dobbs landscape by proposing “moderate” abortion restrictions may be ineffective. However, we find that framing does matter: pro-life framing of bans increases support for candidates who endorse them, while pro-choice framing increases support for candidates who oppose them. Overall, our findings indicate that in the post-Dobbs era, the abortion debate has largely been flattened to a binary of “ban” versus “no ban,” rather than distinctions between ban timelines.

Even in Western Europe, one of the most rapidly secularising areas of the world, far right actors claim to defend Christian values against the alleged threat of Islam and Muslim immigrants, a rhetorical strategy known as ‘Christianism’. Yet, little is known about how religiosity, Islamophobia, and populist far-right ideology are connected at the level of mass belief systems in Western Europe. Most of the literature is focused either on religiosity’s effect on voting or on the connection between religiosity and ethnic prejudice, without considering religiosity’s relationships with the wider spectrum of far-right ideology. The present article fills this gap by analysing survey data from Britain, France, Germany, and the Netherlands. It uses SEM to uncover the relationships between Christian religiosity on the one hand and Islamophobia and far-right attitudes on the other. The results are broadly similar across different contexts: religiosity is mostly unrelated to Islamophobia, nativism, right-wing authoritarianism, and populism. Conversely, Islamophobia overlaps considerably with both nativism and authoritarianism: people who perceive immigration as a threat and favour strict laws and harsh enforcement also tend to reject Islam, but not for religious reasons. This pattern is compatible with the strategy of Christianism, which is largely devoid of religiosity, yet facilitates the “othering” of Muslims as a cultural out-group. It also helps to explain why there is no genuine, electorally relevant religious far right in Western Europe.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251351895", "doi": "10.1177/20531680251351895", "journal_full": "Research & Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.900151227135008}, {"title": "State Action and Moral Attitudes toward Sexual Consent", "authors": "Eli Baltzersen, Francesca R.

Instead, the political terrain is shaped by the preferences of homeowners and their children, who have a strong material interest in lower inheritance taxes.

Emerging from scholarly dialogues initiated in 2021, this framework challenges the Euro-American dominance often found within queer studies by centring the intricate, fluid intersections of ‘queernesses’ and ‘Asias’. We argue for examining how media technologies and transnational cultural flows across diverse Asian contexts shape, circulate and contest queernesses and Asian-nesses, offering rich ground for epistemological and methodological innovation. Building upon the discourse of ‘Asia as Method’, this approach positions Asia not merely as a source of data but as a critical vantage point for decolonising knowledge production and interrogating established epistemes. The introduction highlights the significance of inter-Asian referencing, the role of media as both terrains of struggle and tools for generating transformative momentum. The collection also highlights the precarious labour of marginalised scholars navigating institutional erasure and geopolitical violence, framing ‘Queer Asia as Method’ as both an insurgent academic project and a call for interdisciplinary, anti-colonial solidarity. We frame the subsequent essays in the themed section, which critique the coloniality embedded in dominant queer studies from their situated queernesses in Asias, advocating instead for methods that foreground situational, transcolonial and embodied experiences, ranging from techno-Orientalism, and queer entrepreneurship in China to hybrid languages in Indian film, and pedagogical affects in Indonesia, demonstrating the polyvocality and critical potential of Queer Asia as Method.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251351143", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251351143", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.22500613258254065}, {"title": "Queer techno-orientalism as method: Mr. Robot, Uterus Man , and other Chinese techno futures", "authors": "Ian Liujia Tian", "abstract": "This article inter-references Asian North American theorizing of techno-orientalism and queer Asia as method.

It argues that Chinese queer and trans bodies can reclaim a reparative techno future beyond these two dominant frames.

From the viewpoint of a non-academic with scholarly training and drawing on my pedagogical experience in queer studies, I introduce three additional elements to Queer Asia as Method. First, the notion “internationalist localism” emphasizes a strategic utilization of diverse queer knowledge from various locations, including US queer studies, without imposing a totalizing perspective. This move challenges the simplistic binary of “Western/colonializer” and “local/colonized.” Second, the Indonesia case demonstrates the potential to challenge the conventional notion of “Asia(ness),” questioning the idea that Asia and Indonesia are a fixed entity. Third, while the rising anti-LGBT sentiment generates creative pedagogical approaches that transcend traditional academic institutions, these practices are intertwined with the precarity of the actors involved. Unequal access to knowledge resources and publishing platforms, alongside the predominance of English as the language of academic legitimacy, compels us to center precariousness within the broader conceptualization of Queer Asia.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251349987", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251349987", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.32841984655573675}, {"title": "In search of a queer language in contemporary India: Languages ‘upside down’ as resistance to Euro-American universalisms", "authors": "Kaustav Bakshi", "abstract": "Emptying language of heterologocentrism has been a concern for queers for a long time.

The first is used by an underprivileged class of sexually non-conforming individuals – by the hijra/kothi/dhurrani communities since the 19th century, and other was fashioned by a radical poetic community in the 14th century – each informed by an erotic excess that contest colonial, bourgeois sexual puritanism which was liable in marginalizing, oppressing and eliminating queer lives. The article while critically discussing these two languages as a possibility of decolonizing queer languages in India, it also looks at the pitfalls of doing so in the era of unprecedented rise of the right-wing and their every trick to co-opt the queer.

This framework positions certain T (masculine-presenting women) as preferable intimate partners over their male counterparts, who are often associated with infidelity due to the pressures of “entrepreneur masculinity”.

Informed by a decolonial feminist perspective, we conceptualize the “Good Woman of Tibet” focusing on two cultural imaginaries, lhamo (the Goddess) and srinamo (the Demoness), to explore the landscape of #LamuAct and how Tibetan women from rural regions of Southwest China understand DV. Through the thematic analysis of social media discourses and 21 in-depth interviews, the results show how social media discourse and local narratives intersect and diverge in shaping contemporary Tibetan women’s understanding of DV. The significant divergence between online and offline narrative surrounding the srinamo imaginary reveals a complex ambivalence toward powerful women—who symbolize resistance against traditional Tibetan patriarchy and embody the agency to voice experiences of DV.

The outside option principle (OOP) predicts that the seller trades with the high-value buyer with probability converging to 1 at a price converging to max (h/2,l) as players become patient. While this prediction is supported by the Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), a wide range of trading outcomes may emerge in subgame perfect equilibria (SPEs): in the patient limit, the seller can obtain any price in the interval [h/2,h] (and no other); moreover, allocative inefficiency and costly delay are possible. We propose equilibrium refinements less restrictive than Markov behavior that guarantee trading outcomes consistent with the OOP. One refinement requires that a buyer's relative probability of trade does not increase dramatically following a failed negotiation with that buyer. Another refinement posits that the seller does not approach a buyer hoping that negotiations fail. SPEs satisfying both refinements conform with the OOP (but need not be MPEs).

Liu, Clare Xiaoqian Wan", "abstract": "By examining China’s refugee policies from 1949 to 1982, this article demonstrates how the Chinese state redefined “return” and “refugee” to serve shifting political objectives. While China is often perceived as a source, rather than a host, of asylum seekers, it hosted over 320,000 displaced migrants—primarily ethnic Chinese from Southeast Asia—during the Cold War. Through a systematic discourse analysis of 382 People’s Daily articles, we identify four state narratives—diaspora, diplomatic tool, ideological sanctuary, and legal duty—that structured how China labeled displaced migrants, interpreted their sentiments, and determined their settlement. These models evolved dynamically: from the 1950s to the late 1970s, China framed displaced migrants as both diasporic returnees and victims of foreign persecution to bolster its legitimacy. During the Cultural Revolution, they were recast as Maoist returnees seeking ideological redemption. By 1978, the state invoked international legal norms by portraying them as “refugees” to secure global assistance amid the Indochinese refugee crisis. We argue that China’s refugee discourse functioned as a flexible political instrument that unsettled rigid distinctions between voluntary and forced migration. Our findings advance a constructivist understanding of migration categories and offer a historically grounded critique of refugee politics beyond Western-centric Cold War narratives.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00468-6", "doi": "10.1186/s40878-025-00468-6", "journal_full": "Comparative Migration Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9892608024758082}, {"title": "Encampment policy and public perception: a cross-country analysis of host community responses to Rohingya refugees", "authors": "Minakshi Keeni, Nina Takashino", "abstract": "This study examines the influence of encampment policies on host community perceptions towards Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh and Nepal, with an emphasis on how these perceptions shape the future of the refugees. Bangladesh, which has implemented an encampment policy, contrasts with Nepal, where no such policy exists. The research employs ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis to evaluate host community attitudes towards government policies, citizenship for newborns, and access to essential services like healthcare, jobs, education, and social security. The findings reveal that in Bangladesh, wealthier community members perceive less economic competition from refugees, particularly in job markets, due to the restrictions imposed by the encampment policy. However, social media in Bangladesh exacerbates negative perceptions, particularly concerning citizenship for Rohingya newborns, potentially hindering social cohesion. In Nepal, the absence of an encampment policy correlates with more negative perceptions among younger and economically vulnerable groups, who view refugees as competitors for limited resources. The study concludes that while encampment policies may mitigate immediate economic tensions, they risk deepening social divisions. Conversely, the lack of such policies in Nepal may lead to heightened resource competition and social tension.

Although our primary focus is on asylum seekers, we find that high migration costs also affect decisions, suggesting a need to ‘recover’ investments through settlement in more stable or economically attractive countries.

We thus suggest that the commodification of migrant labor in the platform food delivery sector in Turin, while driven by platform logics, is rooted in, and compounded by, the contradictions and opacity of the Italian immigration regime. We thus advance the novel concept of algorithmic–bureaucratic precarization which allows an understanding of how the interaction of the legal and the digital causes migrant workers to be held on the outermost margins of employment. By drawing on ethnographic data collected during the Covid-19 pandemic, we chart the growing centrality of food delivery platforms in the political economy of migration. In so doing, we show how the interaction between shifting migration policies, information asymmetries of digital platforms and legal loopholes exacerbates the socio-economic vulnerability of migrant workers. We unpack algorithmic–bureaucratic precarization by describing the entanglement of legal and procedural failures that illegalize migrants and asylum seekers and put them at risk of exploitation.

Our results, from three‐level random slope logistic regression models on the probability of living within a 15 km radius, show that middle‐aged Italians are more likely to live near their parents and children than to their siblings, suggesting stronger family obligations in vertical ties compared to horizontal ties. There are substantial variations across Italian provinces, with Southern areas generally characterized by closer proximity to kin, particularly to siblings and parents, compared to Northern areas.

Drawing on National Register data, we use sequence analysis to describe the internal migration trajectories of asylum‐seeking migrants who arrived between 2012 and 2016. To assess the extent to which the place of reception allocated determines their subsequent moves, we compare them with migrants having similar sociodemographic profiles but who did not apply for asylum. Results show that asylum seekers are initially more dispersed across Belgium's territory compared to non‐asylum seekers and are overrepresented in rural areas and Wallonia. Their residential patterns later converge to those of non‐asylum seekers, with a concentration in urban Flanders and Brussels. Nonetheless, we find evidence that being assigned to a rural reception place at arrival slightly increases the chances of staying in rural municipalities. Additionally, being allocated to a reception place in one region significantly reduces the chances of moving to the opposite region.

However, inequality within communities of origin has received far less attention in the literature. This article addresses this gap by focusing on the determinants of international migration aspirations, challenging existing findings, and contributing to the expanding body of research on the inequality‐migration nexus. Leveraging a novel data set from 25 communities in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, this study makes four key contributions. First, we distinguish between perceived and objective measures of wealth and inequality, exploring how each is associated with international migration aspirations. Second, we identify the specific wealth groups most sensitive to inequality and examine how their migration aspirations vary according to both individual wealth levels and the broader context of community‐level inequality. Third, our multi‐level modelling approach enables a nuanced comparison of subjective and objective measures of wealth and inequality at both individual and community levels. Finally, our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in both perceived and observed wealth inequality within countries, underscoring the need for localized analyses that move beyond cross‐country comparisons to better understand how inequality shapes migration dynamics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70061", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70061", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9730283542003278}, {"title": "A unified framework integrating psychology and geography", "authors": "Friedrich M.

Existing theory suggests that when social reinforcement makes the adoption of behavior more likely, it should spread more—both farther and faster—on clustered networks with redundant ties. Conversely, if adoption does not benefit from social reinforcement, it should spread more on random networks which avoid such redundancies. We develop a model of behavior diffusion with tunable probabilistic adoption and social reinforcement parameters to systematically evaluate the conditions under which clustered networks spread behavior better than random networks. Using simulations and analytical methods, we identify precise boundaries in the parameter space where one network type outperforms the other or they perform equally. We find that, in most cases, random networks spread behavior as far or farther than clustered networks, even when social reinforcement increases adoption. Although we find that probabilistic, socially reinforced behaviors can spread farther on clustered networks in some cases, this is not the dominant pattern. Clustered networks are even less advantageous when individuals remain influential for longer after adopting, have more neighbors, or need more neighbors before social reinforcement takes effect. Under such conditions, clustering tends to help only when adoption is nearly deterministic, which is not representative of socially reinforced behaviors more generally. Clustered networks outperform random networks by a 5% margin in only 22% of the parameter space under its most favorable conditions.

The case demonstrates that public sector crisis management requires more than technical responses; it demands strategic awareness of legitimacy dynamics and strong leadership in network governance. Adopting a legitimacy‐as‐process perspective, the study provides novel conceptual and practical insights for improving public crisis governance.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/puar.70008", "doi": "10.1111/puar.70008", "journal_full": "Public Administration Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.6109765282293831}, {"title": "Police leadership at the political interface: A systematic literature review", "authors": "Jane Roberts, Jean Hartley", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/14719037.2025.2507945", "doi": "10.1080/14719037.2025.2507945", "journal_full": "Public Management Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012532104182295556}, {"title": "Policy implementation as social justice: a realist review of administrative burden research", "authors": "Jesse W.

Property law grants individual control over the resource, while consumer law protects consumers from exploitation but leaves them dependent on corporations for the continued use and management of the resource. This article examines the nature and scope of these protections by engaging with cases where there is a shift from a property protection to a consumer protection.

We identify four issues: mismeasurement of Jewish parentage, insufficient controls for social class, and two gaps in specifying and operationalizing cultural mechanisms. Re-analyzing the National Survey of Youth and Religion (NSYR), we show that HMLS’s findings remain stable after correcting Jewish parentage mismeasurement but shift substantially when better adjusting for social class. We argue that cultural explanations must meet two additional principles—portability and convertibility—to avoid lapsing into essentialism or reproducing “culture of poverty” narratives. These principles require that (a) social and cultural mechanisms function independently of group membership and be transferable across actors and fields, and (b) structural advantages and barriers are acknowledged and integrated.

This case is particularly interesting as the government has implemented a range of measures to encourage families to have more children, emphasising national identity and cultural preservation. Meanwhile, immigration – despite its potential to mitigate population decline – is portrayed not as a solution but a threat. While Western European populists invoke gender equality and LGBTQ+ rights to defend a “progressive” European identity under threat from Islam, their Central and Eastern European counterparts depict migration as a major threat to traditional family structures and heteronormative values rooted in Christian-nationalist ideals. To examine how these two policy domains intersect, we analysed 221 government speeches and articles published between 2014 and 2022. Using thematic analysis, we identified seven major topics. The predominant theme was that immigration cannot resolve demographic issues, instead advocating for policies that encourage Hungarian births. This central theme was supported by topics directly linked to it, such as the cultural threat of immigration and the will of the people, and by four subthemes less directly related, including sovereignty, labour market issues, deservingness, and security concerns. Our findings have broader implications for comparative research, shedding light on the dynamics of populist political systems and their influence on migration and family policy discourses.

Baseline results suggest that political stability has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on economic growth. However, the interaction between political stability and natural disasters is not consistently significant across all model specifications. Robustness checks, including corrections for autocorrelation, clustered standard errors, and the exclusion of extreme years, indicate that while the interaction effect may exist, it is sensitive to assumptions about time dependence and model specification.

This infrastructure supports the development of a significantly US-centric fund industry, facilitating substantial investments into US capital markets. Additionally, it serves as a global conduit, channelling funds from regions such as Asia and Latin America into US markets, streamlining the process by which foreign investors acquire US securities, and supporting the development of complex USD-denominated financial products. This dynamic enhances the depth, liquidity, and complexity of US capital markets, thereby reinforcing US centrality in global financial networks and bolstering its geopolitical power through financial diplomacy, economic sanctions, regulatory influence, and control over critical financial infrastructure. The relationship underscores the infrastructural power of the Cayman Islands, whose financial and legal framework is essential for sustaining and amplifying US centrality.

Respondents who heard the report were 8 percentage points more likely to reject all forms of early marriage and 5.4 percentage points more likely to say they would report early marriage to authorities. However, hearing the report did not influence perceptions of community norms or willingness to speak out against early marriage, and the persuasive effect of the report was attenuated when presented alongside a countervailing signal from Tanzania’s Attorney General.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qkj8m_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/qkj8m_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008344460738060389}, {"title": "Bordering on Discontent: The Political Consequences of Border Liberalization", "authors": "Jose Maycas-Sardi, Josep Serrano-Serrat", "abstract": "In the aftermath of globalization, Western democracies have witnessed a surge in political disaffection and radical-right support.

We argue that open borders enable brief, routine interactions between groups across historically closed frontiers. When this occurs between regions of unequal perceived status, it can erode symbolic boundaries and foster resentment. We examine this in the context of the German--Czech border, which transformed from a militarized Cold War frontier to an internal EU border. Leveraging two moments of liberalization---the fall of the Iron Curtain (1989) and Czech EU accession (2004)---we apply difference-in-differences and event study designs using municipality-level data from Bavaria.

This article traces the fate of devices funded by the EU’s 7th Framework Programme for managing human and non-human movements. Theoretically, it adds to the literature on ignorance by approaching debates on non-knowledge through a Bourdieusian analytical lens, and methodologically, it proposes to mobilise the concept of ‘symbolic violence’ to investigate and compare what is acknowledged and what is not, what is obscured or obfuscated in and through R&amp;D projects. Empirically, the paper examines several projects that aim to manage people and things on the move, and which have materialised in more or less overt ways. The article argues that projects focused on border security play a precursory role in the enactment of violent devices, and simultaneously obfuscate the non-knowledge of ‘violent ends’ that shape the future of the EU’s border governance.

Drawing on evolutionary biology and memetic theory (Dawkins, 1976; Boyd &amp; Richerson, 1985; Henrich, 2015), the study conceptualizes organizations as meme-based ecosystems where behaviors, values, and ideas undergo selection and replication. However, in many modern organizations, selection pressure has become distorted: anger, dominance, and procedural rigidity serve as negative filters that suppress memetic diversity and innovation. The analysis identifies three dominant types of suppressive forces—rage-dominant leaders, charismatic silencers, and empathy-deficient operators—each contributing to what we term \"memetic desertification\": a cultural environment in which novelty is punished and conformity is rewarded. These dynamics lead to cultural senescence, loss of adaptability, and increased turnover. To counteract this degenerative trend, the paper proposes structural interventions, including lateral promotion systems, anonymous feedback channels, and training for non-dominant leadership. Furthermore, it suggests the incorporation of AI-based evaluation systems to depersonalize feedback and detect systemic biases in meme selection and suppression.

The ability to combine paid work and family life gender-equally has been a longstanding policy aim in Sweden, which has sought to solve this problem by supporting dual-earner-dual-carer families. This study explores how low-resourced single mothers meet family needs in the Swedish context, using low-resourced coupled parents as a comparison group. Thirty-one single mothers and coupled parents (16 single mothers, 13 coupled mothers, 2 coupled fathers), recruited through community organisations in four Swedish cities, participated in seven focus groups during spring 2023. While Sweden is considered a frontrunner in the gender revolution, I suggest that the policy assumption of equally shared parenting disadvantages low-resourced single mothers. Swedish social policies are predicated on a perceived equal division of parenting, but there are rarely checks to ensure that parenting is actually carried out equally. When the actual division is highly unequal, low-resourced single mothers lack adequate support to meet family needs. Single mothers are set back both as a direct implication of the dual-earner-dual-carer model and in relative terms, through policies that either assume gender-equal parenting or that do not compensate for its absence. This leads to under-recognised financial, emotional, and practical vulnerabilities, particularly among single mothers experiencing a gendered lack of division of labour with their co-parent.

The presented study uses PCA and time-lagged regression on panel data to explore how forms of capital help older workers (N=15,527) to remain working across three successive periods. The results show that wider community social capital, alongside human, health and digital capital (domains of cultural capital), indeed help older adults to extend their working lives.

Emerging evidence suggests that adults with NF1 may experience higher rates of hopelessness and suicidal ideation compared to the general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the pooled prevalence of suicidal ideation in adults with NF1 and to identify key risk factors. Methods: We adhered to PRISMA guidelines to search MedLine, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and other electronic databases from January 1980 through September 2023 using keywords “neurofibromatosis type 1,” “NF1,” “suicide,” and “suicidal ideation.” After removing duplicates and screening titles/abstracts, 29 articles underwent full-text review; 3 studies (total N=220 NF1 patients; sample sizes 50–60 each) provided sufficient quantitative data for meta-analysis. Quality appraisal employed standardized checklists. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence. Multivariate logistic regression results from individual studies were synthesized narratively. Results: The pooled lifetime prevalence of suicidal ideation among adults with NF1 was 42% (95% CI: 19–65%), significantly exceeding matched control rates of approximately 10%. Key predictors identified across studies included higher pain severity (p&lt;0.01) and greater perceived disability (p&lt;0.01).

Yet divisions within Unionist ranks—exacerbated by British reluctance to enforce conscription—challenged long-standing assumptions of Protestant “loyalty” and Catholic “disloyalty.” At the same time, Nationalists framed conscription as an illegitimate imposition by a foreign state, underscoring their self-identification as Irish citizens under occupation. Perhaps paradoxically, by forgoing conscription, Britain gained a measure of legitimacy in Catholic eyes, encouraging some Nationalists to engage more constructively with British institutions and signaling new possibilities for political accommodation.

While traditional approaches have emphasized spiritual or social functions, emerging research suggests many religious prohibitions may encode practical survival wisdom developed over millennia. Objective: This study tests the hypothesis that religious practices systematically preserve survival-relevant knowledge across cultures through the Cultural Survival Framework, which proposes that religious systems function as sophisticated survival technologies transmitted through oral traditions. Methods: We conducted a systematic analysis of 151 religious practices from 74 cultures across six continents using a comprehensive 29-column coding framework. Each practice was classified across five survival domains (Food Safety &amp; Nutrition, Disease Prevention &amp; Health, Resource Conservation &amp; Management, Social Cooperation &amp; Stability, Environmental Adaptation) and assigned evidence levels (1-5 scale) based on documented survival benefits. Geographic distribution, cultural independence, and environmental factors were controlled to address potential confounding variables. Statistical analysis examined correlations between evidence quality and confidence assessments. Results: Religious practices demonstrated a strong positive correlation with survival benefits (r = 0.614, p &lt; 0.001). Evidence levels were significantly skewed toward moderate to strong survival benefits, with 73.5% of practices achieving Levels 3-5 evidence and 37.8% reaching definitive or strong evidence (Levels 4-5). Social Cooperation &amp; Stability represented the largest domain (41.7%), while Resource Conservation practices showed the highest average evidence levels. Geographic analysis revealed minimal spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.12, p = 0.23), indicating independent cultural evolution rather than diffusion from common sources. Conclusions: These findings provide compelling empirical support for the Cultural Survival Framework, demonstrating that religious prohibitions and practices systematically encode practical survival wisdom across diverse cultures. The strength and consistency of correlations suggest that survival pressures have shaped religious evolution, with practices providing genuine survival advantages being preferentially preserved and transmitted across generations.

Combining lexicometric and qualitative analysis, this research shows that TAPs are rarely central to evaluations, often overshadowed by publications and other conventional outputs. Where TAPs are addressed, reviewers express difficulties due to insufficient documentation, inconsistencies across sources, and uncertainty about originality or relevance. These issues reflect both procedural shortcomings and a lack of shared criteria.

Secondary data were sourced from official documents, working reports and newspaper editorials, which were collected from public libraries, while some documents of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) were sourced from NCAA and other online sources. Data were content analysed. Nigeria has made significant strides in improving aviation security through regulatory frameworks, strategic plans implementation, and international collaborations. Findings have however, revealed that issues such as inadequate technology, corruption, limited funding and insufficient training continue to pose significant barriers to its efforts towards exploring its full potential and contributing optimally to national security. Critical issues bothering on defective passenger profiling, obsolete surveillance technology and porous perimeter fencing systems were identified as major impediments that require appropriate attention through massive investment in biometric technology, intrusion detection devices with integrated alarm systems and surveillance drones equipped with real time footage access. Aviation security plays a critical role in the broader national security framework. However, its full potential can only be realised through government intervention in facilitating significant investment in airport infrastructure, innovative policy implementation, capacity building, and a more robust inter-agency coordination.

Roma identity may be endorsed by members of the community, or assigned by external observers, with no clear superiority of either definition. I used two waves of the unique Hungarian Youth Research (Magyar Ifjúság Kutatás) household survey (combined N=16015), which contains both self-reports and observer reports by surveyors about the Roma identity of participants, to 1) compare the size and overlap of the self-reported and observer-reported Roma community, and 2) assess with hypothesis-free, cross validated methods what characteristics are associated with self-reported and observer-reported Roma identity, and the mismatch of the two. I found that observers identified more respondents as Roma than self-reports, and both false negatives and false positives were common. Self-reports, observer-reports and false positives depend on similar variables, centered around large household size, financial deprivation, tolerance toward Roma, and limited adoption of digital technology. False negative observer reports (self-reported Roma considered non-Roma by surveyors) are predicted, however, mainly not by the absence of these characteristics, but by the adoption of cosmopolitan middle-class values such as tolerance towards foreigners, support for sustainable technologies and good health behavior. The results show that census reports about the Roma community are an underestimate of their public presence, either due to the ethnicization of poverty by external observers or identity concealment. Findings also indicate the presence of a large, well-assimilated Roma community who external observers fail to identify due to their non-stereotypical values and lifestyle.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fuv5k_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/fuv5k_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.638261984496511}, {"title": "Acercamiento bibliométrico a los estudios de género en España y Brasil. Feminismo y gestión del género", "authors": "María Aguilar-Soto, Pedro Lázaro-Rodríguez", "abstract": "Visibilizar el trabajo que se realiza en el campo de los estudios de género es una de las labores que ha de desarrollar el mundo académico para fortalecer dichos estudios. Este trabajo se enmarca dentro de la línea de la producción científica con perspectiva feminista utilizando técnicas bibliométricas para hacer patentes las líneas de investigación más productivas en el campo científico de los estudios de género a partir de documentos recuperados de la Web of Science de España y Brasil. Esta representación permite ver las fortalezas y debilidades en las que la agenda feminista trabaja en estos dos países y los aspectos más representados en la ciencia mainstream del feminismo. Se toman como guía las denominaciones de líneas de investigación de trabajos precedentes con el mismo objeto de estudio. Se pretende realizar una reflexión más amplia respecto al feminismo y la objetividad de la ciencia, la academia y la bibliometría, para aportar claves hacia una bibliometría feminista más allá de la “gestión del género”. En cuanto a resultados, se destaca que España presenta un abanico multidisciplinario desde las ciencias médicas y psicológicas a las ciencias sociales (deporte, educación, feminismo, comunicación, sociología, etc.), mientras que en Brasil la línea más productiva es la referida a estudios de género y diversidad. Un aspecto a destacar por su valor e interés es que los estudios de género y feminismo en Brasil se plantean mayoritariamente desde la perspectiva de la salud mostrando poca multidisciplinariedad. Por último, la reflexión llevada a cabo obliga a desgranar los problemas en la delimitación del campo científico, en la base de datos utilizada y en la posible falta de profundidad en el análisis descriptivo, que podrían llevar al estudio a un nivel simplista, como analizan algunas autoras feministas sobre trabajos bibliométricos de estudio de género y feminismo.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/grq2x_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/grq2x_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.20062205213787054}, {"title": "Widely used, barely trusted? Understanding student perceptions on the use of Generative AI tools in Higher Education", "authors": "Carmen Cabrera, Ruth Neville", "abstract": "With the increasing integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in everyday tasks, its potential to transform the learning experience has gained significant attention. However, concerns have been raised relating to the use of GAI as a threat to academic integrity, the lack of accuracy of its outputs, and its potential to hinder critical engagement in learning. While HE institutions globally have warned against the unregulated use of AI-generated content, the prevailing approach is to guide students in the ethical and transparent use of GAI tools. This research, based on primary data from a questionnaire involving undergraduate and postgraduate students across several UK HE institutions, aims to explore student perspectives on issues such as plagiarism, reliability of outputs, and the impact of GAI on the learning process; and how these perspectives vary across genders and domicile status (domestic vs. international students). Our findings show that students who identify as men report a higher frequency of GAI usage than women and that international students have more liberal standards regarding academic integrity compared to their UK counterparts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hxc4u_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/hxc4u_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0061819006718449865}, {"title": "News Media Coverage of Gun Violence: A Scoping Review", "authors": "Chad M. Topaz, Gina Jae, Jude Higdon", "abstract": "This scoping review synthesizes recently published research on news media coverage of gun violence in the United States. Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a systematic search of Web of Science and Google Scholar databases identified 76 peer-reviewed empirical studies published since 2000. Analysis reveals several recurring themes. First, news media coverage tends to be greater for incidents involving numerous victims, particularly women and/or children; occurring in schools, religious sites, or government buildings; or carried out by perpetrators who are young, ideologically driven, and/or show signs of severe mental illness. Second, race plays a significant role in shaping narrative frames, with media portrayals often depicting white individuals more sympathetically compared to racially minoritized individuals, regardless of whether they are victim or perpetrator. Third, media narratives display dynamic evolution over decades, transitioning from framing gun violence as isolated and episodic to addressing it as a part of broader social contexts and societal concerns. Finally, news coverage of gun violence is associated with negative audience emotions, especially fear, as well as with increased gun background checks suggestive of accelerated gun purchasing. Regarding media coverage's role in inciting further violence, however, studies present mixed findings. Limitations include the exclusion of social media discourse, which warrants study in future research. Future studies should also examine how news media coverage represents individuals across diverse gender identities, LGBTQIA+ communities, and disability statuses, while adopting intersectional perspectives. Three interrelated conclusions emerge from this analysis: the different types of gun violence that occur, the level of news media attention each receives, and the academic research that has investigated these media portrayals to date.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m984w_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/m984w_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007775260537396855}, {"title": "Analyzing the Discourse around Russo-Ukrainian war in Germany: Understanding Variances in Public Stances", "authors": "Kyoungin Baik, Jisu Kim", "abstract": "In contemporary conflicts, public opinion is shaped not only by traditional media and politics but also by digital interactions. The 2022 Russo-Ukrainian war intensified an ongoing crisis, drawing global attention and public engagement. Social media has played a key role in mediating these responses and revealing real-time public interpretation. This study explores the online discourse surrounding the Russo-Ukrainian war on X (formerly Twitter), examining how it shapes and reflects public discourse during the conflict. Focusing on Germany, it analyzes dominant narratives, sentiments, and stances expressed on the platform, while integrating socio-economic indicators—such as unemployment rates, the Social Connectedness Index, and regional demographics—to contextualize regional variations in public attitudes and social dynamics. We employ a Large Language Model for stance detection, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling. We then apply statistical modeling to examine how these public expressions relate to socio-economic conditions and emotional tone. This study shows that public attitudes toward the Russo-Ukrainian war are emotionally complex and evolving. Negative sentiment dominates, but positive engagement around inclusion also appears. Supportive stances are more common than opposition, with a clear shift toward greater support after February 24, while opposition is more cautious and tied to socio-economic contexts. The research provides insights into the intersection of digital narratives and offline realities, offering a nuanced perspective on public discourse and its role in shaping responses to complex international crises.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qe4m3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/qe4m3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0229848197953203}, {"title": "Hire Ed: Job Market Dynamics for Tenure-Track Faculty Positions in Archaeology", "authors": "Ben Marwick, Anne Marie Poole, Ailin Zhang, Setareh Shafizadeh, Jess Beck", "abstract": "Many archaeology graduate students pursue advanced degrees in the hope of undertaking an academic career. Job listing websites often serve as the first port-of-call for students seeking academic positions.

We investigated the editing dynamics of the Wiki to understand its users and their biases. We then analyzed the text of 431 job ads posted from 2013–2023. Our analysis addresses the question of how archaeological topics, methods, and geographic regions specified in archaeological job ads have shifted over time. We also explored whether the labor burden for applicants has changed over time: do institutions request more information and documents from applicants at the initial stages of application, compared to a decade ago? Finally, we assessed the influence of socio-political factors on the changing focus of research topics in the field. We conclude with implications for archaeology students, graduates, and advisors seeking to understand the dynamics of the academic job market and the requirements of employers.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/whkjs_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/whkjs_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.014816860368466855}]
