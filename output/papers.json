[{"title": "Claimability in International Relations: Oil Discoveries, Territorial Claims, and Interstate Conflicts", "authors": "KYOSUKE KIKUTA", "abstract": "Interstate conflict is rare not primarily because states settle disputes peacefully but largely because they have no serious dispute. To address this simple but oft-neglected reality, I provide a comprehensive measurement of states’ claimable areas. Focusing on three international norms that emerged after the world wars (territorial integrity, minority protection, and maritime sovereignty), I code geographical extents of states’ claimable areas for 1946–2024. I illustrate the usefulness of this dataset by applying it to oil and conflict. By leveraging the records of over 600,000 wildcat drills, natural experiments, and difference-in-differences, I demonstrate that fuel resources increased interstate conflicts only when discovered in areas claimable to multiple states. The extensive analyses of validity, heterogeneity, and mechanisms, as well as the “most-similar” case study, provide further evidence. These findings expand the emerging literature on territorial norms by providing comprehensive, rigorous, and contemporary evidence for claimability in international relations.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101366", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101366", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01689026268443905}, {"title": "The Social Origins of Effort: How Incentives Reduce Socioeconomic Disparities among Children", "authors": "Jonas Radl, William Foley, Lea Katharina Kröger, Patricia Lorente, Alberto Palacios-Abad, Heike Solga, Jan Stuhler, Madeline Swarr", "abstract": "Cognitive effort (i.e., the mobilization of mental resources for task performance) is essential to equality of opportunity and meritocracy because it epitomizes individual agency. However, sociological theories of social inequality in effort are scarce and partial, and available empirical measures of effort are unreliable and lack validity. We fill this lacuna by (1) elaborating a theoretical account of how socioeconomic status (SES) affects children’s cognitive effort, (2) developing a novel research design for measuring effort using simple-yet-demanding behavioral tasks and varying incentive conditions, and (3) presenting evidence based on this laboratory design featuring 1,360 5th-grade students. We theorize that greater material abundance and lower environmental threat reduce the subjective costs of exerting effort for higher-SES children, and that parental socialization emphasizing autonomy gives them more intrinsic motivation compared to lower-SES children. Conversely, we posit that the effort of lower-SES children is more susceptible to material and status rewards. Supporting our expectations, we find that social origin effects on effort are largest when incentives are absent, yet decrease notably when material incentives are introduced. Albeit surprisingly modest and malleable, social origin effects on effort challenge voluntaristic notions of individual agency. Crucially though, providing tangible performance rewards can significantly narrow socioeconomic disparities in effort.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251401933", "doi": "10.1177/00031224251401933", "journal_full": "American Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01152220432597073}, {"title": "Search Platforms: Big Data and Sponsored Positions", "authors": "Maarten C W Janssen, Thomas Jungbauer, Marcel Preuss, Cole Williams", "abstract": "We study a search platform ranking firms’ products across sponsored and organic positions, accounting for the incentives of both firms and consumers.

How difficult will this transition be for the population as a whole and different subsets of consumers? This paper investigates this question using a dynamic general equilibrium model that captures a key feature of energy consumption: the relative energy content in one’s consumption basket falls significantly as a function of one’s relative income. Thus, low-income consumers are expected to be hit harder by the higher energy prices that we anticipate over the next few decades. In the model, energy—a complementary input to capital and labour—can be produced either using fossil fuel or a “green” technology. We represent the EU policy in terms of a tax on fossil fuel and show that the European Commission’s Fit-for-55 package implies a 106.4% tax on the fossil-based technology. The output losses from this tax are substantial, and GDP is 6.3% lower in the new steady state. The burden falls primarily on the lowest-income agent who represents the first income quintile and is 47% more worse off than the highest-income agent representing the fifth quintile. The output losses can almost be cut in half if the economy achieves a simultaneous increase in energy efficiency as outlined in the Fit-for-55 package.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueag004", "doi": "10.1093/ej/ueag004", "journal_full": "Economic Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.027360024164357455}, {"title": "Income taxation across countries", "authors": "Xincheng Qiu, Nicoló Russo", "abstract": "This paper examines income tax systems in over thirty countries over the past forty years using microdata from the Luxembourg Income Study.

Drawing on policy analysis, party manifestos, and media sources, it traces Croatia's shift toward liberalised recruitment of third‐country nationals amidst labour shortages and demographic decline. At the same time, migration has become increasingly politicised, particularly during the 2024 national elections. The article introduces the concept of segmented migration governance to capture this dual logic: while policy frameworks have liberalised to meet market needs, institutional oversight remains weak, integration underdeveloped, and political narratives fragmented. Technocratic depoliticisation by the ruling centre‐right coexists with cultural threat narratives from far‐right actors, generating a stratified political field. By situating Croatia within broader debates on migration governance, populism, and post‐socialist transitions, the article highlights the need to better understand how labour migration regimes are shaped by institutional legacies, elite strategies, and regional political economies. The analysis concludes by recommending stronger oversight of recruitment agencies, enhanced labour protections, and more inclusive integration policies to ensure the long‐term sustainability and legitimacy of Croatia's migration model.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/imig.70131", "doi": "10.1111/imig.70131", "journal_full": "International Migration", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9912950090053649}, {"title": "Authoritarian Reforms and External Legitimacy", "authors": "Calvert W.

This research contributes by offering findings from an iterative series of original survey experiments conducted over nationally representative samples of US citizens. Study 1 tested the foundational hypothesis—that reforms build external legitimacy—by adopting a simple independent groups design. Studies 2 and 3 subjected that hypothesis to harder tests via conjoint designs, and also evaluated extension hypotheses about when and in what sense “legitimacy” is gained. Across studies, the results consistently demonstrate that reforms (of a variety of types) do generate external legitimacy, offering both positive benefits as well as shielding benefits in keeping with theoretical arguments.

Yet, a common premise in the behavioral and social sciences is that people are prosocial mainly toward their ingroup and not outgroups. So far, evidence for this premise comes mostly from studies in which people must choose between ingroup and outgroup prosociality, thereby precluding positive associations between the two types of prosociality. We study situations in which people make separate decisions regarding the ingroup and outgroup, allowing us to examine how ingroup and outgroup prosociality are related. Across six large-scale and cross-societal datasets spanning 743,402 individuals in 121 societies, we find a robust positive relationship between ingroup and outgroup prosociality. This relationship holds across societies, different group categorizations, and a diverse range of prosociality measures, including prisoner’s dilemmas, public good dilemmas, dictator games, and survey items on trust and tolerance. Although people are slightly more prosocial toward their ingroup than the outgroup, those who are prosocial toward the ingroup also tend to be prosocial toward the outgroup.

The prevailing narrative is that global rangelands, from grasslands to deserts, are being degraded by overgrazing due to overstocking. This perception arises from scientific literature, which contains an order of magnitude more studies on overstocking than on reductions in stocking rates. In contrast, over the past 25 y, regions representing almost half (42%) of global livestock have experienced reductions in stocking rates rather than the expected increases. We evaluated socioeconomic, technological, and climatic direct drivers, as well as indirect drivers, of global stocking patterns. Trade and climate had no detectable effects, whereas technological shifts and meat consumption had an impact on stocking rates. Direct drivers were largely controlled by human population and gross domestic product. Wealthier regions, with slower population growth, greater feed supplementation, and reliance on nongrazing livestock, reduced stocking rates. Less affluent regions, facing rapid population growth and rising meat demand but limited technological and feed resources, increased stocking rates. The overlooked reductions in stocking rates may have major ecological consequences at regional and global scales. Destocking can impact biodiversity, fire regimes, potentially increase carbon sequestration, and modify land–atmosphere fluxes. These effects are not simply the reverse of overstocking, as some consequences are irreversible, including state transitions and local extinctions. The skewed pattern of publications toward overstocking and overgrazing led to a perception of widespread degradation and had consequences on research direction and policy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2509097122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2509097122", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.017383558848432235}, {"title": "Explaining supernatural cures for poorly understood illnesses: Revisiting classic questions with new evidence", "authors": "H.

We highlight low-cost measures that noncommercial researchers can take now to improve transparency and reusability.

Resilience outcomes are also highlighted—continuous service delivery, enhanced public policy value, and strengthened institutional identity. A key epiphany emerges: Resilience is not merely about responding to crises but also about embedding strategic principles into long‐term governance—balancing top‐down authority with decentralized decision‐making to functionally and structurally address short‐term needs and long‐term transformation.

Although public perceptions associate somewhat with elite ideology, more variation is attributable to how citizen-level partisans identify ideologically. This carries mixed implications. On one hand, partisan-ideological sorting in the electorate has made it easier for voters to see the difference between parties. On the other, it leads voters to see the parties as being more extreme than they would otherwise.

We carried out a cluster-randomized field experiment involving over 3,300 households across 121 multiethnic villages in Bangladesh. We find that a documentary film, designed to humanize the ethnic minority Santals and evoke empathy among the ethnic majority Bengalis, increased the ethnic majority’s prosociality toward minorities, though the strength of the evidence varies by treatment arm and outcome. Using emotion-detecting software to analyze facial expressions during the film viewing suggests that the documentary elicited emotional responses consistent with empathy. We do not find evidence that the intervention reduced the prevalence of negative stereotypes and discriminatory opinions toward minorities. In villages assigned to target network-central individuals, we find positive behavioral effects on untreated individuals, including Santals, and village-level administrative data suggest a reduction in police complaints in those villages. About five months after the intervention, we conducted a casual work field experiment involving 720 participants from the main intervention. In this task, pairs of ethnic majority and minority participants jointly produced paper bags for a local supplier under a piece-rate compensation scheme. We find positive treatment effects on productivity for both ethnic groups, with effects concentrated in villages where network-central individuals were treated. For the ethnic majority, increased prosociality, and for the ethnic minority, reciprocity or peer pressure may have contributed to increased productivity.

Higher growth experiences are also associated with improved perceptions of government performance and living standards. We find no similar channel between growth experience and interpersonal trust. Second, more recent growth experiences appear to matter most for trust in government, with no detectable effect of growth experienced during one’s formative years, closer to birth or before birth.

Using data on executive board members of all non-financial firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange from 1993 to 2016, we show that “lifetimers”—employees who spend their entire careers with a single company—continue to enjoy substantial advantages in CEO succession. They maintain their dominance by promoting fellow lifetimers and constraining the prospects of other candidates. At the same time, “external appointees”—organizational outsiders who join the firm directly as executive board members—also benefit from their institutional ties and boundary-spanning roles. Yet, unlike lifetimers, their relative advantages are fragile, as they lack durable intra-firm power bases and are more exposed to shifting external conditions and internal politics.

This is achieved by examining sector level resilience of ordinary volunteering during crises, possible spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering, and the persistence of individual crisis volunteers across the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020–2022 and the reception of Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s invasion in 2022. Using cross-sectional data from random samples of Danish adults before (n2020 = 3,519), during (n2021 = 1,700) and after (n2024 = 1,548) the pandemic, the results show that ordinary volunteering was highly resilient to the pandemic despite a significant reduction during the crisis. A five-round panel (n = 694) further shows that, while ordinary volunteering prior to the crisis correlated with crisis volunteering, crisis volunteering did not spill over into ordinary volunteering after the pandemic. Rather, crisis volunteers persisted engaging in crisis volunteering when Ukrainian refugees arrived. These findings have important implications for civil society studies because the absence of spill-over between ordinary and crisis volunteering suggests that the two types of volunteering operate according to distinct logics and the persistence of crisis volunteers across crisis challenges notions of crisis volunteering being spontaneous and emergent.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf219", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf219", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.42125269897811357}, {"title": "Does stringent climate policy decouple economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions?", "authors": "Ryan P Thombs, Andrew K Jorgenson", "abstract": "A foundational question in environmental sociology is whether economic growth can be sufficiently decoupled from greenhouse gas emissions. Scholars working in different analytical perspectives assert that such a decoupling is largely contingent on more stringent climate policy that mandates or incentivizes the reduction of carbon-intensive production. However, there is limited research on whether policy has such a moderating influence. Here, we extend the literature by testing whether more stringent climate policy moderates the effect of economic growth on greenhouse gas emissions using panel data from 1990 to 2022 for forty-nine countries. Building on the extended two-way fixed effects estimator, we advance an approach for estimating country-specific and average short-run and long-run effects with dynamic models that we show outperform other macro panel estimators using Monte Carlo experiments. Using this approach, we find that, on average, strong climate policy stringency decouples economic growth from emissions in the short run and the long run and that the decoupling effect is largest in higher-income nations. However, we also find that greater policy stringency is associated with increases in emissions in lower-income and middle-income nations. We then build a hypothetical three-nation World that consists of a lower-income, middle-income, and higher-income nation and develop a suite of scenarios that differ based on their rate of economic growth and climate policy stringency. The results suggest that steady-state and degrowth scenarios offer the most sustainable futures in terms of lower emissions and that degrowth is the most equitable in terms of reducing emissions. We conclude by arguing that these findings have significant implications for policymaking and for key theoretical debates in sociology regarding economic growth and the environment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf217", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf217", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008725318502213697}, {"title": "Navigating white space: how Black and Latine youth deepen their understanding of race and space through community-based education and youth workers as spatial guides", "authors": "Bianca J Baldridge, Marlo A Reeves", "abstract": "Guided by theories of racial capitalism, “white space,” and “bodies out of place” as frameworks, and through combined analyses of two studies in the same city with shared participants, the authors argue that Black and Latine youth possess a spatial awareness of white space.

This study's point of departure is that migrants’ high levels of loneliness may, in part, also reflect what could be called a “lonely migrant effect,” that is, selection of lonely people into international migration. Selection of this kind was assessed using the 2012 and 2016 rounds of the Dutch Public Health Monitor (n = 685,088), enriched with administrative data on emigration in the three years following survey data collection. Overall, 2,401 respondents emigrated from the Netherlands in this period. Emigration was regressed on respondents’ baseline loneliness scores in logistic regression models adjusted for various potential confounders.

If it is not ignored entirely, it tends to be aligned with either political elitism or political quietism. On the one hand, asceticism is often considered a special privilege of the aristocracy, which alone has the leisure to turn away from worldly affairs and cultivate the self as an aesthetic object, and thus to reproduce its dominant position in a social hierarchy that it has a strong interest in maintaining. On the other hand, theorists from Hegel to Arendt and beyond have dismissed asceticism and practices of self-transformation as a mere retreat from politics into the “inner citadel.” This article seeks to excavate and theorize a counter-tradition of political asceticism in order to demonstrate that practices of the self are not the property of the elite and indeed have been the conditions of possibility for anticolonial and anti-racist resistance struggles in highly diverse contexts. With comparative attention paid especially to MK Gandhi and Frederick Douglass, we argue that traditional dismissals of asceticism in political theory have missed (a) the extent to which the “inner citadel” is often the prime location for struggle left to the colonized; (b) how this inner citadel is weaponized in endeavors to train oneself into capacities of political agency; and (c) how this training-into-agency—which we call liberation asceticism —is not merely an individual but a truly collective practice.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917251398786", "doi": "10.1177/00905917251398786", "journal_full": "Political Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00889630858026702}, {"title": "The State as a Clearing House: Interest Organizations, the Common Good, and the Arduous Rise of Pluralist Democracy in Postwar Germany", "authors": "Timo Pankakoski", "abstract": "This article retells the German intellectual history of political pluralism from a novel perspective: that of the state as a clearing house. In regular business transactions, clearing houses settle debts and mediate between buyers and sellers, bearing risks on both parties’ behalf for a fee. In politics, the clearing house image describes political pluralism, interest groups, and the common good metaphorically—and, in Germany, pejoratively at first. The clearing house topos emerged in Carl Schmitt’s interwar criticism of pluralism, parliamentarianism, and the League of Nations. Alongside Otto Kirchheimer, particularly the post-1945 Schmittian antipluralists Werner Weber and Winfried Martini adopted the term to criticize the “occupation” of the state by private interests. However, the clearing house metaphor was also reappropriated by defenders of the republic like Dolf Sternberger, Ernst Friesenhahn, Horst Ehmke, Günter Dürig, Ernst Fraenkel, and Otto Stammer. In their creative reinterpretations, the state as a mediator between rival interests and viewpoints became a moderately positive image—one not only compatible with the common good but, in fact, serving it. The analysis reminds us that the economic framing of pluralistic interests by no means automatically excludes considerations of the common good. Correspondingly, “clearing house” gradually turned from a word of abuse into an affirmative metaphor with prodemocratic pluralistic implications, thus capturing, in a microcosmic fashion, much of Germany’s postwar democratization. This was a collective process, and the discursive continuities with prewar antipluralism highlight how pluralist democracy lives off the linguistic resources at its disposal, occasionally by creative reinterpretation", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00905917251412884", "doi": "10.1177/00905917251412884", "journal_full": "Political Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008321163166008394}, {"title": "Infertility and Unrealized Ideal Family Size", "authors": "Ester Lazzari, Eva Beaujouan", "abstract": "Research indicates that people often end their childbearing years with fewer children than they had expected in young adulthood.

Although these entities do not have specific environmental mandates, their varying degrees of discretion, autonomy, and capacity enabled them to resist antidemocratic measures targeting environmental policies while fragmenting authoritarian presidential power. By examining how the combination of these three elements influenced the levels of resistance to democratic backsliding in Brazil, our findings illuminate both the challenges and promises of polycentric governance systems in promoting democratic deliberation in policy‐making within democracies under threat.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/psj.70101", "doi": "10.1111/psj.70101", "journal_full": "Policy Studies Journal", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008568937583016911}, {"title": "The Epistemic Impact of Large Language Models on Policymaking", "authors": "Naikang Feng, Yanto Chandra", "abstract": "Knowledge is central to policy sciences and for good policymaking.

We use the concept of relational loyalty and argue that it plays a role in shaping citizens’ emigration decision-making. Drawing on a survey of pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong, we find that individuals who perceive themselves as more committed to liberal democratic values than the average citizen are more likely to have formulated concrete emigration plans. However, this perceived value disparity has limited predictive power in determining mere emigration intentions or actual emigration. These results demonstrate that while divergences in political values can influence politically-motivated emigration, their impact varies across different stages of the emigration decision-making process.

By contrast, the same body of research has ignored the experience of persons who exited home because of compulsion but arrived in the United States as self-settlers, a population consisting of persons granted asylum (the legal equivalent of refugee) and the still larger number of de facto refugees, whose quest for asylum has been denied.

We distinguish between immobility, return migration, and onward migration aspirations, and explore underlying mechanisms such as socioeconomic status, transnational ties, multilingualism, experiences of discrimination, and identification with the country of residence. Using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 , we find that individuals with a more recent immigrant descent tend to express higher return migration aspirations but lower onward migration aspirations. Direct migration experiences in childhood are associated with greater openness toward migration overall, though differently by descent: among those with a distant immigrant background, childhood migration fosters openness to onward migration, while it increases return aspirations among those with a more recent immigrant descent.

Thus, we still do not know if such implicit yet ubiquitous reminders of national identity, rather than those that explicitly invoke national pride, are able to reduce affective polarization. In order to fill this research gap, we conducted a survey experiment in Sweden and Denmark in 2023/2024, two countries where national flags are omnipresent yet often ‘unwaved’. Using two versions of subtle flag treatments, our results show that in Sweden, subjects who were primed with a picture of the national flag showed lower levels of affective polarization measured as social distancing, but not in terms of trait stereotyping or party dislike.

However, the secularisation of Western societies has changed its role. Secularisation not only limits the political relevance of religion, it may also affect the nature of religious cleavages themselves. While extant literature suggests that differences between religious denominations are in decline, with regard to differences between religious and non-religious voters there are two divergent expectations, (1) that these differences are also in decline and (2) that there is an increased polarisation between the religious and the non-religious. For the latter expectation, evidence has already been found regarding the United States. In this paper, we examine whether a similar change can be observed in Western Europe. Combining data from the European Social Survey (ESS) and information on parties’ positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES), we assess the nature of over-time changes in the connection between religion and the vote choice. The results point to an increased polarisation between members of a Christian church and the non-religious, however, we also find that non-Christians are more similar to the non-religious than to Christians.

Because political challenges stall climate progress, climate policy must address these political concerns. Second, governance innovations cannot be expected to deliver a perfect solution devised by a technocratic elite. Policy progress is uneven, slow, and incremental.

While prior research suggests that citizens generally disapprove of this tactic, this study re-evaluates how contextual factors shape these reactions, focusing specifically on cases of public service failure. In many areas of public management, service delivery is delegated or contracted out to public or private organizations, raising the question of whether such institutional arrangements make it easier for politicians to shift blame onto these agents. A survey experiment (n = 955) was conducted in the United Kingdom involving a hypothetical public service failure. Information cues varied the response strategy of local elected officials (shifting blame or accepting responsibility) and the service delivery model (public or private sector; high or low delegation). The results from OLS regression analyses show that participants were generally less approving of blame shifting compared to accepting responsibility. However, approval increased when the organization being blamed was viewed by participants as carrying more blame for failures in service delivery than the official. Although delegation levels did not directly moderate the effect of blame shifting, further logistic regression analysis shows that higher delegation made participants more likely to view the service provider as culpable, which in turn influenced how they reacted to blame shifting tactics. These findings highlight the conditional nature of public reactions to blame avoidance behavior, showing that citizens’ evaluations of tactics like blame shifting depend on their beliefs about who is responsible, which can be shaped by institutional context.

I theorize that justices deviate from this norm to signal their intense displeasure with a ruling in a way that is more salient for non-legal audiences. I expect that dissent-majority ideological distance, the overturning of precedent, and specific areas of law increase the likelihood of non-respectful dissents.

This study investigates how candidates adapted their issue emphasis strategies in response to this crisis and whether their adjustments aligned with voter issue salience. Using a combination of media content analysis (PolDem dataset) and public opinion survey data (Enquête Electorale Française – EnEF), the study systematically examines issue emphasis for the six major candidates. The findings show that while candidates initially engaged with the Ukraine crisis, their emphasis on the issue declined over time, as economic concerns dominated the campaign agenda. The analyses confirm that mainstream candidates followed public issue salience more closely than challenger candidates, who engaged in selective issue emphasis strategies. Notably, Marine Le Pen, often classified as a challenger, behaved as a mainstream candidate, prioritizing economic issues over her traditionally owned themes such as immigration. These findings contribute to broader debates on issue salience, electoral shocks, and strategic campaign behavior, demonstrating that while external crises can momentarily disrupt campaign agendas, they do not necessarily redefine electoral competition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/13540688261415758", "doi": "10.1177/13540688261415758", "journal_full": "Party Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01470174936052615}, {"title": "The business of climate change: changing sources of green capital accumulation in the coffee sector", "authors": "Janina Grabs, Stefano Ponte, Marc Castellón Durán", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2026.2614691", "doi": "10.1080/13563467.2026.2614691", "journal_full": "New Political Economy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.09689008489157813}, {"title": "How to abolish the abstract power of capital?", "authors": "Demet Şahende Dinler", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2025.2553688", "doi": "10.1080/13563467.2025.2553688", "journal_full": "New Political Economy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01169583700469734}, {"title": "Divergent paths of political trust in Southern Europe: the roles of economic performance, corruption, congruence, and polarisation", "authors": "Pablo Christmann, Pedro C.

Challenging the conventional dichotomy between crisis definition and crisis management, the article argues that crises inherently involve discursive and political acts through which governments experience and respond to delegitimization. Drawing on the sociology of trials (épreuves) and discourse analysis, it identifies three distinct forms of crisis government—governing during crisis, governing the crisis, and governing by crisis—and examines their emergence through an empirical analysis of the French government’s management of the subprime crisis (2007–2009). Each mode corresponds to a specific form of delegitimization trials: epistemic, policymaking, or political, and to a distinct strategy of re-legitimation. By analyzing three key events, the study reveals how policymakers discursively redefine crises to legitimize various governmental strategies, ranging from inaction and targeted emergency interventions to long-term structural reform.

The analysis shows how SD leveraged platform functionalities to balance textual and visual features, repost content, and incorporate hyperlinks on Facebook and X. Using these features, the party posted text-laden, argumentative and seemingly informative posts, which are likely to appeal not only to the customary format of content on the platforms but also to its respective audiences. Yet, although SD had larger followings and much more well-established accounts on both Facebook and X, the party posted the majority of its campaign material on TikTok, primarily in the form of memes.

Three mechanisms drive this process: (1) the alignment of interests around solving governance challenges; (2) constructive regulatory entrepreneurship, whereby the firm enhances state regulation while expanding its own influence; and (3) the mutual reinforcement of infrastructural power, as digital infrastructures serve as instruments of both governance and accumulation.

Using NielsenIQ Consumer Panel data, we find that the passage of RML led to an increase in the number of grocery store trips that involved “junk food,” as well as the amount of spending. This effect is particularly driven by an increase in ice cream, chips, and candy. Using the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), we find that the passage of RML also led to a decrease in exercise, particularly driven by a reduction in cardio, and suggestive evidence of more time spent at home.

These funding models lead to different accountability dilemmas: member capture and donor capture.

In this study, using internal migration data from 2008 to 2023, the structure of interregional migration flows and internal migration trends in Türkiye during the COVID‐19 pandemic were evaluated. The migration movements of the regions before and during the pandemic were analyzed using crude migration, migration effectiveness, and net migration methods to examine changes in interregional migration flows. In addition, the Bayesian ARIMA model was used to estimate short‐ and medium‐term transformations in internal migration flows following the pandemic. This method was used to project internal migration flows at the regional level up to 2035. The analyses revealed a general decrease in migration intensity across all regions during the pandemic period. Furthermore, migration intensified significantly from metropolitan areas to smaller settlements and rural areas during the pandemic. The forecast model developed in the study predicts a decline in net migration rates in regions such as Istanbul in the coming years. In contrast, regions such as the Mediterranean, Aegean, and Western Anatolia are expected to receive more migration in the future. The study concluded that although the migration pull factor of metropolitan cities will weaken, they will retain this characteristic. Conversely, regions that have consistently experienced negative migration from the past to the present will continue to exhibit this characteristic in the coming period. The study's findings indicate that the impact of the reverse migration pattern observed during the COVID‐19 pandemic on internal migration flows was short‐lived. In this regard, the study has the potential to contribute to the planning of migration management policies, particularly by providing forecasts of migration flows and internal migration burdens at the regional level in the short and medium term.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70186", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70186", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9734921139599534}, {"title": "Place Matters to Life After Return: Investigating Second‐Generation ‘Return’ to Different Locations in Turkey", "authors": "Nilay Kılınç, Russell King", "abstract": "Turkish migration to Germany has been the largest‐scale labour migration in postwar Europe, yet scant attention has been paid to the return flow to Turkey, and even less to the second generation's ‘return’. This paper rectifies this oversight and focuses specifically on the role of place in shaping the post‐return experiences of the second generation relocating to their parents' homeland. Based on narrative interviews with 71 returnees, we find that different outcomes await those relocating to the megalopolis of Istanbul, the tourist hub of Antalya, and a range of provincial towns. Istanbul offers the widest spectrum of job opportunities, especially to those with higher‐level qualifications. Antalya is attractive to returnees with low qualifications who are easily able to find work in the tourist economy and enjoy an ‘alternative’ lifestyle. Those who move to the provincial locations in northern, central and eastern Turkey are following family migration networks but face more difficulties accessing the labour market and adapting to a more ‘traditional’ society. Return outcomes are influenced by the positionalities of returnees, where the interplay of gender, class and social location in specific places shapes diverse return experiences.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70188", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70188", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9323457675437754}, {"title": "Same Country, Different Journeys: Ukrainian Voluntary Versus Forced Migrants in Poland", "authors": "Sabina Kubiciel‐Lodzińska, Arkadiusz Gardecki, Bogdan Ruszczak, Jolanta Maj", "abstract": "Poland has emerged as one of the primary destinations for Ukrainian refugees, with ~953,000 forced migrants from Ukraine residing in the country as of May 2024. This paper examines the differences in labour market integration between Ukrainian voluntary migrants and forced migrants in Poland, comparing their situations from 2022 to 2024. The analysis is based on three quantitative surveys conducted in 2022, 2023 and 2024. The article compares the situation of both groups of migrants in several aspects: labour market situation, job satisfaction, knowledge of spoken Polish and migrants' residence plans. Our research revealed that the differences between the two groups evolved throughout the study period. Among the surveyed group of Ukrainian refugees, the proportion of those entering employment has increased significantly, reaching 64% in 2024. In the same year, the employment rate among pre‐war migrants was higher, at 75.7%. The survey shows that the knowledge of the Polish language among refugees has improved over the analysed period. In the first edition of the survey, more than 20% of respondents did not speak Polish, whereas in 2024, this number had decreased to 3.2%. Our research contributes to human capital theory by emphasising that the realisation of migrants' potential—how effectively they utilise and develop their skills, education and experiences in their new country—depends not only on their qualifications but also nature of migration and shows the contrast between voluntary and forced migrants from the same country.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70197", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70197", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9954058507294093}, {"title": "The Making of Semi‐Regularity Among Migrants in Türkiye: Impacts of Work Permit Policies", "authors": "F.

Drawing on the literature on critical migration studies, it argues that work permit procedures in Türkiye position migrants within a legal category that can be described as semi‐regular. In this study, semi‐regularity refers to the legal status of migrants who possess the right to reside legally (e.g., through a residence permit or temporary protection status) but participate in the labour market without a work permit. Migrants experience this semi‐regular status differently in the labour market depending on their country of origin. Furthermore, unlike irregular migrants, those with semi‐regular status have access to some services, but in contrast to fully regular migrants, their access to services remains only partial. Research to date has largely focused on migrants in the Global North and this study broadens the literature on migrants' legal status by providing an example from Türkiye, a country of the Global South.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70196", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70196", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9946911187294194}, {"title": "Globalizing International Relations from within: discovering globality in Chineseness in Chinese International Relations theory", "authors": "Chengxin Pan, Nahui Chen", "abstract": "A central concept in Global International Relations (IR) is ‘global’ or ‘globality,’ which has been commonly understood as the sum total of all geo-cultural parts of the world. This understanding underpins Global IR’s efforts to make IR more geo-epistemologically representative and inclusive, but it has been criticized for its essentialism trap and geo-epistemology. While many critics problematize Global IR’s conception of globality, few pay attention to an alternative form of existence of globality, namely, its embodiment within each of the ‘geo-cultural’ parts. This article aims to engage with this form of globality by drawing on the conceptual framework of quantum holography, which sees the whole as not just comprising its parts but also being encoded within them. The implications are that if global-local relationality is holographic in nature, globalizing IR should entail not only externally expanding IR’s geo-epistemological horizon but also discovering and appreciating the globality that always already exists within each locale. Thus, this approach may help us tackle the stubborn binary of global vs. local/national in the Global IR debate and mitigate its essentialism trap and geo-epistemology. To illustrate, we apply this framework to problematize ‘Chineseness’ in the Chinese School of IR theory.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s175297192510016x", "doi": "10.1017/s175297192510016x", "journal_full": "International Theory", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.022071646903466302}, {"title": "Enduring impacts of El Niño on life expectancy in past and future climates", "authors": "Yanbin Xu, Wenjun Zhu, Dhrubajyoti Samanta, Benjamin P.

We estimate life expectancy losses of 0.5 years (monetary equivalent loss of US$2.6 trillion) for the 1982–1983 El Niño and 0.4 years (US$4.7 trillion) for the 1997–1998 event. Climate projections under moderate emissions pathways suggest a cumulative decline of 2.8 years in life expectancy by 2100, amounting to US$35 trillion losses, with most of the monetary burden falling on the middle-aged population.

To examine how partisanship takes root around novel policy issues, we perform a mixed‐methods study, analyzing survey data from 129 state legislators in 44 states and performing four case studies featuring legislative debates over enacted AI regulation in Idaho, Colorado, and Illinois. We articulate four potential partisan triggers that shape the emergence of issue polarization: (1) competing problem definitions, (2) preferred policy tools, (3) stakeholder participation, and (4) issue placement in policy subsystems, and we introduce the concept of subsystem shopping. Flexibility and compromise in subnational AI policymaking were initially common due to uncertain issue ownership over diverse problem definitions, the presence of disrupted industries, and deference to nonpartisan expert voices, which enabled subsystem shopping towards less controversial policymaking. However, bipartisan windows narrowed as AI became anchored in party‐owned domains, lobbying became more coordinated, and “soft” areas of initial legislative consensus hardened into disputes over more robust policy tools. These developments offer insights into how nascent policy domains can initially sustain bipartisan cooperation, and why it may erode unless actors work to preserve it.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.70020", "doi": "10.1002/poi3.70020", "journal_full": "Policy and Internet", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005304053354617921}, {"title": "Issue Information", "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.70024", "doi": "10.1002/poi3.70024", "journal_full": "Policy and Internet", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.002721892665732639}, {"title": null, "authors": null, "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/poi3.v18.1", "doi": "10.1002/poi3.v18.1", "journal_full": "Policy and Internet", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0036221616017129143}, {"title": "Feedback-induced attitudinal changes in risk preferences", "authors": "Antonios Nasioulas, Elise Potier, Fabien Cerrotti, Maël Lebreton, Stefano Palminteri", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67729-x", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-025-67729-x", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01139736503868094}, {"title": "The urgent need for African research collaboration on medicine quality", "authors": "Fanqi Zeng, Simon Mariwah, Gerry Mshana, Daniel Amoako-Sakyi, Heather Hamill", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-67430-z", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-025-67430-z", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08883578898824218}, {"title": "Symmetry in category systems across languages", "authors": "Charles Kemp", "abstract": "Language reflects how people organize experience into categories, and cross-linguistic comparison can help to identify general principles that shape categorization.

In all countries, citizens strongly endorse Ukraine’s sovereignty and self-determination while weighing human suffering and conflict escalation risk, but less so economic costs.

I further find that party leaders even influence the members who did not support their leadership bid, and rank-and-file members are less likely to cast partisan votes when there is no party leader. This study also sheds light on a historically anomalous period of Republican moderation, and it helps to explain the increase in congressional polarization over the past 50 years.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10071", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10071", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0052100358021213156}, {"title": "When can individual partisanship be tempered?

Using new individual-level panel data on the COVID-19 pandemic from 54,216 US adults between March 2020 and September 2021, we consider how partisan differences vary according to the personal costs and benefits of behaviors, their public symbolism, and elite-level policy choices. Employing various panel data estimators, including difference-in-differences, we evaluate how partisan gaps evolve across changes to the political and health contexts, including the national vaccine rollout, individual vaccination status, and within-state policy variation. We find partisan divides are substantial even in (ostensibly) apolitical domains, although they are tempered by higher net personal costs to actions, lower public symbolism, and elite policy choices that counter national party cues.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10067", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10067", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007990189586997598}, {"title": "A Bayesian mixture model captures temporal and spatial structure of voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data", "authors": "John O’Brien", "abstract": "The estimation of voting blocs is an important statistical inquiry in political science. However, the scope of these analyses is usually restricted to roll call data where individual votes are directly observed. Here, we examine a Bayesian mixture model with Dirichlet-multinomial components to infer voting blocs within longitudinal referendum data. This model infers voting bloc mixture within municipalities using state-level data aggregated at the municipal level. As a case study, we analyze the vote totals of Maine referendum questions balloted from 2008 to 2019 for 423 municipalities. Using a birth–death Markov chain Monte Carlo approach to inference, we recover the posterior distribution on the number of voting blocs, the support for each question within each bloc, and the blocs’ mixture within each municipality. We find that these voting blocs are structured by geography and largely consistent across the study period. The model finds that blocs exhibit both spatial gradients and discontinuities in their structure. Examining the statistical fit of the model, we uncover a small number of questions that show inconsistency with the statewide bloc structure and note that the content of these questions relates to specific regions. We conclude with possible statistical extensions, connections to other statistical frameworks in political science, and detail possible locations for model applications.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10050", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10050", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013401678188700972}, {"title": "Community-based nearshore wave and water level monitoring in Nunavut, Arctic Canada 2021–2023", "authors": "David Didier, Faten Zouaghi, Stéphanie Coulombe, Terry Noah, Erin Marie Bertrand, Jacob Stolle, Charles Jourdain-Bonneau, Jeremy Baudry, Samuel Binette, Paul Nicot, Richard Akana, Béatrice Noël, Antoine Boisson, Denys Dubuc, Bay Berry, Gabriel Ferland, Ludivine Lafosse, Olorunfemi Omonigbehin, Charlotte Stancu, Carole-Anne Guay, Hatim Ben Said, Patrick White, Ana Heras Duran, Laisa Audlaluk Watsko, Jimmy Qaapik, Daniela Marianne Regina Walch, Danielle Hallé, Claire Parrott, Jenifer Spence, Andrew Kent Hamilton, Yohan Quénet, Samuel Gagnon, Simon Bélanger, Frédéric Bouchard, Barret Kurylyk, Gwénaëlle Chaillou, Dany Dumont, Paul Myers, Jordan Eamer, Alexandre Normandeau, Maya Bhatia", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06559-y", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06559-y", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.09078313874762556}, {"title": "An electronic product carbon footprint dataset for question answering", "authors": "Kaiwen Zhao, Ajesh Koyatan Chathoth, Bharathan Balaji, Stephen Lee", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06544-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06544-5", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007560898609032085}, {"title": "Organ retrieval and collection of health information for donation: The ORCHID dataset", "authors": "Hammaad Adam, Tom Pollard, Vinith Suriyakumar, Benjamin Moody, Jan Niklas Adams, Jennifer Erickson, Greg Segal, Matthew Wadsworth, Ashia Wilson, Marzyeh Ghassemi", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-06435-1", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-025-06435-1", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03867788291433105}, {"title": "Labeled Datasets for Air Handling Units Operating in Faulted and Fault-free States", "authors": "Naghmeh Ghalamsiah, Jin Wen, Guowen Li, Yimin Chen, Xing Lu, Yangyang Fu, Mengyuan Chu, Zheng O’Neill", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-06179-y", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-025-06179-y", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005236308930363642}, {"title": "Clinical and dosimetric dataset of time-to-event normal tissue complication probability for osteoradionecrosis", "authors": "Natalie A.

Using a new data collection effort, I show that subjects who are more Agreeable or Neurotic have systematically different propensities to complete surveys.

Moving beyond pairwise frame comparisons, we adopt a policy learning approach that identifies the most effective frame using cross-validated sample splitting, thereby avoiding selective inference. We find that the economic efficiency frame consistently yields the largest gains in policy support, outperforming both the control condition and all alternative frames, on average. While the effects of covariate conditional frame assignment were modest and not significantly different from assigning the best overall frame, we find consistent positive effects of the efficiency frame across partisan subgroups.

In contrast, another explanation looks at how host country (“contemporary homeland”) politics surrounding the “perpetual foreigners” can push the diaspora toward their ancestral homeland. In this paper, we recognize that the link between the diaspora and the ancestral homeland is malleable. Specifically, we focus on the linguistic link—which can vary both spatially and temporally. We argue that when individuals of the diaspora do not speak the ancestral homeland language with their family at home, the primordial ethnic bond is weakened, and thus, they are less positive toward their ancestral homeland. We test our argument by focusing on the ethnic Chinese diaspora globally. Using the Sinophone Borderlands Survey, we identify and test whether those who speak Standard Chinese at home are more pro-China than their coethnics who speak a non-Standard Chinese vernacular. The results highlight that while the ethnic Chinese diaspora is more positive toward China than the non-ethnic Chinese respondents, what matters is whether a, and if so, which, Chinese vernacular is spoken.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10048", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10048", "journal_full": "Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.5856648771732091}, {"title": "Ideological perceptions and party support in central and Eastern Europe", "authors": "Alexander Davenport", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/21599165.2025.2611934", "doi": "10.1080/21599165.2025.2611934", "journal_full": "East European Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08018579304326201}, {"title": "Disaggregated machine learning via in-physics computing at radio frequency", "authors": "Zhihui Gao, Sri Krishna Vadlamani, Kfir Sulimany, Dirk Englund, Tingjun Chen", "abstract": null, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adz0817", "doi": "10.1126/sciadv.adz0817", "journal_full": "Science Advances", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012800181317257686}, {"title": "Removal of trace gases can both increase and decrease cloud droplet formation", "authors": "Elavarasi Ravichandran, Sanghee Han, Abigail S.

The objectives of this perspective paper are therefore twofold. First, based on partnership ethics and the sociological concept of Uncontrollability , we identify broad values that feed into the concept of human-nature partnerships that respect limits to making Nature controllable. Second, we translate these broad values into four guiding principles that support urban planning to operationalize human-nature partnerships.

Through two pre-registered surveys in Turkey (N=6,286), we find that supporters exposed to propaganda videos feel greater sense of belonging and are more susceptible to engage in pro-government activities. Opponents report heightened anger and anxiety and seem deterred from protesting. However, the latter effect weakened during the highly contested 2023 electoral campaign.

Study Design: A qualitative content analysis design was employed to analyze the communication strategies of the mHealth apps. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted using data from Lao Health Care and Wellness Lao apps, focusing on user interactions and health outcomes from January 2023 to June 2023. Methodology: The analysis involved examining the communication methods of both apps, including personalized messaging, reminders, and gamification features. Data were collected through in-app user feedback, usage statistics, and health outcome metrics. Comparative analysis was performed to assess the effectiveness of each strategy. Results: Lao Health Care's formal communication approach, which emphasized reminders and structured messaging, was found to significantly improve treatment adherence and preventive health practices. Conversely, Wellness Lao's use of gamification and conversational tactics fostered greater user engagement and encouraged sustainable wellness behaviors. Notably, Lao Health Care users demonstrated a 25% increase in adherence rates, while Wellness Lao users exhibited a 30% increase in long-term wellness activities. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of adapting communication strategies to fit the local context and user preferences. Effective integration of personalized, reminder-based, and gamified approaches can enhance user engagement and health outcomes.

Iconicity is also fundamental to the human ability to create meaningful new signals without reliance on convention. This “iconic turn” raises a critical question for the study of language origins: Do great apes use iconic gestures? Apes are well documented to use a flexible and wide-ranging repertoire of gestures, and many appear to be iconic representations of actions, including directive touches, visual directives, and pantomimed actions. However, the most widely accepted theories – ontogenetic ritualization and biological inheritance through phylogenetic ritualization – argue that this apparent form-meaning resemblance is not psychologically real to the apes using the gestures. They argue instead that effective actions are channeled into gestures through repeated use, either through an individual’s experience or over generations of evolution. Yet, it is increasingly recognized that these theories cannot account for the variability and contextual tuning of ape gestures. Alternatively, reasoning from cognitive theories of human gesture and iconicity as rooted in sensorimotor simulation and mental imagery, apes may use a range of gestures that appear homologous to the iconic gestures of humans, even if comparatively restricted in imaginative scope and anchored heavily in a here-and-now context.

While this design may identify changes in native criminal behavior, I demonstrate that it is largely uninformative regarding the difference in crime propensities between immigrants and natives. Because immigrants typically comprise a small fraction of the population, even large group-level differences are mechanically diluted. I formalize the minimum detectable gap - the smallest immigrant-native crime difference these regressions can reliably distinguish from zero given standard design parameters.

Further, the machines showed greater truth bias and low reduced decision confidence relative to humans who outperformed machines in the detection of video deepfakes.

In both experiments, nouns had been presented with a gender-marked determiner. In Experiment 3, we tested a new group of German participants on the same items, which were now presented without determiner; we again observed a small gender effect.

Fifty participants performed a saccadic choice task targeting faces or vehicles presented at 15° eccentricity along the HM and VM. We also assessed the strength of the radial bias and the horizontal tuning for face identity recognition in each individual. As expected, saccades were faster and more accurate towards faces than vehicles; they were also faster along the HM than the VM. Contrary to our hypothesis, the saccadic face advantage did not differ between meridians, suggesting the robustness of face saccadic advantage. However, the saccadic face advantage along the VM correlated with the strength of the horizontal tuning of face identity recognition. Additionally, the radial bias predicted saccade latency towards faces along the HM. These findings indicate that low-level radial biases and high-level face-specialized mechanisms independently contribute to distinct functional aspects of the ultra-fast saccadic responses towards faces.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z5qgk_v3", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/z5qgk_v3", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.020368076799285317}, {"title": "Toward a productive evolutionary understanding of music", "authors": "Samuel Mehr, Max Krasnow, Gregory A.

Late-life suicidality is rapidly increasing; psychotherapy may reduce suicidality, but trajectories of change in suicidality remain unclear. A strong therapeutic alliance may protect against persistent suicidality. We examined the association of alliance with suicidality trajectories during brief, remote interventions for depression. Methods. Sixty middle-aged and older adults with major depression were randomized to brief remote psychosocial interventions. Suicidality and alliance were assessed during treatment. Patients’ suicidality trajectories were classified as: a) absent; b) improved; c) persistent, based on pre- to post-treatment changes. All three groups were included in mixed-effects models to examine the association between suicidality and alliance. Results. At baseline, 53% of patients endorsed suicidality, with 45% in the absent group, 45% improved; and 10% persistent. Patients in the absent and improved groups showed stable, strong alliance while the persistent group showed worsening alliance. Conclusion.

This study delves into the search for the engraved copper plates of the Fourth Buddhist council, hidden at a secret location under a stupa. Divided into two sections, the research aims to locate the Fourth Buddhist council site and identify the housing stupa based on the hypothesis that King Kanishka, being knowledgeable about the Himalayan terrain, would have hidden the plates in a secure place protected from atmospheric and human-induced hazards. Accompanied by Buddhist scholars, Kanishka executed this plan with great secrecy. The research supports the theory that the Kundal-Atholi region in Kishtwar, Kashmir, served as the Fourth Buddhist council site, well-protected by mountains and having fertile land to sustain the council attendees. The Kanika Chorten in Zanskar valley is suggested as not only the housing stupa of the engraved copper plates but also the Buddha's alms bowl, hidden amidst the difficult-to-reach high passes and abundant copper resources. Fountain slabs with water Baolis from Ghora galli to Kundal-Atholi reveal routes to the council, reflecting Kanishka's dedication to Buddhism. Art sculptures of horse riders in the Kesar saga hint at connections between Kesar and King Kanishka's life, aiding in reconstructing Stupa structures using Ghora galli sculptures. The expedition to locate the housing stupa, guided by the Kesar saga, led to Kanika Chorten, and the statues in the cemetery are believed to be made by Kesar of Ling. Verification using metal detectors provided evidence of non-ferrous metal presence under the Kanika chorten's base, supporting the hypothesis. Preservation of Ghora galli, Gool sculptures, water Baolis, and the Fourth Buddhist council location is crucial, as these historical monuments hold immense significance for Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. Unearthing the engraved copper plates will shed light on the Kushan period and Buddhism during Kanishka's reign, honoring the efforts of the people of Zanskar in preserving their historical legacy.

Using online survey experiments with 3,065 college students nationwide, we find that the severity of speech and the target's identity strongly influence support for disciplinary actions in response to objectionable speech. Students generally oppose punishing objectionable speech unless it is deemed highly harmful. Hateful rhetoric targeting minority groups, such as Black, Jewish, Muslim, and transgender individuals, elicits stronger punitive responses than identical statements directed at White students. While students, on average, afford greater protections to minority groups, there is notable variation. Exploratory analysis reveals that students’ responses are shaped by normative principles: about two-thirds believe minority groups should receive greater protection from harmful speech, while one-third advocate universal, equal treatment regardless of the target’s identity. These principles predict responses to speech scenarios, beyond ideology, stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and other personal characteristics. However, commitment to these principles weakens when individuals have a strong stance on the topic.

The manuscript has since been substantially revised, re-analysed, and theoretically reframed. This version should not be cited as the current state of the review. This systematic review examines the relationship between mental health challenges and performance quality among professional musicians. The study was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42025636469). Through an analysis of 18 primary research articles published between 2009 and 2024, we investigate how various mental health issues, particularly Music Performance Anxiety (MPA), affect both objective and subjective aspects of musical performance. The review reveals that mental health challenges significantly impact performance through multiple pathways, including physiological responses (increased heart rate, muscle tension), psychological reactions (anxiety, rumination), and behavioral changes (practice habits, career choices). While moderate levels of anxiety can sometimes enhance performance, excessive anxiety typically leads to deterioration in both technical and artistic aspects of playing. The findings highlight that early life experiences, personality traits, and performance conditions significantly moderate these effects. The review also identifies important research gaps, particularly regarding the impact of depression, burnout, and sleep disorders on musical performance. These findings have important implications for music education, performance preparation, and healthcare support for musicians, suggesting the need for early intervention and personalized anxiety management strategies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/2rpck_v1", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/2rpck_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009827677730977591}, {"title": "Accent Bias and Inequities in Higher Education: A critical perspective on University Students’ Experiences of Accent-Based Disadvantages.", "authors": "Gisela Tomé Lourido, Julia Snell", "abstract": "UK Higher Education (HE) has an increasingly diverse student population due to internationalisation and widening participation strategies, common in universities worldwide.

For Canadian governments, forests are sites of timber extraction that sustain industry. Canadian legislators fail to see the forest for the trees. This case study examines cumulative impacts of Ontario’s forestry legislation on Anishinaabek life ways, focusing our study on food ways. Food ways include cultural, economic, scientific, linguistic, spiritual, and intergenerational dimensions of food in a society. Anishinaabek food ways are affirmed in the 1850 Robinson Huron Treaty, a land sharing agreement between the Anishinaabek Nation and the British Crown. Crown responsibilities for resource ‘management’ was given to Provinces following the BNA Act (1867). We demonstrate ways Ontario forestry legislation disregards the Crown’s Treaty-affirmed obligations to uphold Anishinaabek harvesting rights. This case study begins with Elders’ reflections on glyphosate use in forestry. Forest operators claim herbicide use speeds commercial species regeneration, yet this strategy converts food and medicine-bearing forests to pine plantations lacking the biodiversity upon which Anishinaabek food ways depend. We ask how changes to Ontario’s forestry legislation impact Crown obligations under the Robinson Huron Treaty (1850) to protect Anishinaabek food ways. We examine limitations of settler colonial knowledge systems for understanding the impacts of forest ‘management’ decisions.

This study contends that quantifying attention functions not as an impartial measurement but as a fundamental epistemic framework that dictates what can be understood about attention. By examining proxy-based metrics such as engagement and watch time, it illustrates how these computable indicators gain authoritative status within platform infrastructures, ultimately defining attention rather than merely estimating it. Through an exploration of YouTube’s watch-time economy, this study reveals how a proxy metric is integrated into feedback loops that connect algorithmic optimization, creator efforts, and user actions, creating a self-perpetuating epistemic cycle in which the metric shapes the reality it purports to measure. In this system, issues such as cognitive overload, creative exhaustion, and attentional fatigue do not manifest as quantifiable costs but arise as epistemic externalities—systematically produced yet obscured by the metric’s one-sided logic of accumulation. This study further asserts that this epistemic imbalance extends beyond individual platforms, altering the conditions of democratic attention. The forms of attention crucial to democratic life–sustained, integrative, and deliberative–remain inherently unquantifiable within engagement-focused systems and are thus excluded from institutional recognition and value. Consequently, attention quantification is not merely an economic tactic but a transformation of democracy’s epistemic foundations.

Wealthy national governments can afford both routine payments to prepare for and prevent natural disasters and pandemics, and can afford much larger stimulus and relief payments when they occur, with the former being more cost effective, but the latter having much greater political support. Private preparation for major natural disasters is complicated by laws and social norms against price-gouging that discourage private stockpiling. We argue that governments could ensure efficient, market-driven preparations for many forms of disasters, including pandemics, by entering contingent purchasing contracts that follow the risk-transfer logic of ‘reverse catastrophe bonds.’ I In this model, private suppliers pay for the creation and maintenance of medical countermeasures and other disaster-ready supplies in exchange for the government sponsor agreeing to purchase such private stockpiles at a set premium when a disaster occurs. This would allow governments to avoid unpopular spending on disaster stockpiling, increase societal levels of stockpiling, incentivize private actors to predict and prepare for disasters, and allow the government to distribute emergency goods via social rather than market mechanisms during disasters or pandemics. This model is a form of contingent purchasing agreement related to, but distinct from, advance market commitments.

Drawing on Simondon’s account of technical individuation and Hui’s notion of digital objects, I reconstruct the concretisation of climate KPIs in European sustainability reporting from avoided-emissions claims to scenario-indexed pathways, sectoral intensities, and ESRS-aligned transition-plan disclosures designed for downstream recomputation. I contrast this trajectory with biodiversity disclosure, where indicators often remain procedural and delegative, outsourcing commensuration to future modelling capacities and to spatial “sensitivity layers” that are still missing or unevenly implemented across platforms. A comparison with impairment-testing sensitivities in financial reporting specifies what a mature associated milieu looks like: discounting conventions and parameter disclosures that render uncertainty governable, auditable, and contestable.

Second, and crucially, we show that the protocol generates data of unexpected granularity, granting access to the “creative engine”: the minute-to-minute oscillation between action (what the artist does) and affect (how the work’s evolving form redirects action). This deep analysis allows us to conceptualize the “fertile self”, a productive zone situated between the risks of self-citation (repetition) and self-alienation (loss of agency). Within this zone, the artist is guided by a pre-reflective \"feeling of life\" felt in relation to the artwork-in-the-making. Consequently, the study validates RAO not merely as an observational tool, but as a generative instrument for theory building: the data suggest that the fertile self is structurally similar to Vygotsky’s zone of proximal development where the relation to the artwork acts as the guiding peer.

Emotional regulation is important for learning, and it’s a key part of education, but most research focuses on medical issues rather than the everyday challenges children face in school. The study took place in a school for autistic children. Teachers and teaching assistants worked together to explore how emotions like stress or calmness can be influenced by the school environment. Through group discussions with teachers and classroom observations, the study found that helping children stay calm involves more than just looking at their behaviour. Teachers need to be flexible and understand what each child needs in the moment, since emotions can change quickly. Movement, like allowing children to walk around or take breaks, was found to be really helpful in keeping them regulated. Routine and predictability were also important, but teachers had to stay adaptable to meet each child’s needs. Teachers themselves also needed support, as managing their own stress and working well together as a team were key to helping the children. The study highlighted how important it is to really listen to and understand the children, as misunderstandings about their feelings or interests can lead to more stress for both students and teachers. Future research should look into how differences in attention and interest can affect emotional regulation, to avoid setting unrealistic expectations for the children.

This paper develops a theoretical framework to explain mechanisms of trust exploitation in religious-collectivist communities, with empirical focus on documented fraud cases in Indonesia and the Southeast Asian region. Drawing on synthesis of literature regarding particularized versus generalized trust in social psychology, affinity fraud documentation in fraud prevention research, victimization theory, and empirical case studies, this paper identifies three interacting mechanisms. First, trust calibration mismatch reveals how lived experience in high-trust environments develops trust heuristics optimal for in-group contexts but vulnerable when out-group actors adopt in-group signals. Second, religious rationalization encompasses assumptions about religious deterrence and delegation of justice to God, reducing urgency for verification or formal reporting. Third, temporal familiarity exploitation demonstrates how perpetrators systematically build long-term relationships before large financial extraction. These three mechanisms generate an opportunity structure aligned with Fraud Triangle theory, where detection probability and punishment probability remain low while payoffs are substantial. This paper maintains a critical distinction between religious teachings (which explicitly prohibit deception) and religious identity as social signal (which can be exploited). The vulnerability analyzed is contextual rather than inherent to religiosity itself, emerging from specific configuration of high collectivism, religiosity as dominant identity marker, weak formal institutions, and strong social harmony norms.

We introduce the Criminal Nucleation Framework to model the emergence and persistence of criminal cells through three dimensions: the institutional activation barrier (ΔG), the critical organizational size (r*), and the growth constant (k). Empirical validation shows a structural rupture between 2007 and 2010, where homicide rates shifted from a stable regime (8.5–10 per 100k) to a chronic state (25–29 per 100k). By operationalizing a comparative Kinetic Risk Index (R = k/ΔG), the framework classifies cities into distinct systemic states rather than providing point predictions.

This study introduces a trajectory-based spatiotemporal mismatch (TBSTM) framework that links group-specific mobility rhythms to the spatial and temporal distribution of facilities. Using Amami Oshima, Japan, as a case, we integrate a year-long high-resolution mobility trajectory dataset with mobility network analysis, multimodal accessibility modelling, and a standardized trajectory-based supply-demand index to evaluate disparities in service access for both groups. Results show a clear dual structure of inequality. Local people experience persistent, place-specific shortages in essential services, particularly education, healthcare, and administrative functions-concentrated in peripheral communities such as North, Uken, and Kakeromajima. Tourists, in contrast, face seasonal and service-specific deficits in accommodation, food, and tourism amenities, which intensify from quarter 2 to quarter 4 around gateways and major tourist attractions. Network analysis further indicates that local people provide the stable backbone of the island’s mobility system, whereas tourist flows temporarily thicken key nodes without altering overall connectivity. The study extends spatial mismatch theory by embedding dynamic, group-specific mobility evidence into an operational TBSTM framework.

The debate in this area has extremely grown both nationally and internationally after a series of recorded ballooning of population and the mushrooming of informal settlements in the environs of our cities and towns. This study seeks to explore the project design and implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The objectives considered in this study are: To establish the influence of Project Financing Design and to check the moderating role of Regulatory framework between Project design and the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. To achieve the set objectives, the study develops research hypotheses and was statistically tested at α = 0.05. The theories on which the study was hinged are stakeholder’s theory and open system theory. The study adopts a descriptive research design, and used both qualitative and quantitative approaches. The study looked at a population of 11 affordable housing projects in Nairobi metropolis with 101,565 number of units. Census sampling used a sample of 220 professionals working on the affordable housing projects. These officials are directly involved with project design and the implementation of affordable housing in Nairobi metropolis, Kenya. The study used open-ended and closed-ended questionnaire as the main mode of data collection. Primary data was collected using structured questionnaires. Secondary data was collected from institutional documents, State Department of Housing and Urban Development publications, and relevant publications in referred journals. The collected data was edited, coded and entered into SPSS software for analysis. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. In particular, Regression Analysis was used to investigate the relationships between hypothesized variables. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also used to investigate whether independent variables have a combined effect on the dependent variable. The data was analyzed through the use of descriptive statistics. ANOVA, t-test, Pearson correlation, p- values and coefficient of determination.

When these conditions converge, faculty governance becomes structurally impossible rather than merely politically undermined. The analysis synthesizes findings from recent cross-national studies documenting decollegialization, managerialism, and corporatization trends.

Nairobi Metropolis continues to experience a persistent housing deficit characterized by project delays, cost overruns, quality compromises, and occasional structural failures, despite sustained public and private sector interventions. This study examined the influence of Environmental Assessment Design as a project design practice on the implementation of affordable housing projects in Nairobi Metropolis, Kenya, and further assessed the moderating role of the Regulatory Framework on this relationship. Anchored on a pragmatist research philosophy, the study adopted a descriptive and explanatory research design, utilizing quantitative methods. Primary data were collected from key stakeholders involved in affordable housing projects, including project managers, consultants, contractors, and regulatory officers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test both direct and moderating effects. The findings revealed that Environmental Assessment Design had a statistically significant positive influence on the implementation of affordable housing projects, explaining 26.9% of the variance in implementation outcomes. When the Regulatory Framework was introduced as a moderating variable, the explanatory power of the model increased substantially to 56.8%, indicating a strong enhancement effect. The interaction between Environmental Assessment Design and the Regulatory Framework was positive and significant, confirming that effective regulatory support strengthened the impact of environmental assessment practices on project implementation. The study concluded that successful implementation of affordable housing projects is not only dependent on sound environmental and technical design but is significantly shaped by the effectiveness of regulatory frameworks. Strengthening environmental assessment processes alongside coherent, well-enforced regulatory mechanisms is therefore critical for improving project delivery. The study recommends enhanced regulatory coordination, streamlined approval processes, and capacity building for project and regulatory institutions.

Our results show that women who experience higher short-term variability have their first birth earlier, while those with higher current wealth and long-term wealth variability delay it.

While extensive research has examined the costs of switching between different tasks, it remains unclear whether switching between different control states (relaxed and focused) within a single task carries intrinsic costs. We hypothesized that internally switching between control states while performing a single task incurs a subjective effort cost and, therefore, that people avoid such demands. Additionally, we examined the tradeoff between this cost and an established demand source—interference. We conducted a series of experiments using the Demand Selection Task, where participants chose between different options that yielded lists of Stroop trials. Participants consistently avoided options with high demands for internal state switching (Experiment 1, N = 64) or interference (Experiment 2, N = 86). Regarding the potential tradeoff, Experiment 3 (N = 120) tested whether internal state-switching demands modulate interference costs when both are present, but did not provide evidence for this modulation. However, due to constraints imposed by the structure of the Stroop task, simultaneous manipulation of switching and interference was only possible with relatively weak manipulations for both. To address this, we developed a novel parametric flanker task (Experiment 4, N = 50) that enables strong simultaneous manipulation of both demands. With these stronger manipulations, both switching and interference costs influenced selections, revealing trade-offs between these competing demands (Experiment 5, N = 130).

The study focuses on men and women aged 18–39 and includes both childless individuals and parents aimed at capturing differences in terms of the realisation of fertility intentions at distinct stages of the family life course. Its main contribution lies in examining whether and how the age of the youngest child is associated with the realisation of the fertility intentions of parents. The results reveal that the odds of parents realising their fertility intentions decline substantially as the youngest child grows older, thus suggesting the existence of a relatively narrow time window following a birth for the realisation of intentions to have another child, a factor that has important implications for the design of (tempo-related) family policies.

Embora avanços científico-tecnológicos e transformações socioeconômicas tenham impulsionado a pesquisa e o desenvolvimento de medicamentos, contribuindo para ganhos relevantes, a literatura crítica tem destacado práticas controversas de influência corporativa – aqui sintetizadas como “Influência, Desvios e Excessos” – que favorecem o crescimento, a rentabilidade e a consolidação de poder, por vezes em conflito com o interesse coletivo e a saúde pública. Nesse contexto, este artigo adota delineamento exploratório-descritivo e abordagem mista, com triangulação entre dados públicos, documentos institucionais e revisão crítica da literatura internacional, a fim de mapear e descrever mecanismos de influência corporativa no setor farmacêutico em oito eixos: (i) lobby e financiamento eleitoral; (ii) influência em órgãos de regulação e fiscalização; (iii) influência em organizações de pacientes; (iv) influência na elaboração de diretrizes clínicas; (v) manipulação, promoção e ocultação de pesquisas e testes de medicamentos; (vi) escrita fantasma; (vii) estratégias de ampliação diagnóstica e promoção de doenças; e (viii) financiamento e oferta de benefícios a prescritores e instituições, incluindo mecanismos psicossociais e dimensões formativas. Os achados indicam que a influência corporativa se estrutura em múltiplas escalas e opera de forma simultaneamente visível e difusa. No plano político, evidencia-se a centralidade do lobby e do financiamento eleitoral como instrumentos de conformação do ambiente normativo e regulatório, com expansão progressiva dos investimentos. Na esfera regulatória, a recorrência de conflitos de interesse em comitês consultivos e a circulação de quadros entre agências e empresas sugerem vulnerabilidades à captura institucional, com implicações para os processos de aprovação, fiscalização e retirada de medicamentos. No domínio científico, o patrocínio industrial associa-se a vieses que podem incidir desde o desenho e a condução de ensaios até a publicação seletiva de resultados, além de práticas como ghostwriting e estratégias de “preparação de mercado”, afetando a credibilidade e a circulação das evidências. Em paralelo, observa-se a atuação da indústria na expansão diagnóstica e na medicalização de condições da vida cotidiana, ampliando mercados e podendo invisibilizar determinantes sociais e abordagens não farmacológicas.

Using a preregistered survey experiment fielded through YouGov, respondents evaluated a threat made against a man or woman school board member that varied in severity. We find that threat severity is a critical determinant structuring public judgments. Severe threats are overwhelmingly condemned and classified as violent, whereas mild threats generate greater disagreement and are more often perceived as being a “part of the job.” In contrast, we find little evidence that politician gender affects public tolerance, even in low-severity contexts where we theorize gendered expectations will operate. We demonstrate that this null effect is not driven by cross-cutting hostile or benevolent sexist attitudes. Overall, we find that norms against political violence remain durable, but are less rigid in ambiguous contexts, highlighting the central role of threat severity in shaping public tolerance of political hostility.

Combining full-population registry, election, and survey data from Denmark, we show that social housing residents have become economically marginalized, while left-wing electorates have grown more affluent and educated. Consistent with this divergence, support for the Social Democrats declined in precincts with high concentrations of social housing, and the party ceased to be electorally rewarded for its expansion.

In a preregistered online experiment with 1,893 participants, who submitted over 18,000 prompts and generated more than 300,000 images, users attempted to replicate a target image in 10 tries using one of three randomly assigned models: DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3, or DALL-E 3 with automated prompt rewriting. We find that users with access to DALL-E 3 achieved higher image similarity than those with DALL-E 2—but only about half of this gain (51%) came from the model itself. The other half (49%) resulted from users adapting their prompts in response to the model’s capabilities. This adaptation emerged across the skill distribution, was driven by trial-and-error, and could not be replicated by automated prompt rewriting, which erased 58% of the performance improvement associated with DALL-E 3.

We pre-registered our hypotheses that PI would positively associate with current and predict future TSS severity, beyond emotional distress-related symptoms, namely depression, anxiety, and anger.

However, these taxes are being implemented with little to no empirical evidence backing their effectiveness. Objective: To determine whether Washington, D.C.’s 2003-imposed vacancy tax impacted home prices. Design: A panel data set for the years 1978-2013 was compiled for this analy- sis. Data was collected on 13 different variables related to the housing market for 31 metropolitan statistical areas, including Washington, D.C. The synthetic control method was applied to create a counterfactual Washington, D.C. using the available variables and donor cities. House price comparisons were then made over time to deter- mine what Washington, D.C.’s average house prices would have been absent their 2003 vacancy tax, as measured by the synthetic control unit. Robustness checks, placebo tests, and time series analyses were subsequently used to validate and investigate the primary results. Results: Contrary to expectations, there is a gap following the 2003 treatment that suggests Washington, D.C.’s tax may have increased house prices rather than decreased or limited them. An interrupted time series analysis also shows a statistically significant break in the house price trajectory starting in approximately 2005. However, a placebo in space test casts doubt on any significant results as Washington, D.C.’s outcomes are unremarkable when applying the potential treatment to other U.S. cities. Conclusions and Relevance: There is no evidence that the 2003 tax reduced house prices. Local governments in North America should be cautious about imple- menting vacancy taxes if the primary or sole purpose is to reduce or restrict house prices.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3gwqn_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/3gwqn_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011616451409184547}, {"title": "The Evolutionary Dynamics of Cultural Change (As Told Through the Birth and Brutal, Blackened Death of Metal Music)", "authors": "Bernard Koch, Daniele Silvestro, Jacob G.

We differentiate between plausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responses are reasonable given specific question characteristics and content, and implausible straightlining batteries, where uniform responding is not expected and most likely signals satisficing. Using data from the GESIS Panel.pop, a mixed-mode probability-based panel in Germany, we leverage a layout change that transitioned multi-item batteries from matrix to single-item formats to study plausible and implausible straightlining. Our findings, based on mixed-effects logistic regression models, indicate that respondents are significantly more likely to straightline on plausible than on implausible batteries. While question format does not affect straightlining overall, single-item formats are associated with less straightlining on implausible batteries but more on plausible batteries. Additional analyses show that web respondents are less likely to straightline than mail respondents, and this mode effect is more pronounced in single-item formats.

Both studies asked mothers to report on stressful situations that had happened in the last two hours several times a day. We tested whether phone use in a stressful situation was related to less perceived coping effort and whether decreased coping effort related to more perceived coping efficacy. We find no support for the relation between effort and coping efficacy and mixed support for the relation of phone use and effort.

By Wave 9, when most respondents are in their late 20s, the Germanness of social networks is closely linked to political preferences: native majorities with more German-centric networks are less likely to support left-wing parties, while the inverse is true for most of their immigrant-origin peers. These patterns reflect distinct but complementary mechanisms: for immigrants and their descendants, majority ties signal structural assimilation into “mainstream” political culture and convergence with liberal-cosmopolitan norms; for natives, ethnically diverse social networks reinforce enculturation into progressive political communities.

It shows that new drain estimates rely on untenable premises -- in particular, claims of North-South parity in productivity and export composition.

The effect of this review is a novel hierarchical typology of narratives that frame and justify abuse, which are then analysed through the lens of Bandura’s eight mechanisms of moral disengagement (MD). The core argument proposes that the widespread persistence of IPV is sustained by a system of social coherence, not solely individual pathology. Legitimization operates hierarchically: fundamental societal ideologies provide the foundational Moral Justification, enabling the subsequent activation of individual MD strategies (specifically Dehumanization, Attribution of Blame, and Diffusion of Responsibility) by perpetrators. Crucially, the MD framework is extended to show that these narratives are also mobilized by external observers and social institutions to manage moral discomfort and maintain a predictable social order through defensive attribution and the Belief in a Just World.

Moreover, higher fiscal capacity increases protest costs for citizens, which constitutes a \"silence-buying\" effect, a new term I coin in the context of authoritarian civil resistance. My argument stems from some comparative politics theories and theoretical statements of Jack Goldstone and Theda Skocpol. Using panel data on violent mass anti-regime mobilization from 2003 to 2022 and introducing a novel operationalization of fiscal capacity as central government debt, I employ logistic models for protest onset and negative binomial models for protest counts to estimate the effect of the central government debt on violent contention. Across specifications, robustness checks and zero-inflation corrections, the effect stays significantly positive, suggesting that fiscal constraints pose a destabilizing threat to autocracies. Findings show that fiscal capacity has been overlooked as a viable factor of contention and provide sufficient evidence in favor of a new operationalization of fiscal capacity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zg63s_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zg63s_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005149085537311859}, {"title": "Quantifying the Importance of Change for Understanding Differences in Personal Culture", "authors": "Achim Edelmann, Kevin Kiley, Turgut Keskintürk, Isabella Bouklas, Stephen Vaisey", "abstract": "Studies in the sociology of culture have converged on a general conclusion that while people sometimes make substantial shifts in their personal culture over time, most elements of personal culture are characterized by low rates of persistent change during adulthood.

The release of these locational data provides a rare opportunity to examine the opaque geography of contemporary surveillance and to assess whether ALPR camera deployment reproduces the same racialized and classed patterns long associated with policing and state surveillance in the United States. In this article, we use geographic information systems (GIS) and descriptive statistical analysis to map the distribution of 614 Flock Safety ALPR cameras in relation to racial and poverty profiles of the neighborhoods where the cameras are located. Our findings show that ALPR camera deployment is deeply and systematically racialized and economically stratified, with predominantly Black and high-poverty neighborhoods bearing a disproportionate share of ALPR surveillance infrastructure across Hampton Roads.

Demands for strong forms of coordination between system elements and across institutional spheres increase. However, such systems planning raises distinct capacity and legitimacy demands. The availability of robust institutions for systems planning is therefore a key, hitherto neglected success factor for advanced energy transitions. To develop this argument empirically, we draw on an in-depth qualitative case study of the German energy transition as a paradigmatic case in which successful renewable expansion has led to a growing mismatch between legacy system features and transition affordances. Attempts to address this mismatch through enhanced, whole-of-system coordination oriented towards Germany’s net zero goal have been met with institutional barriers that increase the power of opponents.

This study compared suicidal-related and non-suicidal sessions within a general youth chatline to identify session characteristics and worker skills associated with positive outcomes. Methods: We analyzed 1,710 chat sessions (202,336 messages) from QuickChat, a Singapore youth chatline between 2016 and 2020. Large language models classified sessions as suicidal or self-harm related (n=406, 24%) or non-suicidal (n=1,304, 76%). User-reported outcomes measured service quality and coping ability. Twelve therapeutic skills were coded from 79,587 worker messages. Multilevel regression models examined skill-outcome associations. Results: Suicidal-related sessions were significantly longer, contained more messages, and yielded lower outcomes. Suicidal ideation was most prevalent (85%), followed by self-harm (43%). In suicidal sessions, normalization demonstrated the strongest associations with all outcomes, followed by teaching/psychoeducation and making strengths explicit. These patterns differed substantially from non-suicidal sessions. Conclusion: Suicidal-related sessions within general chatlines demand greater engagement and differentiated responses from workers. Normalization and psychoeducation emerge as effective techniques for improving outcomes in suicidal chats.

This paper provides empirical evidence on mode effects (web, in-person, video interviewing) in the measurement of cognitive abilities using the TestMyBrain Backward Digit Span test (an immediate serial recall task) among adults age 20-40 years in England. Participants completed surveys including the same cognitive test at two time points two weeks apart and were randomly allocated to mode at each wave. The 1,692 wave 1 respondents and 1,510 wave 2 respondents were analysed using mixed effects models to estimate mode effects relating to several assessment outcomes. We found that participation by web was associated with a higher likelihood of an incomplete assessment relative to both in-person and video interviewing, suggesting that the presence of an interviewer – even if not physically present as in video interviewing – enhances the likelihood of a successfully completed test. For participants who completed the cognitive assessment, we found no evidence that the observed mean scores differed by mode, though this appeared to mask some heterogeneity. Although based on small numbers, there was a trend for both web and video respondents to be more likely to obtain the highest test scores than those participating in-person. This is consistent with prior suggestions that individuals in modes where there is limited or no interviewer presence are more likely to cheat. Mean test scores were consistently higher at wave 2 than at wave 1, with this ‘retest gain’ differing little by mode.

Using monthly-level discrete-time event history models, the analysis accounts for demographic, socio-economic, and contextual confounders, and further investigates the moderating role of pre-existing climate change attitudes and behaviours. The results show that exposure to both types of natural hazards is associated with a temporary reduction in the monthly probability of conception. Heatwaves, in particular, show a strong and highly significant association, with conception probabilities declining sharply during months of exposure. Floods show a weaker yet still negative association, observed in the six months immediately following the event. Furthermore, environmental behaviours appear to play a moderating role in the case of floods: only individuals reporting environmentally friendly behaviours experience a temporary decline in conception probabilities after flood exposure, followed by a modest rebound thereafter.

Method: This realist review followed the iterative stages outlined by Pawson and was conducted in accordance with the RAMESES standards. This methodology allows for the inclusion of peer-reviewed publications and grey literature, with appraisal focusing on the relevance, rigour, and richness of included data. Evaluations of animations promoting preventative health behaviours to any age population, and employing any design or comparator were included.

I illustrate this using computational, biological, military, governmental, and economic systems. Contemporary AI typically relies on static, human-engineered stacks whose lower layers are fixed during deployment. Put provocatively, such systems resemble inflexible bureaucracies that adapt only top-down. Biological systems are more intelligent because they delegate adaptation. Formally, I prove a theorem (\\emph{The Law of the Stack}) showing that adaptability at higher layers is bottlenecked by adaptability at lower layers. I further show that, under standard viability assumptions, maximising adaptability is equivalent to minimising variational free energy, implying that delegation is necessary for free-energy minimisation. Generalising bioelectric accounts of cancer as isolation from collective informational structures, I analyse cancer-like failure modes in non-biological systems when delegation is inadequate.

In higher education, instructors must form short-lived teams using limited data while balancing pedagogical goals and logistical constraints, conditions that differ sharply from professional team settings. To address this fragmentation, this study develops an integrated taxonomy of educational TFP grounded in a systematic review of 35 peer-reviewed studies. Building upon perspectives from Operations Research, Organizational Psychology, and Educational Research, the taxonomy organizes TFP variants into three interrelated pillars: (1) Input attributes, which specify the student attributes used to form teams; (2) Problem formulation, which describes how attributes are manipulated and formalizes pedagogical objectives and constraints into optimization model; and (3) Solution methods, which describe the algorithms used to generate feasible team assignments. This structure clarifies the modeling decisions that underpin different TFP variants and provides a common vocabulary for describing them, enabling transparent reporting and meaningful comparison between studies that previously lacked a shared frame of reference.

These highly traumatic conditions pose severe psychological threats to Palestinians and may have reverberating effects in neighboring Arab countries. This scoping review aimed to examine the direct and indirect mental health consequences of Israel’s genocidal assault on Gazans, Palestinian citizens outside of Gaza, and populations in neighboring Arab countries and also investigated processes of coping and resilience among Palestinians. Methods: Following (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines, 42 articles, which were published after October 2023, were identified from five major search engines, including PubMed, Scopus, SpringerLink, Proquest, and Google Scholar. Studies investigated the psychological impacts of the 2023 genocide in Gaza, and their results were categorized into three groups: psychological impacts of wars, resilience, and coping strategies studies under war circumstances. Results: Findings revealed devastating mental health effects due to the genocide, with Gazans experiencing the most extreme outcomes. Gazan samples reported alarmingly high prevalence rates of mental health symptoms, including depression (72.7-99.5%), anxiety (65.0-99.7%), and PTSD (63.4-83.5%), which were the highest among all examined groups. Resilience and coping resources among Palestinians included cognitive strategies, family and social support, and religion. Conclusion: These findings highlight the large-scale psychological consequences of the 2023 Gazan genocide and underscores the urgent need for emergency mental health interventions in Palestine.

Methods: Items from five surveys used in the Stockholm Region were coded into content areas. Cognitive interviews (n = 19) were analysed for response processes. Rasch analyses were conducted on the Swedish Crime Survey (n = 4,264) and the City of Stockholm Crime Survey (n = 7,333). Results: The surveys covered overlapping topics but used distinct phrasings. Response comprehension was generally adequate, yet some terms were interpreted differently. Respondents found it difficult to isolate fear of crime from other motives in the consequence items. There was no clear advantage to either frequency- or consequence-framed items, whereas intensity stems imposed a lower response burden. Psychometrically, unidimensional solutions were hard to achieve for either crime type or consequence item sets. The evidence suggests heterogeneity across population groups. Conclusions: Current practice involves both strengths and weaknesses. This study suggests paths toward enhanced measurement of the fear of crime. Measuring fear of crime as a single, invariant latent trait is far from straightforward.

We propose that perceptions of anomie—the belief that society’s social and political fabric is crumbling—can influence support for redistribution in opposing ways. When people see society as deteriorating, they may seek drastic change, increasing support for redistribution. Conversely, viewing society as descending into anomie may also foster a belief that the government will mismanage redistributed wealth, thereby reducing support. Study 1 examined these relationships in a U.S. sample, confirming the presence of these two opposing pathways, and Study 2 then replicated the findings in the UK. Study 3 tested this model experimentally, introducing the ‘anomie paradigm’ to explore how perceptions of anomie cause shifts in psychology. Here, participants were exposed to a fictitious society characterized by high or low anomie. The high (relative to low) anomie condition increased support for redistribution through a desire for change but simultaneously decreased support via concerns over government misuse.

Results The results reveal a structured social representation of second-hand shopping that is predominantly practice-oriented and economically anchored, with strong emphasis on affordability and waste avoidance, with environmental concerns emerging in central elements. Five distinct cognitive clusters were identified, differing in their configurations of economic, moral, environmental, and pragmatic meaning constructions. CE-related behavioural engagement (particularly buying used, buying less, and zero-waste practices) was more strongly associated with cluster formation than sociodemographic characteristics.

While previous research suggests that (civilian) deaths shape the probability of negotiations, it shows that the effect can take two directions. As increasing death tolls mean higher conflict costs, they can lower the probability of negotiations. At the same time, civilian killings may increase the conflict’s intractability and decrease trust between the parties, thus lowering the probability of negotiations. I argue that the direction of the effect of civilian targeting depends on insurgent ideology. When the insurgents’ extremity is low, they can use civilian targeting to exert power and pressure the government into negotiations. When their extremity is high, civilian targeting is more likely to have the opposite effect: Killing civilians can lower trust in the insurgents and entrench cleavages in society. Apart from this moderated effect via civilian killings, I also expect extremity to have a direct effect on the probability of conflict parties entering into meaningful negotiations. As high extremity increases both commitment and indivisibility problems, insurgents are less likely to meaningfully negotiate with increasing extremity.

Through theoretical genealogy and synthesis of empirical literature on influencer culture, three interrelated dimensions are elaborated: algorithmic co-authorship of selfhood, distributed agency between human intention and computational prediction, and algorithmically mediated retribalization. The framework specifies how AI’s generative role operates within platform-based political economies, offering new conceptual vocabulary for understanding how machine learning reconfigures authorship, decision-making, and community formation under contemporary digital conditions.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xejpf_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/xejpf_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.010774439408608227}, {"title": "Lighthouse Construction and China's Foreign Trade in the late 19th Century", "authors": "Khon Long Chia", "abstract": "This paper explores the transformative role lighthouses played in shaping China’s 19th-century maritime trade. In the aftermath of the Opium War and the opening of international treaty ports, the Chinese Maritime Customs Service (CMC), under the leadership of Robert Hart, launched a concerted effort to illuminate the nation’s dark and hazardous coastline. By examining annual trade reports alongside the construction dates and locations of new lighthouses, I discovered that ports such as Shanghai, Chinkiang, and Kiukiang saw increases in commercial activity, often doubling or even tripling annual trade volume after the installation of navigational aids. To further support this correlation, this paper draws on qualitative sources, including commissioner reports, lighthouse keeper accounts, and decennial customs records, to provide firsthand insights into how lighthouses functioned not only as safety mechanisms but also as symbols of state authority. They deterred local resistance, reinforced imperial presence, and contributed to a more secure and predictable maritime environment. In doing so, lighthouses helped establish reliable channels for international commerce, reducing the risk of shipwreck or cargo loss and ultimately fostering trust in China’s coastal trade routes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9h5mw_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/9h5mw_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.0536839997515981}, {"title": "Environmental Performance in Transition: An Empirical Examination of Greece through the EPI Framework", "authors": "Prof. Dr. George E. Halkos, Dr. Argyro Zisiadou", "abstract": "The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) is a widely recognized tool developed by Yale University and Columbia University, in partnership with the World Economic Forum, to assess countries' environmental performance using 58 performance indicators across 11 issue categories. The EPI provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating environmental health, ecosystem vitality and climate change. Greece, as a member of the European Union (EU), operates within a complex regulatory framework aimed at promoting sustainable development. Greece's performance in the EPI reflects both its environmental policy efforts and its exposure to regional challenges such as air pollution, biodiversity loss, and climate-related risks. In recent years, Greece has demonstrated progress in areas such as renewable energy development and climate change mitigation, although issues like waste management and air quality continue to require focused policy intervention. Analyzing Greece’s EPI score offers valuable insights into its environmental priorities and the effectiveness of national strategies aimed at promoting sustainability and resilience.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/egchs_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/egchs_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02062272745511684}, {"title": "Under what institutional and incentive conditions do skill-development subsidies outperform direct wage support in improving long-term labour market outcomes in India?", "authors": "Aishwarya Ravikumar", "abstract": "Governments seeking to raise labour productivity face a persistent policy dilemma between providing direct wage support and subsidising skill development. While wage support can stabilise incomes and boost labour supply in the short term, skill-development subsidies are often promoted as a means of enhancing long-term employability and productivity, though their effectiveness varies widely across contexts. This paper asks: under what institutional and incentive conditions do skill-development subsidies outperform direct wage support in improving long-term labour market outcomes? Using a comparative policy analysis based on secondary data from OECD, World Bank, and ILO evaluations, the paper examines how labour market incentives, employer participation, and institutional capacity shape policy performance. The analysis finds that skill-development subsidies generate superior long-term outcomes when programs are closely aligned with labour market demand, supported by credible employer involvement, and implemented by institutions capable of enforcing targeting and quality standards. In the absence of these conditions, direct wage support often delivers more predictable short- to medium-term results. The paper contributes to the labour economics literature by emphasising the conditional nature of policy effectiveness and by identifying design principles for integrating income support with human capital investment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/db8fc_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/db8fc_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005998047710479626}]
