Publics prefer war only for large prospective power shifts, but preventive war renders the true size of averted shifts unobservable, incentivizing leaders to lie ex post to avoid political punishment. When publics are ex ante skeptical over shift size and war outcomes are middling, the probabilities of war and political punishment, as well as public skepticism over averted shifts and the chances of erroneous punishment, all increase in war outcomes. Public strategies of punishing military failures are particularly unsuccessful at discouraging undesirable preventive wars, yet the same conditions that encourage preventive war undermine its political benefits. We use our model to explain why Japan's leaders failed to convince the public of preventive success against Russia in 1905.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12984","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12984","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4296,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Partisan sorting, fatalism, and Supreme Court legitimacy","authors":"Nicholas T.

First, we construct a data set of surveys from 2012 to 2024 to show that diffuse support now diverges among partisans; we then analyze an original, six‐wave panel survey that reveals the stability of this partisan sorting. Second, we unpack the direct and indirect effects of partisanship on legitimacy: Democrats are more cynical about the Court, disapprove of its outputs, and view obedience to the law differently than Republicans, which contributes to the profound partisan gap in legitimacy. Finally, we reevaluate the relationship between specific and diffuse support by introducing a new measure of specific support, which shows that “fatalistic” views of the Supreme Court contribute to low levels of legitimacy. Today, Democrats’ pessimism toward the Court has eliminated decades of positivity and goodwill. This fatalistic sorting among large swaths of the public implies that the Court's authority now rests on weak and polarized foundations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12972","doi":"10.1111/ajps.12972","journal_full":"American Journal of Political Science","dist":0.4864,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Global competition, local unions, and political representation: Disentangling mechanisms","authors":"Michael Becher, Daniel Stegmueller","abstract":"While recent scholarship has demonstrated multiple political effects of international trade, less attention has been paid to unbundling the mechanisms through which import competition affects democratic politics.

Can polarized individuals be persuaded to choose democracy over party, that is, support a candidate from an opposing party who upholds democratic norms when their co-partisan candidate fails to do so? We tested the effect of an online civic education intervention conducted on over 41,000 individuals in thirty-three countries that was designed to promote the choice of ‘democracy’ by emphasizing the benefits of democratic versus autocratic regimes. The results are striking: exposure to civic education messages significantly dampens the negative effect of partisan polarization on anti-democratic co-partisan candidate choice.

Combining an analysis of observational data measuring crimes against politicians with evidence from original and pre‐registered survey experiments, we first demonstrate that attacks on political elites are not associated with fewer female candidates on party lists for local elections. Examining political ambitions and underlying microfoundations with different samples of respondents varying in their likelihood of considering political candidacy, we provide survey‐experimental evidence that information about the prevalence of political crime does not reduce willingness to run for office or engage in politics among female respondents with high political interest but may do so among those with low political interest.

Employing detailed data from the OECD’s Gender Equality Policy Marker, we show that donors engage differently with democracies and autocracies. Among democratic recipients, those with higher legal status for women have less gender mainstreaming aid, suggesting a “needs-based” logic. Conversely, in autocracies, donors respond positively to policy cues indicating the (domestic) political acceptability of gender equality.

Researchers and firms may seek to evade national rules by relocating to more permissive jurisdictions. Second, public unease about new technologies creates the potential for backlash in the wake of controversial applications. This backlash can spill across borders: accidents or misuse in one jurisdiction undermine support for research and commercial development elsewhere. Together, these processes link the regulatory fate of states, undermining their ability to regulate in isolation. We test and find evidence for these mechanisms in the domain of gene editing, a field that has been transformed by the introduction of CRISPR technology in 2012.

Third, we contribute to debates on destination choices by empirically testing the likelihood of internal displacement versus seeking refuge abroad. Using dynamic models and unique comparative data from the OneUA project, which surveyed 24,000 Ukrainian women in Ukraine and eight other European countries, we examine the migration behaviors of those who stayed in their pre-war residence, relocated internally (internally displaced persons), or fled abroad during the first 6 months of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Our findings reveal a curvilinear relationship between conflict-induced violence and migration propensity: violence initially increases migration but diminishes beyond a threshold. We also find that forewarnings and indirect threats have a stronger influence on migration than direct threats. Violence catalyzes migration among vulnerable groups, narrowing demographic disparities in migration propensity. However, resourceful individuals retain an advantage in early migration, perpetuating inequalities in escape opportunities. Additionally, we observe distinct patterns of internal versus international migration in response to stronger conflict-induced violence, providing theoretical and empirical insights into the dynamics of wartime migration.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00223433251317838","doi":"10.1177/00223433251317838","journal_full":"Journal of Peace Research","dist":0.6054,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The challenges of surveying in war zones: Lessons from Ukraine","authors":"Kit Rickard, Gerard Toal, Kristin M Bakke, John O’Loughlin","abstract":"Conflict scholars commonly employ public opinion surveys to understand the causes and consequences of violence.

We designed psychological interventions, presented as news articles, and tested which ones increased mainstream Jewish majority group members' support for the Palestinian Arab minority's political inclusion in coalition formation in Israel. We employed this context, where the perceived ties between the minority's identity and the identity of the rival in the ongoing conflict make the threat particularly salient, in two critical timepoints: the run‐up to a decisive election (Study 1, N = 1248) and during an ongoing war (Study 2, N = 1391). We found that during the run‐up to the election, interventions targeting value conflict, tension reduction, and norm perceptions increased support for political inclusion, but none of them had the same effect during the war. These findings illustrate the potential of a real‐world intervention tournament, with implications for the promotion of political inclusion in the field.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70030","doi":"10.1111/pops.70030","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.6306,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Values and prejudice in American opinion about immigration: A critical dialog","url":"https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70021","doi":"10.1111/pops.70021","journal_full":"Political Psychology","dist":0.6292,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The paradox of the mixed semi-compensatory system in South Korea: gaming the system or toeing the mark?","authors":"Woojin Moon, Myung Chul Kim","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11127-025-01280-7","doi":"10.1007/s11127-025-01280-7","journal_full":"Public Choice","dist":0.3513,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Violence Against Politicians Drives Support for Political Violence Among (Some) Voters: Evidence from a Natural Experiment","authors":"Alessandro Nai, Patrick F A van Erkel, Linda Bos","abstract":"We investigate whether a real-world episode of physical violence committed in October 2023 against Thierry Baudet, leader of the Dutch far-right FvD, conditioned a differential support for political violence among different voters: voters ideologically close to the target of the attack (in-group) and voters experiencing partisan Schadenfreude toward the party of the target (out-group). The unexpectedness of the attack makes it an excellent case of exogenous treatment in a natural experiment (“Unexpected Event during Survey Design). The fact that the attack occurred in the midst of a survey unfolding a rolling cross-section design yields likely more robust estimations than usually found in similar natural experiments. Our results indicate that the attack against Baudet slightly normalized political violence in the short term. While no specific uptick of support for violence was measured among respondents close to the FvD, in the short and medium term the attack furthermore slightly increased support for violence among respondents who dislike the FvD and experience partisan Schadenfreude.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf010","doi":"10.1093/poq/nfaf010","journal_full":"Public Opinion Quarterly","dist":0.5202,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"New tree, growing forrest: Updating meta-analytic evidence on solidarity between U.S. people of color through an extension and partial replication","authors":"Ramona Alhambra, Emily Ortiz, Efrén Pérez, Tricia Huynh, Haneen Bany-Mohammed, Kiana Rad, Dylan Sherrill, Raymond Castillo, Nicole Crawford","abstract":"Published meta-analytic evidence shows that across five experiments, shared discrimination triggers solidarity between U.S. people of color (PoC), which then strongly correlates with support for pro-outgroup policies. Mini meta-analyses like these remain informative only if all conceptually similar experiments—regardless of statistical significance—are evaluated. We amend this meta-analytic record by adding a new study that only partially replicated the established solidarity pattern. Specifically, our study evaluated whether PoC solidarity encompasses Palestinian people: a racially stigmatized outgroup outside U.S. borders. We tested this through a pre-registered experiment with Black adults ( N = 851), the prototypical person of color. Unexpectedly, we find that exposure to shared discrimination with Palestinians insignificantly affected Black solidarity with PoC. This pattern arises despite exploratory analyses showing that PoC solidarity incorporates Palestinian people. Nevertheless, we still find that Black camaraderie with PoC strongly correlates with pro-Palestinian attitudes, which reaffirms prior work. Finally, with this partial replication included, we meta-analyze all six available solidarity mechanisms through a random effects model. This analysis reveals that PoC solidarity remains a viable mechanism behind inter-minority solidarity. Our results have implications for PoC solidarity and the regular updating of meta-analytic evidence in political science.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20531680251335651","doi":"10.1177/20531680251335651","journal_full":"Research & Politics","dist":0.6043,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Can ChatGPT accurately identify the position of parties?

In a validation exercise, we asked ChatGPT and a group of local experts to simultaneously estimate the positions of French political parties in the context of the 2024 European election on a series of issues from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey. We find that ChatGPT’s estimations are generally close to those of the expert survey, especially for major and salient political issues (left-right, European integration, immigration). However, it provides less accurate estimates on fringe issues (free market, asylum policies, urban–rural interests) and specific party characteristics (within-party division, issue blurring).

The article presents practice mapping as an analytical framework and outlines its key methodological considerations. Given its prominence in past social media research, we draw on examples and data from the platform formerly known as Twitter to enable experienced scholars to translate their approaches to a practice mapping paradigm more easily, but point out how data from other platforms may be used in equivalent ways in practice mapping studies.

But for the connective democratic benefits to be realized, these user corrections should ideally come from those who express strong support for democratic norms. Using a nationally representative survey of Americans immediately after the 2020 U.S. presidential election, we find the opposite is true: self-reported correctors also tended to support political violence to achieve their goals. Rather than treating self-reported correction as a clear positive force for democracy, researchers and practitioners should consider the potential drawbacks and limitations of self-reported correction, particularly when coming from those with less supportive attitudes toward connective democracy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251335086","doi":"10.1177/20563051251335086","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.466,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The Quality of Connections: Deliberative Reciprocity and Inclusive Listening as Antidote to Destructive Polarization Online","authors":"Katharina Esau","abstract":"Conflict and disagreement are integral to healthy democracies, but the extreme polarization observed on many social media platforms poses a serious risk to the core functions of public communication.

It introduces and refines the concept of destructive polarization and its symptoms—manifested in user-generated content on social media platforms—and applies connective democracy theory to examine these symptoms’ underlying causes. The framework shifts from the dominant focus on the quality of individual communication acts to a focus on the quality of connections, particularly within dyadic communication. Through this relational perspective, the article explores how reciprocity and listening can serve as remedies to destructive polarization, fostering high-quality connections between citizens online.

Yet, social media is incredibly heterogeneous and variation in platform affordances may result in markedly different democratic outcomes. In this article, we turn to the principles of connective democracy to inform a cross-topic and cross-platform analysis. Our mixed-methods study compares conversations across Twitter and Reddit, finding that Twitter conversations are highly polarized across topics while Reddit displays some promise for enabling productive, intergroup discourse. We argue that this difference is driven by an affordance of conversational visibility in which users can see and engage with conversations as a whole. We further argue that “community” is a distinctive platform affordance that emerges from shared user expectations. This affordance supports user socialization into democratic norms of productive intergroup contact and therefore may prove particularly important to enhancing connective democracy.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251332427","doi":"10.1177/20563051251332427","journal_full":"Social Media + Society","dist":0.5065,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Transforming cybersecurity with agentic AI to combat emerging cyber threats","authors":"Nir Kshetri","url":"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102976","doi":"10.1016/j.telpol.2025.102976","journal_full":"Telecommunications Policy","dist":0.2423,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Between Government and Market: The Political Economics of Labor Unions","authors":"Ethan Kaplan, Suresh Naidu","abstract":"We survey and summarize recent literature on labor unions in political economy.

Using newly digitized historical records, I find that the Act resulted in significant improvements in school supply and attendance, which in turn improved adult outcomes. In particular, analysis using a regression kink design suggests that public school access improved a child’s chance of obtaining an occupation requiring literacy in adulthood by as much as 17 pp. I use a triple difference specification to show that the effect extended to children further removed from the kink, and that the quality of occupational outcomes increased with each additional year of schooling. To study the reform’s effect on intergenerational mobility, I link father-son pairs across time, matching nearly 4 million individuals using full-count historical censuses. I find that by targeting the lower classes, public school introduction significantly improved intergenerational mobility across numerous measures, with the adult outcome gap between high- and low- class children decreasing by over 10% in some cases.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ej/ueaf031","doi":"10.1093/ej/ueaf031","journal_full":"Economic Journal","dist":0.4969,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Competition, Cooperation, and Social Perceptions","authors":"Jeanne Hagenbach, Rachel Kranton","abstract":"Can competition or cooperation for economic gain affect people’s social perceptions of others?

We find empirical support for both intertemporal and cross-product substitution effects: Households (1) shift consumption forward preceding a tax increase and (2) substitute one good for another and alter their relative weight in the consumption basket to avoid paying higher tax. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that consumers with more personal shopping experience exhibit stronger consumption responses. Our findings have empirical implications for the efficacy of tax policy initiatives.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/rest_a_01584","doi":"10.1162/rest_a_01584","journal_full":"Review of Economics and Statistics","dist":0.4077,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"A Lifecycle Estimator of Intergenerational Income Mobility","authors":"Ursula Mello, Martin Nybom, Jan Stuhler","abstract":"Lacking lifetime income data, most intergenerational mobility estimates are subject to lifecycle bias.

The wellbeing of migrant professionals across professional and personal environments","authors":"Gregor Schäfer, Miguel Morillas","abstract":"Highly skilled migration is increasing both in absolute terms and as a relative share of international migration. The increasing number of migrant professionals (MPs) raises questions about the consequences of their migration - for themselves, for society and for the employing companies. While the wellbeing of different occupational groups is well researched, the wellbeing of migrant professionals remains understudied. In particular, migration studies have not yet captured the implications of migrant professionals’ wellbeing. We theorise an understanding of wellbeing that integrates both professional (workplace) and personal (family and non-work socialisation) dimensions. Following Allardt’s conceptualisation of wellbeing as ‘Having, Loving, Being’, we answer the question of how and what affects migrants’ subjective wellbeing in their professional and personal spaces. We show how the professional-personal interface is defined in the context of transnational labour mobility. To do so, we draw on our unique sample of 42 two-stage interviews with 21 MPs recruited from abroad to high-level positions in Danish companies. We identify four key factors that affect migrants’ wellbeing at the intersection of their professional and personal lives: 1) social alienation at work, 2) professional autonomy, 3) work-leisure balance, and 4) perceptions of equality and meritocracy. Our work is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors that shape migrant professionals’ wellbeing in the context of their personal and professional lives.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00447-x","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00447-x","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.5876,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Pluralist diversity governance: deepening the multiculturalism-interculturalism nexus","authors":"F. Mansouri, A.

Recently, these debates have particularly centred on what would constitute an optimal approach to managing group diversity and intercultural relations, in a context of global migration challenges, pandemic-related inequalities, rising levels of racism, and international conflicts. While much of the recent literature has focused on whether the two dominant approaches, multiculturalism and interculturalism, offered distinct alternatives, there has been little agreement so far, both at the theoretical and policy levels, on the specific direction future diversity governance should take. This article critically examines this contested discourse by reframing diversity as a multi-layered state of being and knowing, that can be understood beyond mere factual differences among ethno-cultural groups. This reframing is pursued by laying out an interactive framework between the hardware and software of pluralism, centred around key normative articulations in relation to cultural recognition, social justice, intergroup solidarity, and political representation. Such a multi-level approach envisages intercultural understanding being realized not against but within a broader of multicultural context and policy setting.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40878-025-00446-y","doi":"10.1186/s40878-025-00446-y","journal_full":"Comparative Migration Studies","dist":0.6295,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Second-generation education and earnings across birth cohorts: ethno-racial variations in Canada","authors":"Rupa Banerjee, Jeffrey Reitz, Feng Hou, Wendell Nii Laryea Adjetey","url":"https://doi.org/10.1080/01419870.2025.2490815","doi":"10.1080/01419870.2025.2490815","journal_full":"Ethnic and Racial Studies","dist":0.4761,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"What do indigenous parties want?

This transnational family separation, which often lasts years, can potentially have long lasting negative consequences on migrant parents’ mental health. Qualitative research has documented that transnational parents often report feelings of guilt, sadness and loneliness due to the separation, and that financial or legal precarity can exacerbate these feelings. On the other hand, quantitative research on this topic is scarce, mostly based on relatively small samples and on cases studies of single origin groups in single destination countries, has measured transnational parents’ mental health disadvantage using less than ideal control groups, and has not investigated potential long-lasting consequences of separation after reunification. In this article, I contribute to this literature using data from the French survey Trajectoires et Origines 2 to investigate differences in propensity to have experienced depression symptoms between transnational immigrant parents, parents who migrated with their children, and immigrant parents who reunited with their children after a period of transnational separation. I additionally look at heterogeneities by gender, age of the children, legal status, employment, and partnership dissolution. I find that transnational parents have significantly worse mental health than immigrants who migrated with their children, especially when the separation involves young children. The mental health of formerly transnational parents does not differ significantly from that of parents who migrated with their children, suggesting the absence of lasting effects of separation after reunification.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251329038","doi":"10.1177/01979183251329038","journal_full":"International Migration Review","dist":0.5819,"specialized":true,"preprint":false},{"title":"Mothering from the Margins: Ethnographic Reflections on the Gendered Politics of Rohingya Mothers in India","authors":"Raksha Gopal","abstract":"This article analyses the everyday experiences of stateless Rohingya refugee women mothering and raising families within refugee settlements in Delhi.

These gendered expectations increase women's caregiving and social reproduction responsibilities while simultaneously limiting their mobility, access to employment, resources, and social support. Secondly, I demonstrate how Rohingya mothers continuously negotiate a sense of security for themselves and their children against the insecurities engendered by formal governance systems of the Indian State. Finally, I explore how non-state humanitarian organizations and NGOs play a crucial role in the governance of refugee women, shaping not only their access to resources and aid but also women's identities and roles as mothers.

Coverage and completeness of registration systems are critical for the quality of these indicators. However, under registration of deaths is still a major problem today, especially where registration systems are still in the process of being established, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries. In the last two decades, Türkiye stands out with its rapidly declining child and infant mortality, as well as its developing VR system. However, the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system in Türkiye has not been fully evaluated yet. The fact that the regions in Türkiye that are disadvantaged in terms of early‐age mortality are less populated poses the risk of neglecting areas that need more investment and improvement in child mortality and data quality. In this study, we assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths at the national and regional levels by using a recently developed model for estimating under‐5 mortality by detailed age. We apply this model at both the national and regional levels to assess the completeness of under‐5 deaths in the VR system of Türkiye from 2009 to 2022. The results confirm the presence of early death omission in the eastern regions at the beginning of the studied period, for which we propose a correction. The prediction of the model also indicates a strong improvement over time in the completeness of death registration in these regions.

Prior work has focused largely on how interdisciplinarity relates to outcomes for published papers, but which papers get accepted for publication in the first place is unclear. Furthermore, journals may evaluate two key dimensions of interdisciplinarity,—topic and knowledge base,—differently. Topic interdisciplinarity (measured through title and abstract) may incur evaluation penalties by cutting across disciplinary evaluation standards and threatening symbolic boundaries, while knowledge-base interdisciplinarity (measured through references) may incur benefits by combining a large pool of nonredundant information. Evaluations may also depend on how well these dimensions align with each other and the intended audience. We test these arguments using data on 128,950 submissions to 62 journals across STEM disciplines, including both accepted and rejected manuscripts. We find that a 1SD increase in knowledge-base interdisciplinarity is associated with a 0.9 percentage-point higher acceptance probability, while a 1SD increase in topic interdisciplinarity corresponds to a 1.2 percentage-point lower acceptance probability. However, the penalty for high topic-interdisciplinarity diminishes when knowledge-base interdisciplinarity is also high, and when submitted to journals designated as “interdisciplinary.” These findings challenge the narrative of a uniform bias against interdisciplinary research and highlight the importance of distinguishing between its dimensions, as well as their alignment with each other and the intended audience.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409752122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2409752122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4853,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Bridging life satisfaction data and neurobiological measures would elucidate human well-being","authors":"Anthony Brandt, Cokorda Bagus Jaya Lesmana, Elkhonon Goldberg","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2502095122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2502095122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3013,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Unbalanced social–ecological acceleration led to state formation failure in early medieval Poland","authors":"Adam Izdebski, Sambor Czerwiński, Marek Jankowiak, Marcin Danielewski, Sabina Fiołna, Raphael Gromig, Piotr Guzowski, Negar Haghipour, Irka Hajdas, Piotr Kołaczek, Mariusz Lamentowicz, Katarzyna Marcisz, Jakub Niebieszczański, Paweł Sankiewicz, Bernd Wagner","abstract":"Rapid social–ecological intensification is a recurrent feature of human history.

Triggered by the Eurasian slave trade, the first “Polish” polity was founded in Central Europe c. 900 common era. It undertook unprecedented ecological intensification in its core territory, connected with large construction projects, and engaged in rapid territorial expansion. We provide new crucial evidence on this process by publishing here a high-resolution pollen profile from a location close to the polity’s capital and by an application of social network analysis to numismatic data. This state collapsed within a few generations after its foundation. The collapse of the political elites, however, did not produce a complete social and ecological disintegration of the polity’s former core region. We thus show how collapse and continuity can remain closely intertwined. Last but not least, the rich evidence on the mechanism of the collapse reveals that successful maintenance of social–ecological intensification requires reliance on a number of cultural, economic, religious, and social networks underlying the political expansion. The polity’s elite lacked access to or failed to mobilize such networks, which led to its demise.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2409056122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2409056122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.4092,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Identifying air quality monitoring deserts in the United States","authors":"Nelson A.

While most research has focused on the association between air quality estimates and these outcomes, little is known about the presence of air quality monitoring sites across the United States or the place-level characteristics associated with such placements. We classify counties without a monitoring station as air quality monitoring deserts. Using the Environmental Protection Agency’s AirData active sites directory, we determine the number and location of monitoring deserts. We then study whether demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are associated with the likelihood of a county being a monitoring desert. Our results indicate that 1,848 or 58.8% of US counties are an air quality monitoring desert, covering about 40% of the nation’s land area. Our estimates suggest that more than 50 million people or 15.3% of the population live in air quality monitoring deserts.

Reich, Kathryn Grace, Arun Agrawal, Harini Nagendra","abstract":"Mitigating climate change and social injustice are critical, interwoven challenges. Climate change is driven by grossly unequal contributions to elevated greenhouse gas emissions among individuals, socioeconomic groups, and nations. Yet, its deleterious impacts disproportionately affect poor and less powerful nations, and the poor and the less powerful within each nation. This climate injustice prompts a call for mitigation strategies that buffer the poorest and the most vulnerable against climate change impacts. Unfortunately, all emissions mitigation strategies also reshape social, economic, political, and ecological processes in ways that may create climate change mitigation injustices—i.e., a unique set of injustices not caused by climate change, but by the strategies designed to stem it. Failing to stop climate change is not an answer—this will swamp all adverse impacts of even unjust mitigation in terms of the scope and scale of disastrous consequences. However, mitigation without justice will create uniquely negative consequences for the more vulnerable. The ensuing analysis systematically assesses how climate change mitigation strategies can generate or ameliorate injustices. We first examine how climate science and social justice interact within and among countries. We then ask what there is to learn from the available evidence on how emissions reductions, well-being, and equity have unfolded in a set of countries. Finally, we discuss the intersection between emissions reduction and mitigation justice through actions in important domains including energy, technology, transport, and food systems; nature-based solutions; and policy and governance.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2411231122","doi":"10.1073/pnas.2411231122","journal_full":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","dist":0.3157,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Convergence and consensus","authors":"H.

However, we argue that unions’ position on welfare state reforms will be affected by insiders and outsiders, depending on their level of membership and activity within the union. We combine macro-level data (content analysis of press releases) on six different unions in Germany with individual-level data (German Internet Panel), including information regarding differently skilled insider and outsider. We use a mix-method approach, and the results show that the attitudes of the low-skilled insiders (blue-collar workers) and low-skilled outsiders (low service functionaries) play a significant role in shaping unions’ positions. Both groups exhibit a high level of union membership and activity within unions. We conclude that this represents an important mechanism for understanding the influence of insiders and outsiders on unions’ position towards welfare state reforms.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf024","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf024","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.5003,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Should social insurance programs count as wealth? Augmented wealth in research and policy","authors":"Robert Manduca","abstract":"Research on wealth and wealth inequality is hindered by lack of consensus on a fundamental question: what counts as wealth? Scholars disagree on whether net worth should encompass only marketable assets or also include non-marketable “augmented wealth,” such as pensions and social insurance programs. Because augmented wealth often exceeds marketable wealth in total value and is much more equitably distributed, definitional choices shape even the most basic conclusions of empirical wealth research. This article advocates for use-specific wealth definitions, recommending that researchers first identify the use(s) for wealth of interest in a given study, then include all assets available for those uses, whether marketable or not. Case studies of Norway and the United States demonstrate the importance of augmented wealth—beyond pensions alone—across the wealth distribution, while a cross national analysis shows that differences in augmented wealth can help resolve the puzzling lack of correlation between income and (marketable) wealth inequality across countries.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwaf020","doi":"10.1093/ser/mwaf020","journal_full":"Socio-Economic Review","dist":0.4285,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The kids are Alt right?

However, most research conceptualizes AI as a form of specialized decision support tool. In contrast, this study presents a different form of human-AI collaboration, the concept of human-AI ensembles, where public managers and AI tackle the same decision tasks, rather than specializing in certain subtasks. This is particularly relevant for many public sector decisions, where neither human nor AI predictions have a clear advantage over the other. We illustrate this within the context of public hiring, focusing on two key areas: (a) the potential of ensembling human and AI to reduce biases and (b) the willingness of public managers to implement ensembling. Study 1 uses data from the assessment of profiles of real-life job candidates (n = 695) at the intersection of gender and ethnicity by public managers compared to AI. The exploratory OLS regression results illustrate how ensembled decision-making may alleviate ethnic biases. The OLS regression results of study 2, a pre-registered survey experiment, show that public managers (n = 538 with 4 observations each) put equal weight on AI advice and human advice, and, when reminded of the unlawfulness of hiring discrimination, may even prioritize AI over human advice.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1093/jopart/muaf009","doi":"10.1093/jopart/muaf009","journal_full":"Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory","dist":0.448,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"The post-oil post-COVID social contract: taxing informal workers for healthcare insurance in oil-exporting developing economies","authors":"Tom Moerenhout, Nicolas Orgeira Pillai, Joonseok Yang","abstract":"To improve health coverage and revenue collection, several African countries consider tax-for-health-services programs where informal workers pay income tax for health insurance.

This article draws on 120 interviews with four groups of workers who confront temporal and spatial instability: Texas-based agricultural and oilfield workers and NYC-based adjunct instructors and delivery workers. I find that rather than adopting one dominant individualizing story, as previous research suggests, workers instead move between what I call positioning stories : narratives that interpret their work’s particular structural features. In doing so, workers combine individualistic and structural frames to cope with their positional uncertainty. Depending on the specific tempo and geography of their work, workers account for spatial instability in stories about sacrifice and self-improvement; they interpret temporal instability in stories about addiction and the burden of time passing without progress. Workers combine these with stories highlighting meaning and exploitation in their labor process. These findings reveal how structural precarity impedes a cohesive narrative by disrupting identities and life projects, but it also undermines the credibility of individualistic accounts.

In this study, we examine how respondents belonging to the majority group react to information about demographic shifts, and how these shifts affect group boundaries using a survey experiment in Germany. Our results show that exposure to information about either a growing number of immigrants in general or specifically Muslims increases perceptions of threat among majority group members. This leads them to more frequently categorize individuals with ambiguous German / Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) features as likely having a migration background, particularly when the information specifically highlights the demographic increase of the Muslim population. However, the contraction of the group boundary in response to this information is modest. Further, the perceived status threat associated with demographic shifts leads to an increase in negative sentiments towards individuals perceived to have MENA physical characteristics.

Existing experimental research has struggled to distinguish these two channels. In a nationwide field experiment in Switzerland (paired applications to over 5,700 proprietors), we find evidence of discrimination against apartment seekers with Turkish and Kosovar names (i.e. distant minorities) while individuals with names from neighbouring countries (i.e. close minorities) are not discriminated against. Requests with more information generally receive more invitations, but the effect of this increased invitation rate is similar across minority groups. We find that adding more information does not reduce discrimination as such, as many previous studies have been claiming, but that the kind of information provided matters: while offering additional information about employment status reduces discrimination for individuals with Kosovar and Turkish names, signalling naturalisation does not lead to less discrimination.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso_a_00034","doi":"10.1162/euso_a_00034","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.6311,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Increasing Work Intensity to Improve Economic Well-being. An Analysis Across European Countries","authors":"Claudia Colombarolli","abstract":"This paper examines the impact of year-to-year increases in work intensity on economic well-being across European countries. Work intensity may rise through an increased number of months worked or the exit of dependent adult children. This study examines the differences between these two mechanisms. Both objective and subjective economic well-being are considered, namely, income levels and perceived ability to make ends meet. The analysis draws on 2010-2019 EU-SILC longitudinal data, focusing on individuals in households with adult children. It shows that, as work intensity increases from one year to the next, improvements in objective economic well-being are generally greater than those in subjective economic well-being. Both mechanisms are found to be relevant in improving income levels, especially if they occur simultaneously. The exit of dependent adult children proves effective in improving the perceived ability to make ends meet in some countries, but not all. Investing in quality employment could thus offer dual advantages, supporting young adults' transition to adulthood and improving their parents' economic well-being. In Southern European countries, households struggle to boost their work intensity from one year to the next, yet increased work intensity has a substantial impact on improving economic well-being there.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1162/euso_a_00037","doi":"10.1162/euso_a_00037","journal_full":"European Societies","dist":0.5261,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Sociotechnical imaginaries of social inequality in the design and use of AI recruitment technology","authors":"Laura Sartori, Clementine Collett","abstract":"Through interviewing 12 companies in Italy which either design (vendors) or use (clients) AI recruitment technology systems, we explore how these companies perceive their systems to interact with issues of social inequality and how these perceptions, in practice, carry societal impacts. Three sociotechnical imaginaries (Jasanoff and Kim, 2015) were consistently embedded within these companies’ visions of this intersection: the third eye, the river, and the car bonnet. Through critically analysing these imaginaries, we find that they exhibit an overriding desire for productivity and talent capture from clients, and a consequential de-prioritisation of addressing social inequality and scrutinising the ways it could be reproduced from both vendors and clients. It demonstrates that the current ‘desired’ futures, shown by the sociotechnical imaginaries which vendors and clients share for AI-tec-tech are really leading us towards an ‘undesirable’ future of hiring which continues to perpetuate social inequality.

Instruction-tuning the latest generative LLMs expands the scope of text classification, enabling applications to more complex tasks than previously feasible.

We argue that LLM predictions should be treated as potentially informative observations, while human subjects serve as a gold standard in a mixed subjects design . This paradigm preserves validity and offers more precise estimates at a lower cost than experiments relying exclusively on human subjects. We demonstrate—and extend—prediction-powered inference (PPI), a method that combines predictions and observations.

Empirical investigations of individual mobility effects, however, have been hindered by one fundamental limitation, the unidentifiability of mobility effects when origin and destination are held constant. Given this fundamental limitation, we propose to reconceptualize mobility effects from the micro- to macro-level. Instead of micro-level mobility effects, the primary focus of the past literature, we ask alternative research questions about macro-level mobility effects: What happens to the population distribution of an outcome if we manipulate the mobility regime, that is, if we alter the observed association between social origin and social destination? We relate individual-level mobility experience to macro-level mobility effects under special interventions. The proposed method bridges the macro and micro agendas in social stratification research, and has wider applications in social stratification beyond the study of mobility effects. We illustrate the method with two analyses that evaluate the impact of social mobility on average fertility and income inequality in the United States.

Yet, social network research generally conceptualizes identities as sociodemographic categories and seldom considers the inherently continuous and heterogeneous nature of differences. Drawing upon the infracategorical model of inequality, this study demonstrates that a computational approach – combining machine learning and exponential random graph models (ERGMs) – can capture the role of categorical conformity in network structures. Through a case study of gender segregation in friendships, this study presents a workflow for developing a machine-learning-based gender conformity measure and applying it to guide the social network analysis of cultural matching. Results show that adolescents with similar gender conformity are more likely to form friendships, net of homophily based on categorical gender and other controls, and homophily by gender conformity mediates homophily by categorical gender. The study concludes by discussing the limitations of this computational approach and its unique strengths in enhancing theories on categories, boundaries, and stratification.","url":"https://doi.org/10.1177/00491241251321152","doi":"10.1177/00491241251321152","journal_full":"Sociological Methods & Research","dist":0.4905,"specialized":false,"preprint":false},{"title":"Correcting the Measurement Errors of AI-Assisted Labeling in Image Analysis Using Design-Based Supervised Learning","authors":"Alessandra Rister Portinari Maranca, Jihoon Chung, Musashi Hinck, Adam D.

Yet three barriers still stand in the way: the tedious labor of manual text annotation, the technical complexity that keeps these tools out of reach for many researchers, and, perhaps most critically, the challenge of bridging the gap between sophisticated algorithms and the deep theoretical understanding social scientists have already developed about human interactions, social structures, and institutions. To counter these limitations, we propose an approach to large-scale text analysis that requires substantially less human-labeled data, and no machine learning expertise, and efficiently integrates the social scientist into critical steps in the workflow. This approach, which allows the detection of statements in text, relies on large language models pre-trained for natural language inference, and a “few-shot” threshold-tuning algorithm rooted in active learning principles.

Moving from more to less job concept detail, we find almost no inference differences when pay gaps are estimated at the organizational level. Tradeoffs at the workplace and job groups within workplace levels are more common, comprising around 10 percent to 20 percent of observations.

However, commodity prices are increasingly determined through trading in futures markets. Historically, most commodity benchmarks were traded on futures exchanges in New York, Chicago and London (infrastructure), dominated by Anglo-American financial institutions (investor), USD-denominated (currency), and supervised by US/UK regulators (regulatory). The article develops the concept of (commodity) pricing power as resulting from a combination of these different sources of power which further solidifies US financial hegemony, while putting China into a subordinate position. It thus provides a novel perspective for understanding the politics of commodities, global finance and China’s role therein. Based on policy documents, financial data and 200 expert interviews, the paper explores China’s efforts for establishing its own commodity benchmarks, tracing how (a lack of) commodity pricing power emerged as a problem for Chinese authorities and was subsequently pursued as a national development strategy for gaining more autonomy from US-dominated markets. While we often perceive China as a powerful actor, the paper illustrates how the market-based, financialised setup of international economic affairs can fundamentally constrain China’s global influence, even placing it into a position of profound vulnerability.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9nwga_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/9nwga_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3668,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Speed-Quality Tradeoffs Shape the Structure of Decision-Making Collectives","authors":"Chanuwas Aswamenakul, Paul E.

A common explanation for the prevalence of hierarchical decision-making is that it provides group-level benefits by speeding up the decision-making process. However, groups can often do better by taking more time to explore a problem space or generate ideas. These contrasting accounts suggest that hierarchical or egalitarian decision structures may emerge under different circumstances. To more clearly distinguish between these circumstances, we studied an evolutionary model of group decision-making that includes both intra-group and inter-group dynamics. We show that the emergent social structure depends critically on the trade-off between speed and decision quality: scenarios that demand rapid decisions favor the evolution of skewed, hierarchical structures, while scenarios that reward extended deliberation favor the evolution of flat, egalitarian structures. Our results suggest that, instead of inevitably becoming centralized and hierarchical, groups and organizations are likely to evolve social structures that reflect the relationship between the speed and the quality of decisions they collectively make.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxew4_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/bxew4_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4023,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Supplying Influence: Domestic Production Networks in Trade Politics","authors":"Timm Betz, Leonhard Hummel","abstract":"Why are some firms more successful than others in obtaining privileged treatment from their government? Trade policy, as an unusually targeted redistributive tool, offers a rich context to understand such questions of special interest politics and corporate power.

We argue that firms with more linkages throughout the domestic economy enjoy a privileged political position. Benefits to these firms extend indirectly to a broader set of constituents, which allows firms to assemble broader coalitions and to portray protectionist policy as more than purely particularistic politics. We provide evidence for this argument by developing original measures of linkages between firms, derived from over 600,000 customer-supplier relationships among industries, matching them with data on anti-dumping petitions filed by U.S. firms, written briefs filed by Members of Congress on behalf of these firms, and the geographic distribution of industries. Our account identifies a new explanation of differences in the political influence of firms, underscores the relevance of domestic production networks in politics, and offers a new perspective on cleavages and coalitions in trade politics. Our results also suggest that the expansion of global supply chains, long considered a hallmark of political power, may have weakened the political clout of some of the largest firms by limiting their domestic footprint.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m76kj_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/m76kj_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5348,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Quantifying the Rise in Anti-Vaccine Policymaking Across State Legislatures Through the State Vaccine Policy Project (SVPP).","authors":"Matthew Motta, Timothy Callaghan","abstract":"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers across the US have introduced legislation aimed at weakening existing vaccine-related policies (e.g., vaccine mandates in employment or educational settings).

Using a two-wave panel survey conducted before and after the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we show that partisan alignment strongly shapes inflation expectations. Democrats reported heightened inflation expectations, anticipating inflationary policies under a Trump administration, while Republicans expected inflation to fall. These shifts reflect partisan interpretations of economic policy rather than objective forecasts. We also analyze the characteristics of those who are more likely to update inflation expectations and in what direction. Importantly, we verify that individuals with strong partisan attitudes exhibit less anchored inflation expectations. Our findings have implications beyond the case under analysis. From a policy perspective, our results underscore the challenges central banks face in anchoring inflation expectations in an era of political polarization, where economic perceptions differ sharply across partisanship lines.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qtg8r_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/qtg8r_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4992,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The influence of public policy and administration expertise on policy: An empirical study","authors":"Robin Haunschild, Kate Williams, Lutz Bornmann","abstract":"Academic expertise is a key pillar of governance processes around the world.

We use Finnish total population register data on cohorts born between 1977 and 1980 and follow individuals from the age of 18 to 39. We estimate discrete-time event history models for the annual likelihood of having a child for men and women, with MHDs, co-residential partnership, and the partner’s MHDs as the main explanatory variables. We measure MHD by using both diagnose information (ICD-10 codes) from the special health care registers and medication information (ATC-codes). All types of MHDs predicted lower likelihood of having a child, the annual probability being 0.8–1.3%-points lower for women and 1.0–1.8 %-points for men in age-controlled models. The strongest association was observed for severe mental disorders. Co-residential partnerships explained part of the difference between those with and without MHD (for any MHD 13% for women and 36% for men compared to age-controlled model). When both partners have an MHD, the likelihood for childlessness was higher compared to partners where only one of the partners had an MHD. We conclude that partnerships and partner’s mental health are important factors in explaining the relationship between mental health disorders and childlessness, particularly among men.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/325v9_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/325v9_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3958,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Encampments as neighbors: Amenity access and encampment choice among Seattle, WA’s unhoused population","authors":"Aja Sutton, Whitney Walker, Amy Hagopian, Zack W.

This “school profiling” is thought to drive school segregation by socio-economic status (SES). However, since most existing research has focused on U.S. charter schools and lacks large-scale student-level data, the connection between profiling and SES-based school sorting remains unclear. This study addresses this gap by focusing on the case of the Netherlands, a country known for its high school autonomy and freedom of school choice. I use population-wide register data from over 110,000 students (aged 11–12), linked to novel data on school profiling. The findings reveal social stratification in access to schools with distinctive profiles, with higher SES students having access to a more diverse pool of schools. Furthermore, conditional logit models show evidence of self-sorting by SES for some profiles: for instance, schools with progressive learning concepts are less popular among lower SES students, while higher SES students are comparatively less likely to choose labor market-themed schools. These SES disparities, however, are modest and not always in the expected direction. Overall, findings underscore the role of access disparities in shaping SES-based sorting, next to differential preferences for schooling.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/68cbq_v2","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/68cbq_v2","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5424,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"The motherhood penalty on poverty risk within couples in Germany","authors":"Christina Siegert","abstract":"This paper examines how the transition to parenthood affects the gender-specific poverty risk within couples, highlighting the persistent economic vulnerability of partnered mothers in Germany.

While the average household poverty risk remains low and stable around childbirth, the average individual poverty risk for women rises sharply, peaking at 59% one year after childbirth and persisting at a high level up to five years later, indicating a motherhood penalty relative to their partners and childless women. Analyses by year of first birth show a declining yet persistent motherhood penalty on women’s poverty risk for younger cohorts.

Longer family leave has been shown to weaken women’s labour market positions and some studies have found heterogenous effects across population groups. However, whether the effect differs by partnership status remains unexplored. Using Finnish register data from 1989 to 2014 (ca. 2.5 million person-years) and controlling for selection into single motherhood by comparing estimates from OLS and FE models, this study compares single and patnered mothers’ unemployment and earnings consequent to extended family leaves. In line with predictions that single mothers may face greater work-family reconciliation issues or cumulative disadvantage leading to greater labour market penalties, the results showed that longer leave increases the length of unemployment for single mothers more than for partnered ones. This is not solely because of selection into single motherhood. Earnings penalties after family leave (net of employment status) are the same for single and partnered mothers. We conclude that similar long- lengths of family leave are penalised more among single mothers in terms of employment, which increases and reproduces social inequalities. This means that existing inequalities are reinforced by labour market absences supported by leave policies.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gbjt5_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/gbjt5_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4557,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Weaponizing Kinship: A Demographic Analysis of Bereavement in the Colombian Conflict","authors":"Enrique Acosta, Diego Alburez-Gutierrez, Maria Gargiulo, Catalina Torres","abstract":"The Colombian Armed Conflict produced extensive patterns of homicide and enforced disappearance as armed actors employed strategies of terror to assert and consolidate power. Yet family bereavement—one of the most widespread and enduring consequences of such violence—remains critically understudied from a quantitative perspective. This study applies kinship demographic methods to estimate the scale of conflict-attributable bereavement in Colombia across time, with a focus on its population-level prevalence. Using data from the Colombian Truth Commission, adjusted for underreporting, we estimate the number of individuals who have ever experienced the death or enforced disappearance of family members due to conflict-related violence. Results indicate that, by 2018, approximately 7% of Colombians had lost a close family member, while 38% had lost any member of their family. Demographic projections suggest that these effects will persist for decades. The study provides novel insight into the scale, structure, and long-term consequences of kin loss caused by armed conflict. In the Colombian context, it represents a first step toward recognizing that war-induced bereavement was not merely collateral, but a targeted mechanism for dismantling family networks and eroding community cohesion. Our demographic profiling of the bereaved can aid efforts to support survivors and identify victims of enforced disappearance.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p87aw_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/p87aw_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.4936,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"A gender gap in happiness: Documenting a puzzle from Indian survey data","authors":"Diane Coffey, Yiwen Wang, Aashish Gupta","abstract":"Happiness studies from around the world find that women report greater happiness than men. Few studies investigate this gap in India, where there are important gender disparities in social, educational, economic, and health outcomes. We use WHO SAGE 2007-08 data to document gaps in self-reported happiness between men and women in middle and later adulthood. We find that women are 5 percentage points more likely to report being “very happy” or “happy” compared to men (0.60 vs. 0.55, p&lt;0.01). We use descriptive figures and regression models to show that the gender gap in reported happiness increases after adjusting for differences in education, self-reported physical health, and paid employment. The fact these covariates correlate with happiness in the expected ways increases the credibility of the data and sharpens the puzzle. This study contributes the most comprehensive documentation to date of the gender gap in reported happiness in India.

Despite having declared “functionalism” to be obsolete, some form of functionalist argument remains cryptically present in much substantive research. We argue that the inability to talk plainly about functions is a major hindrance for theory building in the discipline. As such, this paper has two goals. The first is disambiguation. What does it mean to attribute a function to something? We answer this question by elaborating on the distinction between proper functions (responding to why-is-it-there questions) and role functions (responding to how-does-it-work questions). The second is to introduce a typology of functional arguments that builds upon this distinction, allowing us to recast “functionalism” as a set of general explanatory strategies and not as a substantive theory about society. Importantly, these strategies are not burdened by the problems of the organicist framework many sociologists have in mind when they disregard functionalist explanations.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dfc4k_v4","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/dfc4k_v4","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3315,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Asian American Fertility: Differences by Education and Marital Status","authors":"Kate H.

Background: By 2055, Asian Americans will become the largest immigrant group in the United States. The fertility behavior of Asian American women will have significant implications for the future size and composition of the US population. Yet, due to data constraints, little is known about Asian American fertility. Method: This paper analyzes data from the 2022─2023 American Community Survey to compare the odds of having a child in the past year by women’s race/ethnicity, education, and marital status. Results: Fertility differences between Asian American women and those in other racial/ethnic groups were primarily due to differences in non-marital fertility rates. For unmarried women in all groups, having a college degree was associated with lower adjusted odds of having a child during the past 12 months. However, this educational differential was largest among Asian American women. Having a college degree was associated with higher adjusted odds of having a birth for married White, Black, and Hispanic women. Educational differences were minimal among married Asian American women. Conclusion: Asian American women with college degrees display a stronger preference for marriage as the context for childbearing than women in other racial/ethnic and educational groups.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fus63_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/fus63_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.5054,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"A Cognitive Sociological Account to the Emergence of Novel Worlds","authors":"Michael Hannan, Giacomo Negro","abstract":"This paper proposes a cognitive sociological account of the emergence of social worlds that organize the expectations of producers and audiences. The proposed model considers the emergence process in three stages. The first stage concerns the arrival of distinctive clusters of objects and their producers. The second involves the conceptualization of the labeled clusters within high-energy social structures that we call scenes. The final stage occurs if and when the concept at the center of the scene becomes generally taken for granted. The first part of the paper develops an ontology for analyzing these processes. The second part analyzes the role of social structure in these stages and defines the emergence process in terms of hazards, the event rates of each stage, which can be modeled in empirical analysis. The proposed account can explain the emergence of worlds in a variety of social contexts, including organizational forms in markets, genres in creative industries, disciplines in science, and forms of social protest.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gnek3_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/gnek3_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.3885,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"Deportations and Latino Segregation: The Residential Impacts of Interior Immigration Enforcement","authors":"Matthew Hall, Jacob S.

This study examines the effects of 287(g) agreements, which empower local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws, on Latino residential segregation. Using a quasi-experimental design that compares counties implementing 287(g) with those that applied but did not implement, we find that these policies significantly slowed declines in Hispanic-white segregation, particularly in early-adopting Southern counties where enforcement was most aggressive. We find no evidence that the program altered patterns of segregation for non-Hispanics. Our analysis suggests that these effects are driven by shifts in residential mobility and migration behaviors among Latino households, as enforcement amplified economic vulnerability, fear, and spatial isolation. By demonstrating how immigration enforcement disrupts Latino integration into residential communities, this study reveals the far-reaching consequences of these policies for racial stratification and neighborhood inequality in the United States.","url":"https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s9ztx_v1","doi":"10.31235/osf.io/s9ztx_v1","journal_full":"(OSF Preprints)","dist":0.6717,"specialized":false,"preprint":true},{"title":"University Journals: A Semi-Systematic Literature Review of Trends, Challenges, and Future Research Directions","authors":"Maryna Nazarovets","abstract":"University journals (UJs), understood as scholarly journals published by or associated with universities, play an essential role in the dissemination of academic knowledge, serving as a vital platform for scholarly communication.

It has revealed that much of it was already broken. This paper argues that the dominant educational paradigm, rooted in formalist models of cognition, no longer serves the needs of a world filled with thinking machines. Learning, long reduced to internal recall and reproduction, must be recalibrated as the capacity to act meaningfully, critically, and creatively with tools in real-world contexts. This is not technological determinism. It’s an attempt to reconcile epistemic insolvency accruing compounding interest. Blending epistemological insight with systems-level critique and practical strategies, the paper exposes the reactive militarization between student evasion and faculty surveillance, and it challenges educators to transform traditional classroom activities with authentic, tool-mediated practice. Drawing from the fields of Learning Sciences and Instructional Design, it explores how GenAI can serve not as a threat to integrity, but as a compounding cognitive artifact: a “thought prosthesis,” a support system that amplifies creativity, an accessibility tool, and an enabler of personalized, real-time learning at scale. The paper proposes a Critical AI Literacy agenda grounded in epistemic awareness. This extends to include practical implementation of RAG tutors, Custom GPTs, interactive generators, student-led content production, and code-based learning; all deployed with an honest reckoning of GenAI’s deficits: semiotic fallacy, fabrication, bias, and ethical opacity. The result is a roadmap not only for responsible integration of GenAI in college classrooms, but for reimagining what education can become when human discernment, creativity, and tool fluency are placed at the center.
