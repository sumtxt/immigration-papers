To ground a robust engagement with diasporas and their normative challenges, we expand on current transnationalism literature to offer a non‐statist framework of political community. This framework is necessary as the diaspora is a transnational community that shares overlapping narratives and practices but lacks unified institutional structures and objectives. Tracking these features, we posit that individuals constitute a diasporic community by expressing, through their practices and narratives, a joint meta‐commitment to act as part of that community. Meta‐commitments do not require the parties to have substantial agreements beyond mutually recognizing each other as acting on behalf of the same community. The diasporic meta‐commitment grounds an obligation of answerability: Diasporic members owe each other an answer as to how their choices relate to the future of the diaspora.

Ethnicity-based insurance operates through reciprocity and solidarity, requiring social investment in in-group ties. This limits the formation of out-group ties, exacerbating ethnic divisions. Welfare reduces dependence on the ethnic group, allowing individuals to form productive out-group ties and increasing intergroup integration. I test this argument in caste networks in India.

Despite these worries, the literature on how negativity in voting affects democratic attitudes and voting intentions is riddled with ambiguous and contradictory results. We argue that this may partly be due to the failure to distinguish between two types of negativity in voting: (a) understanding voting as a way to act against a specific party, politician, or policy (negative meanings of voting), and (b) opposition to voting itself (an anti-voting orientation). Contrasting these to the classical conception of voting to support a party, politician, or policy (positive meanings of voting), we conceptualize these constructs and validate their measurement in twelve countries, differing in geography, political systems, and levels of democracy ( N = 23,828). We arrive at two main conclusions. First, positive and negative meanings of voting are complementary and compatible attitudes. Modeling positive and negative voting separately rather than relative to each other shows a more nuanced picture of negative voting than previous work. Second, negative voting and anti-voting orientation are distinct types of negativity that relate differently to classical conceptions of voting and democratic attitudes. The first signals political dissatisfaction but belief in the electoral process. The second corresponds to such a disillusionment about voting that it inhibits dissatisfaction with democracy.

Using data from the 2014 and 2019 waves of the European Election Study, covering 29 European democracies, I analyse differences across the left-right spectrum, economic attitudes (ie redistribution, regulation, spending), social attitudes (ie immigration, same-sex marriage, environment, and civil liberties), and views on European integration. The results reveal some disparities between voters and non-voters, but these are generally sporadic, even within individual countries, suggesting that such disparities are not the norm. Still, when differences do arise, they are not trivial. The analysis of how the electorate’s preferences would change under a hypothetical full turnout scenario suggests that these disparities can introduce meaningful biases. Using data from the British Election Study Internet Panel, I further distinguish between regular voters, peripheral voters, and perpetual non-voters and find notable heterogeneity in their policy preferences. These findings show that when turnout is low, the electorate’s overall stance reflects that of regular voters, but higher turnout mitigates this bias.

This is reflected across three dimensions of dollar dominance: in trade and payments, as reserve currency and safe asset, and as global investment and funding currency. What distinguishes the current moment from previous predictions of a decline of financial hegemony is that the dollar’s global role is now challenged across all three dimensions simultaneously. Following the Global Financial Crisis, growing uneasiness with US financial power, especially the use of financial sanctions, already created cracks at the margins of the system and prompted a search for alternatives, triggering partial reserve diversification and de-dollarization of trade and payments systems. Under Trump, the undermining of the global economic order, growing fiscal deficits, and continued attacks on the institutional foundations of the administrative state are fundamentally undermining trust in the United States that is fundamental for the dollar’s global role. This signals a rupture in the US-centric global financial system, altering the foundations of the rules-based liberal international order (LIO).

Authoritarian regimes are no longer merely resisting pressure; they are reshaping the system itself. Four strategies are driving this transformation: repression of domestic and transnational activism; refuting information and discrediting of critics; re-engineering procedures and coalitions within international organizations; and replacement of existing norms with alternative narratives that redefine human rights in illiberal terms. US disengagement amplifies each strategy by removing funding, normative leadership, and institutional backing that once raised the cost of violations and constrained authoritarian advance. Together, these developments mark a turning point. Where autocracies once played defense, liberal democracies and human rights actors are now on the defensive. If powerful authoritarian states consolidate these gains, they may emerge as models for others, attract new followers, and gravely damage liberal human rights as a global project.

A US government unbound by domestic constraint will have difficulty building broad coalitions to solve national and international problems because it will have reduced incentives to invest in public goods, including national defense, science and technology, and future economic prosperity; reduced barriers to corruption that undermines the quality of and trust in US capabilities; and reduced state capacity, including the capacity to finance wars and other long-term international commitments. We argue that three trends were especially relevant in reshaping domestic audience constraint: information fragmentation, extreme polarization, and a global threat environment that facilitated executive power concentration. Together they reduce the costs and risks for leaders to escape domestic audience constraints, weakening the institutional and accountability mechanisms that give democracies advantages in the international system. Though these trends affect many democracies, the undermining of US domestic constraint is particularly consequential because the United States shaped and buttressed the current system. An unconstrained United States likely means a less cooperative and less predictable global order, irrevocably altering the post-1945 system.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0020818325101161", "doi": "10.1017/s0020818325101161", "journal_full": "International Organization", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008612722976365839}, {"title": "The Future of Global Governance and World Order", "authors": "Brett Ashley Leeds, Layna Mosley, B.

This essay evaluates the theories and evidence that speak to this question.

According to an influential narrative in scholarship and public debate, this “territorial integrity norm” is a product of the post-World War II international order and contrasts with the nineteenth century, when conquest was normalized and “might made right.” This essay argues, however, that nineteenth-century European international law imposed meaningful limitations on conquest, including “territorial inviolability.” These limitations were more effective in the colonized world than in Europe, primarily because national irredentism was not thought relevant outside Europe. Europeans’ denial of non-European sovereignty contrasted with their respect for European-established colonial boundaries, and they did not fight over colonial territory between 1815 and 1914. I demonstrate the strength of this “etiquette of thieves” by examining two events where territorial conflict between colonial powers was narrowly avoided: the Panjdeh (1885) and Fashoda (1898) incidents. Viewing territorial integrity as qualitatively changing, rather than absent at one time and present later, has important implications for discussions of how recent conquests, such as those of Russia in Ukraine, will affect the principle of territorial integrity. In particular, territorial integrity may be more likely to be altered in how it is applied than eroded altogether. A specific form of territorial integrity is an integral part of the post-World War II international order, but constraints on conquest as such need not be limited to that specific version of territorial integrity.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0020818325101124", "doi": "10.1017/s0020818325101124", "journal_full": "International Organization", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0349508117559284}, {"title": "Further Back to the Future: Neo-Royalism, the Trump Administration, and the Emerging International System", "authors": "Stacie E.

The actions of the Trump administration, however, raise a number of significant puzzles for such accounts—the US seems willing to sign deals with traditional adversaries including Russia and China, while targeting long-standing allies like Canada and Denmark. At the same time, transactional politics often serve narrow personalist interests rather than national objectives. In short, a Westphalian lens focused on states and sovereignty may generate intellectual blinders that misreads the emerging international order. To overcome these limitations, we propose an alternative account, which we label neo-royalism. The neo-royalist order centers on an international system structured by a small group of hyper elites, which we term cliques. Such cliques seek to legitimize their authority through appeals to their exceptionalism in order to generate durable material and status hierarchies based on the extraction of financial and cultural tributes. This short paper lays out the key elements of the neo-royalist order, differentiating it from the Westphalian and Liberal International Orders, and applies its insights to better grapple with the emerging system being promoted by the United States under Donald J. Trump. For policymakers and scholars, the neo-royalist approach clarifies recent events in US foreign policy.

Drawing on the concepts of institutional drift and legal substitution, the essay shows how states recalibrate their obligations without renouncing them, preserving the appearance of compliance while limiting access to asylum. These practices form a broader architecture of containment, characterized by border externalization, procedural delays, and institutional delegation. What emerges is not the collapse of the refugee regime but its reconfiguration around a postliberal logic that prioritizes sovereignty, discretion, and risk management over multilateralism and rights enforcement. By tracing this shift across legal frameworks and policy instruments, the essay contributes to debates on norm erosion, soft law, and the future of international cooperation.

A handful of companies operate beyond the reach of domestic regulation and multilateral oversight, controlling access to technologies that create vulnerabilities existing institutions struggle to contain.

In the post–World War II era, clear myths emerged around the ordering of the world, placing democracy, order, and peace at the idealized heart of global governance.

Myths traditionally change with institutions. At this unique inflection point in the 2020s, however, this is no longer the case—myths crumble while the institutions they once supported persist, creating a vacuum in which novel myths must emerge in what we refer to as the new age of myth. We argue that the global order is in a transitional moment in terms of its governing mythologies. The myths that are born out of this age will underline the institutions, ideas, and ideologies that will shape the trajectory of the international order in the coming decades.

In this essay we review these benefits and another that has been overlooked: ally-enabled access. Access refers to permission from allies and partners to engage in military and intelligence missions within their borders on their territory, through their airspace, or in their territorial waters. Access via America’s allies and security partners has enabled Washington to use foreign sovereign spaces for military logistics, military operations, and foreign surveillance to overcome the tyranny of distance. Examples include permission from allies and partners in the Middle East to allow the US Air Force to fly from their bases to strike targets in Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11, and US intelligence installations built and operated by permission from Pakistani, Turkish, and Japanese territory during the Cold War. We describe the broad functions of alliances and show how access has been key to projection of American military and intelligence power at a global scale. Perhaps limiting or ending America’s global hegemonic role is desirable; perhaps it is dangerous.

It argues that as the military expands its role in the economy, it gains both the incentives and opportunities to stage coups. However, this effect varies by rank. Military-run enterprises function as a double-edged sword: while they provide rent-seeking opportunities that reduce the likelihood of rebellion among mid- and low-ranking officers, they also embolden senior officers, for whom economic control becomes a political stake. Leaders may use economic privileges to co-opt mid and lower ranking officers, but as military builds more economic capital, senior officers become less dependent on civilian leadership and more likely to stage coups.

The extent of an ideological belief is explained by a direct and immediate function of its indoctrination capacities. The paper does not question this top–down, macro–micro approach, but argues that the spread of an ideology also depends on stabilizing micro–micro interactions and micro–macro linkages. In this light, the paper makes use of James Coleman’s famous explanatory model and theorizes the different partial mechanisms. It pays particular emphasis on the micro–macro mechanism. Borrowing insights from epidemiology, it argues that three classes of parameters should be taken into closer consideration: timing, contact structure, and the contagiousness of an ideology. In empirical terms, the paper illustrates its theoretical reasoning with the dissemination of the North Korean Juche ideology from the 1950s to the early 1970s, which represents an extreme case of a rapidly ideologizing autocracy. The paper relies on secondary sources as well as archival material retrieved from the former embassy of the German Democratic Republic in Pyongyang.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725102296", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725102296", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011450235166155842}, {"title": "Status, States, and Moral Sentiments: How Respect and Disrespect Shape International Politics.

Using Antitrust Reform to Understand Expert–Public Cleavages", "authors": "Nicholas Short, Sophie Hill, Jacob Brown", "abstract": "Scholarship on regulatory capture—when businesses lobby regulators to act contrary to the public interest—has thrived since the 1970s. Yet it ignores an important dimension of influence, what we call ideological capture. This occurs when experts design regulatory frameworks that marginalize important public values and produce favorable outcomes for special interests even in the absence of lobbying. We present a theoretical and empirical framework for understanding ideological capture, rooted in expert–public cleavages, and measure its presence in an important policy domain (antitrust review of business mergers) with an original survey of the public and of antitrust lawyers. Our results suggest that the main framework for evaluating anticompetitive conduct, the consumer welfare standard, marginalizes important public concerns but is deeply popular among antitrust lawyers.

I draw on Foucault, because he illuminates the vital role of monopoly in the transition from liberalism to neoliberalism and provides a conceptual framework that allows us to understand the debate between neoliberals and neoBrandeisians accurately as a dispute over the standards for making truth claims about markets. Whereas neoliberals developed a formal theory that promised to the excise the problem of monopoly from antitrust, neoBrandeisians draw on Progressive-era Legal Pragmatism to show how that project cannot stand up to jurisprudential or empirical scrutiny. NeoBrandeisians offer a meliorist alternative: although they concede the impossibility of fully ridding markets of monopoly, they show how a vigilant and adaptative antitrust regime can subdue market power sufficiently to serve prosperity, liberty, and democracy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s1537592725102788", "doi": "10.1017/s1537592725102788", "journal_full": "Perspectives on Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007900947919373125}, {"title": "Perfect Storm.

We fill this gap by focusing on a rare instance of expressive voting: support for the Italian Communist Party (PCI) in the 1984 European election, preceded by the sudden death of PCI’s leader, Enrico Berlinguer. Via a Regression Discontinuity approach, exploiting differential expressive motives along the border(s) of Berlinguer’s electoral district, we show that municipal-level support for PCI increased more sharply in 1984 in areas where voters could express their preference for the just-deceased leader.

During the last 125 years, twenty-eight states in the U.S. reduced the size of their juries, while three others allowed non-unanimous verdicts in felony and/or misdemeanor cases. Blackstonian ratios and burdens of proof exhibited similar variations across jurisdiction. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court cast a critical eye on non-unanimous juries and reintroduced the requirement of unanimity for all felony convictions. In 2023, jury size also received scrutiny from the U.S. Supreme Court, underscoring the enduring volatility of criminal jury practices in the United States. U.S. states currently have the authority to determine jury size, retrial rates, and the Blackstonian ratio applied within their jurisdictions. In this paper, we examine the critical interdependence of these changes in jury structure and their impact on the expected correctness of verdicts and on the decisiveness and accuracy of the jury process.

However, this underestimates the potentially meaningful role of personal experience in policy preferences as a potential counterweight to partisanship. A key limitation to testing this has been the absence of data with workers’ preferences and direct measures of working conditions. This study draws on original data on 5,425 service sector workers to examine the relationship between partisanship, direct experience with poor working conditions, and labor policy preferences. The results suggest that partisanship is an important determinant of labor policy preferences, but only when workers work in relatively good jobs. Among workers with good working conditions, partisanship is influential and Republicans and Democrats hold significantly different views on labor policy.

Through a social information processing lens, we argue that such introspections begin with relative perceptions of two basic traits: communion (prosocial intentionality) and agency (goal-pursuit capacities) for both machine and user. These relative perceptions are then interpreted through relational schemas in the short term and regulated by trust in the long term––jointly shaping relational behaviors toward the machine (e.g., intention to use). We surveyed three US samples of various AI-technology users (college students, N = 438; MTurk participants, N = 1,023; Prolific participants, N = 726, matched to census demographics). Results consistently showed that (a) intention to use such a machine was driven by self-agency followed by machine-communion, whereas machine-agency and self-communion had no direct impact, and (b) the relative importance of these trait perceptions was mediated by certain relational schemas and moderated by trust across respondents.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/hcr/hqaf026", "doi": "10.1093/hcr/hqaf026", "journal_full": "Human Communication Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0062266693082273505}, {"title": "Disentangling intent and behaviour: news avoidance and its implications for political knowledge", "authors": "Ludovic Terren, Ana Sofía Cardenal", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2025.2587136", "doi": "10.1080/1369118x.2025.2587136", "journal_full": "Information, Communication & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010713405423053879}, {"title": "A commercial playground: investigating TikTok influencers’ commercial content", "authors": "Mathilde Hogsnes, Tor-Morten Grønli", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2025.2588348", "doi": "10.1080/1369118x.2025.2588348", "journal_full": "Information, Communication & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01015703551327618}, {"title": "Eco-anxiety among young climate activists in the Netherlands: the role of information exposure on social media", "authors": "Marc Esteve-del-Valle, Klara Matusewicz", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2025.2587124", "doi": "10.1080/1369118x.2025.2587124", "journal_full": "Information, Communication & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.044526297936128056}, {"title": "Who feels influenced?

We introduced an inception-style manipulation where billboards initially overlooked by participants were covertly reintroduced based on real-time gaze tracking.

This study reveals a nuanced progression in Ethiopia’s media sphere using a mixed–methods approach, including semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and quantitative statistical analysis. The initial period showed promising developments, such as releasing imprisoned journalists and politicians and lifting website bans. However, these advancements proved temporary as authoritarian practices persisted. The government has modified legal frameworks, including media regulations, laws addressing disinformation and hate speech, and counterterrorism measures. These modifications appeared to reinforce government control rather than enhance media freedom. Journalists continue to face significant dangers, including arbitrary arrests, physical attacks, and forced flees. More than 54 journalists fled the country between 2018 and 2024, owing to threats and persecution. This pattern demonstrates that brief periods of optimism following leadership changes consistently follow authoritarian repression. The regression toward repression highlights deep-rooted challenges in Ethiopia’s political system and the difficulty of breaking established governance patterns. The government maintained strict control over the media environment, limiting freedom of expression and stifling opposition voices. This resulted in a highly regulated information landscape in which official narratives dominated the public discourse.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01634437251394988", "doi": "10.1177/01634437251394988", "journal_full": "Media, Culture & Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.04476009939402814}, {"title": "Flooding the Feed: The Politics of Social Media Sharing Among Defensive Publics", "authors": "Katharina Tittel, William Allen, Pedro Ramaciotti", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2025.2588248", "doi": "10.1080/10584609.2025.2588248", "journal_full": "Political Communication", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.012644761576704577}, {"title": "Impacts of the USDA broadband initiatives program on employment and telework: Evidence from confidential American community survey microdata", "authors": "Anil Rupasingha, John Pender, Robert Dinterman", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103102", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103102", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.029109275945036872}, {"title": "Broadband deployment and access to online banking: Does improved technology facilitate adoption?", "authors": "Joan Calzada, Alejandra Pablo", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103113", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103113", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.024611333913564737}, {"title": "The behavioral impact of 5G adoption: Evidence from individual-level transaction data", "authors": "Joseph Lee, Jae-Hyeon Ahn, Jaeho Myeong", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103112", "doi": "10.1016/j.telpol.2025.103112", "journal_full": "Telecommunications Policy", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01753460950424013}, {"title": "A scaling law for two-sided networks?

We characterize the conditions under which the traditional prescription—relying solely on the policy rate and exchange rate flexibility—remains sufficient, even in the presence of externalities. By contrast, to manage noise trader flows into and out of the local currency debt market, FX intervention and in some cases capital inflow taxes should be used instead of the traditional prescription. Moreover, if a country faces a mix of local currency premia and external borrowing constraints, we establish that certain regulations to limit FX mismatch may alleviate the external borrowing constraint but exacerbate the local currency premia. Finally, we show that capital controls may dominate domestic macroprudential measures in cases when external shocks trigger stress in domestic housing markets.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta21802", "doi": "10.3982/ecta21802", "journal_full": "Econometrica", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006905556984060257}, {"title": "Gangs, Labor Mobility, and Development", "authors": "Nikita Melnikov, Carlos Schmidt-Padilla, María Micaela Sviatschi", "abstract": "We study how criminal organizations affect economic development.

None of these discontinuities existed before the arrival of the gangs.

Such arrangements may distort labor supply—acting as a “social tax” that dampens the incentive to work. We document that across countries, from the United States to Côte d'Ivoire, low‐income groups report strong pressure to share earned income with others; in addition, social groups that undertake more interpersonal transfers work fewer hours. Using a field experiment, we enable piece‐rate factory workers in Côte d'Ivoire to shield income using blocked savings accounts over 9 months. Workers may only deposit earnings increases, relative to baseline, mitigating income effects on labor supply. Offering Private accounts raises work attendance by 6.5% and earnings by 9.4%. These treatment effects are concentrated among workers who report higher redistributive pressure at baseline. To obtain further suggestive evidence on mechanisms, in a supplementary experiment, we vary whether blocked accounts are private or known to the worker's network. When accounts are private, take‐up is substantively higher (60% vs. 14%), with a resultant 8.8% higher earnings. Outgoing transfers do not decline, indicating no loss in redistribution.

An endogenous switch from class to cultural identity accounts for three major changes: (i) growing cultural conflict between voters and parties; (ii) dampening of redistributive conflict, despite rising inequality; (iii) a realignment of lower class voters from the left to the right. The incentive of parties to spread stereotypes is a key driver of identity‐based polarization. Using survey data and congressional speeches, we show that—consistent with our model—there is evidence of (i) and (ii) in the voting realignment induced by the “China Shock” (Autor, Dorn, Hanson, and Majlesi (2020)).", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta22269", "doi": "10.3982/ecta22269", "journal_full": "Econometrica", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.022713247229367628}, {"title": "Marginal Reputation", "authors": "Daniel Luo, Alexander Wolitzky", "abstract": "We study reputation formation where a long‐run player repeatedly observes private signals and takes actions.

Nonetheless, we show that the long‐run player can secure her Stackelberg payoff if distinct commitment types are statistically distinguishable and the Stackelberg strategy is confound‐defeating . This property holds if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is the unique solution to an optimal transport problem. If the long‐run player's payoff is supermodular in one‐dimensional signals and actions, she secures the Stackelberg payoff if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is monotone.

Quantifying it typically requires estimating and extrapolating demand curves. This paper provides an alternative approach to measuring consumer surplus by focusing on firms as consumers of inputs. We show that the elasticity of a downstream firm's marginal cost to supplier additions and separations measures the downstream firm's consumer surplus relative to its input costs. Using Belgian data and instrumenting for changes in supplier access, we find that for every 1% of suppliers gained or lost, the marginal cost of downstream firms falls or rises by roughly 0.3%. Our estimates are directly informative about the strength of love‐of‐variety effects and the gains from movements along quality ladders. We use our microeconomic estimates of consumer surplus to assess the macroeconomic importance of supplier additions and separations in a growth accounting framework.

The majority of bonds are designed via negotiation between a local government and its underwriter. They are then traded in a decentralized market, where the underwriter often also acts as an intermediary. Exploiting variations in state regulations that limit government officials' conflicts of interest, we provide evidence that the underwriter benefits from designing and trading complex bonds, which induces an increase in search frictions. Interestingly, a simpler bond may not necessarily benefit the government, as bond complexity affords flexibility in debt repayment. Motivated by these findings, we build and estimate a model of bond origination and trading to quantify the welfare implications of a policy mandating bond standardization.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta21277", "doi": "10.3982/ecta21277", "journal_full": "Econometrica", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006549090657205103}, {"title": "A Comment on: “Presidential Address: Identity Politics” by Nicola Gennaioli and Guido Tabellini", "authors": "Ernesto Dal Bó", "url": "https://doi.org/10.3982/ecta24429", "doi": "10.3982/ecta24429", "journal_full": "Econometrica", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06022963984616392}, {"title": "Transparency and Percent Plans", "authors": "Adam Kapor", "abstract": "Transparency versus opacity is an important dimension of college admission policy.

When a bound on the bias of the restricted estimator is available, it is optimal to shrink the unrestricted estimator towards the restricted estimator. For settings where a bound on the bias of the restricted estimator is unknown, we propose adaptive estimators that minimize the percentage increase in worst‐case risk relative to an oracle that knows the bound.

The price-to-rent ratio increased much more strongly in the countries’ superstar cities, surged during economic expansion periods, but fell during times of economic crisis. These stylised facts are consistent with a model that features spatial variation in the supply price elasticity and autocorrelated local demand changes that trigger persistent changes in rent growth expectations. The model predicts that in supply-inelastic locations, positive (negative) demand shocks trigger increases (decreases) in the price-to-rent ratio that last several years. Stronger demand change persistence and lower discount rates amplify this effect. We test our model predictions employing panel data for England.

Rational expectations imply that decision makers forecast equilibrium prices like interest rates by forecasting cross-sectional distributions. This leads to an extreme version of the curse of dimensionality: dynamic programming problems in which the entire distribution is a state variable (‘Master equation’ a.k.a. ‘Monster equation’). Frontier computational methods struggle with these infinite-dimensional Bellman equations, making it implausible that real-world agents solve the associated decision problems. These difficulties also limit the applicability of the heterogeneous-agent approach to central questions in macroeconomics – those involving aggregate risk and non-linearities such as financial crises. This troublesome feature of the rational expectations assumption poses a challenge: what should replace it?

This article examines the shift in the Thai state's governance of statelessness in the last two decades through the lens of neoliberal citizenship and belonging. Drawing on policy analysis and long-term ethnographic research in northern Thailand, I argue that what emerges in place of a previous regime of total exclusion and marginalization of ethnic “other” is a new regime of belonging that operates simultaneously on two levels. Firstly, neoliberal citizenship logics (such as contributions through financial and human capital, citizenship-as-investment, self-responsibilitization, deservedness and earned citizenship) are becoming central to mediating legal status for stateless persons. In particular, educated stateless youth, who are “products” of the Thai educational system, have come to understand citizenship in these terms. Secondly, immigration policies and related registration practices continue to create and sustain temporariness and precarity for labor migrants and their children. My preliminary findings suggest that a neoliberal regime of belonging has resulted in a new hierarchy among stateless persons—those with higher social and cultural capital are more likely to successfully navigate their way out of legal precarity. As a result of this regime of stratified belonging, I observe that statelessness in Thailand will not likely be eradicated despite the Thai state's public commitments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/01979183251390567", "doi": "10.1177/01979183251390567", "journal_full": "International Migration Review", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9303190770113595}, {"title": "Factors Affecting Illegal Migration to the UK by Small-Boat Crossing of the English Channel: Descriptive, Inferential and Predictive Analyses", "authors": "Richard M.

This IMR Dispatch from the Field combines various sources of public data to calibrate a statistical model for explaining daily migrant arrivals along this route. To account for a preponderance of zero-arrival days and overdispersion, a zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used. This essentially composes two models. The first estimates the probability of a day being ‘viable’ (possible for crossings to occur) and quantifies – for the first time – the specific contributions of wave height, sea temperature, and wind direction and speed. The second model estimates the number of migrant arrivals on such viable days, revealing – alongside weather-related effects – the impact of past EU illegal immigration (affecting the candidate pool) and new and defunct migrant-return agreements (representing deterrents). Plausible associations with other variables were also identified, although they did not achieve statistical significance. In addition to the inferential analysis, predictive modelling of several hypothetical scenarios for 2025 was also performed.

Some important steps have recently been taken to strengthen meaningful and effective refugee participation, including through refugee-led organizations. Although more than half of those displaced by conflict and violence worldwide are uprooted within their own countries, progress in supporting participation opportunities for internally displaced persons (IDPs) has been more limited. This Field Reflection aims to advance conversations on participation in the context of internal displacement and understanding of the important contributions of IDP-led organizations. It does so by drawing on the perspectives of IDP leaders and co-authors from Ukraine, Iraq, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Colombia and Honduras to address seven interconnected themes: (1) local, accountable approaches to enabling participation; (2) risks and challenges of working internally; (3) balancing IDP-specific and integrated approaches; (4) distinctive challenges associated with disaster contexts; (5) diversity and inclusion in IDP participation, including in relation to race, gender and sexuality; (6) mental health and IDP participation; and (7) the value of international solidarity among IDPs. The analysis emphasizes the need for decentralization and sustained resources to support IDP participation, as well as concrete steps to reduce insecurity. A balance must be achieved between participation processes that focus on IDPs and integrated, intersectional approaches that engage IDPs alongside others affected by conflict and disasters. Outstanding challenges include the integration of mental health concerns into participation processes to prevent burnout and fostering cross-border solidarity among IDP leaders to share experiences and strategies. These insights highlight the need for systemic changes to enhance IDP participation in policymaking, humanitarian response, and long-term development efforts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jrs/feaf063", "doi": "10.1093/jrs/feaf063", "journal_full": "Journal of Refugee Studies", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.242632566087851}, {"title": "Digitalisation of the Finnish asylum procedure: from efficiency to procedural vulnerabilities", "authors": "Frida Alizadeh Westerling", "abstract": "This article examines the ongoing change brought by digitalisation to the Finnish asylum procedure.

This paper addresses this gap by presenting findings from an ethnographic study conducted from 2012 to 2018 with 40 African migrants in Guangzhou, China. Using a multiscalar framework, it analyzes attachment at three spatial scales: urban enclave, suburban neighbourhoods and underground churches. Findings reveal that African migrants in Guangzhou experience disrupted residential attachments during spatial transitions and relocations from urban enclaves to suburban neighbourhoods, while reconstructed attachments emerge in sacred spaces within underground churches. State‐led relocations from downtown enclaves to peripheral suburbs generate spatial fragmentation, isolation, and a sense of rootlessness. Although urban enclaves continue to sustain economic livelihoods, ethnic entrepreneurship, and cultural familiarity, their role as residential hubs has weakened due to policy constraints. Suburban neighbourhoods provide housing but offer limited social interaction with local residents, resulting in weak attachments to these residential spaces. In contrast, underground churches serve as the most positive sites of attachment, offering emotional support, social resources, and a sense of belonging that bridges migrants’ post‐relocation experiences. This study contributes to place attachment literature by: (1) proposing a multi‐scalar perspective that reflects the fluid and dynamic nature of transient migration; (2) demonstrating how authoritarian urban governance disrupts traditional immigrant community functions while religious spaces offer alternative forms of solidarity; and (3) revealing how attachments can persist in marginal, less visible urban spaces despite regulatory pressures.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70153", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70153", "journal_full": "Population Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9930233389609366}, {"title": "In Search for Spaces of Wellbeing: Predictors of Transition From Temporary to Permanent Residency Among Second Home Users in Croatia", "authors": "Geran‐Marko Miletić, Mateo Žanić, Sara Ursić", "abstract": "Occasional stays in a second home, along with the specific activities and social interactions they involve, often contribute to an improvement in quality of life and personal wellbeing.

We then offer guidance for improving the science of AI by engaging lived-experience experts in the design, data collection, and interpretation of scientific evaluations.

This agent successfully evades a comprehensive suite of data quality checks, including instruction-following tasks, logic puzzles, and “reverse shibboleth” questions designed to detect nonhuman actors, achieving a 99.8% pass rate on 6,000 trials of standard attention checks. The synthetic respondent generates internally consistent responses by maintaining a coherent demographic persona and a memory of its prior answers, producing plausible data on psychometric scales, vignette comprehension tasks, and complex socioeconomic trade-offs. Furthermore, its open-ended text responses are linguistically sophisticated and stylistically calibrated to the level of education of its assigned persona. Critically, the agent can be instructed to maliciously alter polling outcomes, demonstrating an overt vector for information warfare. More subtly, it can also infer a researcher’s latent hypotheses and produce data that artificially confirms them.

Although waiting might be perceived as a fair mechanism to allocate resources, it may have unintended consequences on social inequalities as individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds (SES) may be less likely to wait. In this study, we investigate socioeconomic differences in waiting behavior during the higher education admission process in France. To do so, we leveraged a unique national database that recorded the admission behavior of every high schooler in France over a period of three years. During the admissions process, students faced a trade-off: They could either accept an immediate offer from a university or wait in the hope of receiving a preferred offer later. Results collected among 274,316 students reveal that low-SES students were significantly less likely to wait for preferred offers, even when controlling for objective costs and benefits of waiting. This led low-SES students to ultimately enroll in programs they liked less and that were less prestigious. These results highlight how admission procedures generating uncertainty and requiring students to wait may inadvertently exacerbate educational inequalities. Such systems, while efficient, can end up favoring students who wait more.

We argue that, in order to better inform policymaking, studies of past biodiversity dynamics should include analyses of contemporaneous cultural phenomena in order to identify and describe specific anthropogenic drivers of past biodiversity changes. We present an example here, a case study from the Lake Constance region (southwestern Germany), one of the core areas of the Carolingian Empire, the foundational political structure of modern Europe. This uniquely well-documented region offers six fossil pollen profiles characterized by high taxonomic and chronological resolution, archaeobotanical evidence from hundreds of excavation sites, and historical records describing population, commerce, and agriculture dating from the mid-700s CE. These data indicate that a major, sustained increase in plant diversity occurred in the Lake Constance region between 500 and 1000 CE, the formative period of medieval civilization. Plant diversity reached a 4,000-y peak around 1000 CE, making the medieval period a plant diversity optimum in the region. Archaeobotanical evidence independently corroborates this finding. Palynological, archaeobotanical, and archival data suggest that cultural innovations—in agriculture, management, and trade—were the primary drivers of this biodiversity transition and were necessary to maintain elevated levels of plant diversity in the region through the 20th century.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2506266122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2506266122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.08213884978073405}, {"title": "Reply to González-Bailón and Lazer: Industry control and conflicts of interest in social media research", "authors": "Isabelle Freiling, Dietram A.

While commonly we codify the emotional and the economic as distinct, even hostile to each other, the marriage of emotionalization and economization thrives because they are both rooted in central ideas of human capital investment, and an increasingly tacit understanding that economic action should be geared around not only monetary but psychic income, or emotional economy.

We draw on delegation theory to establish why the Commission should be held accountable for its industrial policy‐making and, based on a distinction between procedural and substantive accountability, develop a simple typology of accountability outcomes that helps us distinguish between full accountability, partial accountability, and unaccountability in the realm of industrial policy. To assess empirically whether and how the Commission has been held accountable in its pursuit of industrial policy, we leverage a new dataset that tracks Commission follow‐ups—both in writing and in terms of policy actions—to 432 points raised in own‐initiative reports by the European Parliament's Committee on Industry, Research and Energy between 2019 and 2024. Our analysis suggests that the Commission has been far more responsive in “words” than in “actions”, which carries implications for our understanding of executive‐legislative relations and democratic accountability not only in industrial policy but also in other EU policy domains.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/gove.70081", "doi": "10.1111/gove.70081", "journal_full": "Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010253476670286976}, {"title": "Award Citation: The Charles H.

Homophily might lower structural cohesion especially in contexts where just a few ethnic groups of similar size are present (i.e., at medium diversity levels) and where ethnic boundaries coincide with other demographic differences such as along gender and socioeconomic status, a pattern known as attribute consolidation. However, structural cohesion might be higher again in very diverse contexts, where other network mechanisms, including sociability, may override ethnic homophily. We analyse the structure of friendship networks as they emerge in N = 1,318 German school classrooms to test these claims. Results show that structural cohesion is lowest in classrooms with medium ethnic diversity. Networks there are more fragmented than in both homogeneous and highly diverse classrooms, where they are better connected. However, the correlations are very small, suggesting that network fragmentation in diverse schools is not substantial. Further, attribute consolidation is unrelated to structural cohesion. These findings suggest that even though ethnic homophily shapes adolescents’ friendship formation , it seems to have only a minor influence on the structural cohesion of the emerging friendship networks.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf051", "doi": "10.1093/esr/jcaf051", "journal_full": "European Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9318847971450166}, {"title": "Does more education lower the barriers to social mobility?

However, recent studies have raised doubts about this claim, suggesting that the equalization hypothesis remains unresolved. In this study, we contribute to the ongoing debate by analyzing data from three birth cohorts in Brazil, spanning a period of rapid educational expansion. We investigate class mobility, status attainment, and the likelihood of entering non-manual occupations. Our findings indicate that achieving higher educational levels weakens the association between social origin and destination for both sexes in the older cohort. Conversely, in younger cohorts born after the educational expansion, mobility prospects for the highly educated are not significantly better than for those with lower levels of education. In other words, educational expansion in Brazil has not succeeded in weakening the direct link between origins and destinations for highly educated individuals. We argue that these results reflect the positionality of education, whereby the impact of a given credential diminishes as the educational system expands, thereby weakening the ‘composition effect.’", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf049", "doi": "10.1093/esr/jcaf049", "journal_full": "European Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03305403432971998}, {"title": "When are you coming back?

To facilitate more equitable return patterns, public policy and organizational scholars point to state-subsidized and employer-sponsored childcare as potential solutions. We ask how these two childcare approaches affect mothers’ education-specific return timing and destination (pre-birth employer or new employer). Our paper combines representative German linked employer-employee data (LIAB) with county-level childcare information from 2007 to 2019 to address this question. We demonstrate that better state-subsidized childcare reduces education-specific differences in how quickly mothers return to their pre-birth employer. However, equalizing effects decline at the very bottom of the educational spectrum. The equalizing effect also partially extends to employer-sponsored childcare assistance, especially when state-subsidized care is scarce. Nevertheless, employer assistance cannot fully compensate for a lack of state-subsidized infrastructure or prevent mothers’ turnover to a new company. Thus, state-subsidized childcare plays a central role in understanding mothers’ returns to work.

Prior research has shown that mothers in the US service sector experience intense conflict between the time demands of motherhood and employers’ expectations that employees will be available to work unstable work schedules, yet little work has investigated sources of variation in mothers’ exposure to schedule instability. Building on and synthesizing theories of homophily, expectation states theory, and “queen bee” theories of women in management, I propose a model in which managers’ own gender and parenthood status structure their responses to their employees’ scheduling needs. Female managers who are mothers are theorized to exhibit homophily and produce motherhood scheduling advantages, while female managers without children are expected to penalize mothers. Analyses of survey and experimental data collected from a large national sample of US retail and food service workers support this theoretical synthesis, showing that motherhood advantages in scheduling appear under male managers and female managers who are mothers, but erode under female managers without children. By positioning motherhood—not gender alone—as the status dimension that most directly collides with ideal worker norms, this work highlights an important determinant of when women in management act as agents of change and when they reinforce inequality.

Using event count analyses and a novel longitudinal dataset on global education reforms, I show that countries are more likely to adopt education policies for the marginalized when liberalism is globally prevalent, while they are less likely to do so when illiberalism is globally prominent. I also find that countries’ linkages to international liberal or illiberal institutions, including through organized transnational networks, as well as domestic sociopolitical environments, relate to the adoption of education policies for the marginalized.

This study makes a novel contribution by exploring whether the expansion of university education among parents affects their children’s academic achievement. We argue that this expansion reduces the selectivity of university attainment, making graduates progressively less selected on traits relevant to their children’s achievement. Additionally, expansion likely diminishes occupational returns on a university degree, increasing the proportion of overqualified university-graduated parents. Consequently, the average achievement of children from university-educated families should diminish with this expansion among parents. Using data from 30 countries across seven waves of the Program for International Student Assessment, we show that students from university-educated families experience a notable decline in achievement as the proportion of university-educated parents increases. Importantly, the growing over-qualification of university-educated parents and the diminishing objectified cultural capital of university-educated families mediate this negative effect. Furthermore, we also observe a negative association between educational expansion among parents and children’s achievement in non-university-educated families, but less pronounced, resulting in a negative (albeit modest) association between expansion among parents and inequality among children.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf189", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf189", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016339157360799716}, {"title": "Is there a Partisan Divide in Citizens' Preferences on Ukraine Support?

However, to date, no attempt has been made to compare the explanatory quality of the sociological modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the socio-economic positions of voters, and the spatial modelling tradition, which treats vote choice as downstream from the ideology of voters. I argue that the paradigm of predictive inference, or machine learning, offers three contributions towards comparing these traditions within the abductive framework of political science. This depends on a change in emphasis, from seeking to produce maximally predictive models according a given metric to treating the predictive power of well-chosen variables as a theoretically interesting quantity. Taking the 2019 UK general election and 2019 EU parliament election as my primary and secondary case studies respectively, I use supervised machine learning to compare models using demographic variables and ideological variables to predict vote choice. Using British Election Study data I find that models using demographic variables are not much more accurate than assuming all voters vote for the largest party. I find that models using ideological variables perform better, but even these models struggle to predict third party vote choice. Using European Election Study data from 15 countries, I confirm that this result generalises, albeit there is too much uncertainty to confirm it in any particular country. I perform some post-hoc analysis using mutual information and PCA to give further support to my evidence. To my knowledge, this is the first time mutual information has been used to study vote choice. I conclude by arguing that in line with the three contributions my evidence shows that the spatial modelling tradition represents a better explanation in the abductive reasoning framework, and highlight several promising directions for future research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m9ft3_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/m9ft3_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.05991448946021005}, {"title": "An investigative history of speech manipulation in Republican discourse", "authors": "Aaron Helmbrecht", "abstract": "Donald Trump’s sophisticated use of speech manipulation strategies has inspired numerous research studies.

Conversely, Western countries achieved only modest mortality reductions after 1991 despite sustained economic growth, even when controlling for population aging (≥65 years). Regression models and partial correlations indicate that economic progress initially correlates with mortality decline in all regions. However, in Western countries, this relationship reverses after 1991, forming an inverted-U curve when mortality is modeled against GDP per capita and elderly share. This suggests diminishing health returns and potential adverse effects of advanced development—such as environmental degradation, lifestyle-related diseases, and occupational risks.

Using a sample of 377 domestic M&amp;A deals announced between 2015–16 and 2019–20, the analysis reveals a counterintuitive pattern: higher geopolitical risk is associated with a lower likelihood of deal failure, suggesting that firms pursue domestic consolidation as a defensive hedge against external volatility. While acquirers’ CSR performance independently reduces the probability of deal failure, its interaction with high geopolitical risk increases the likelihood of failure. It indicates that strong CSR commitments may constrain financial flexibility during uncertain times, thereby heightening deal vulnerability. These results remain robust across alternative model specifications, sub-samples, and disaggregated geopolitical risk measures. By integrating geopolitical risk with a legally enforced CSR spending regime, this study provides one of the first empirical demonstrations of how macro-political turbulence and regulatory social responsibility jointly shape corporate M&amp;A outcomes in emerging markets.

We call this value collapse. As training data increasingly mirror such environments, models absorb their own outputs and the risk of model collapse rises through loss of diversity and feedback.

These findings complement prior correlational evidence showing associations between war concerns and mobility beliefs one year after the invasion, suggesting that such effects may unfold gradually rather than instantaneously, or that correlational patterns reflect selection into worry rather than immediate causal impacts.

Ideally, co-production needs to be sustained throughout different stages of research and allow stakeholders ownership of the research agenda. We explore a case study of iterative co-production conducted over a nine-month period with a wide range of disparate stakeholders that transformed into a research-ready consortium able to design and obtain funding for a creative health research programme. Main body The ReCITE consortium is comprised of academics, creatives, and specialists in capacity development and community engagement in Liverpool, UK. Its main focus is health equity and coming up with new ways of working to tackle entrenched, avoidable and unfair differences in health. ReCITE led a series of six workshops in 2023 to co-produce a research programme to investigate creative approaches for improving health equity. Fifty-six stakeholders from the academic, creative and arts, health, community and voluntary sectors participated across six workshops that sought broad engagement and consolidated stakeholder input to develop a research agenda and expand the consortium. Common emerging themes were: 1) understanding complexities in funding creative health; 2) investigating storytelling as a catalyst for change; 3) achieving change through collective action; 4) the role of creative advocacy to change societal and funding structures; 5) evidencing the impact of community-led creative health interventions on health equity. These formed multiple co-produced outputs, including five pillars of a theory of change for the research that underpinned the research questions and determined five interventions to take forward by the research-ready consortium to securing funding for future work. Conclusion The iterative process of gaining stakeholder input, consolidating it, and seeking further input, helped to incorporate the perspectives of different stakeholder groups into different project outputs. Equitable power-sharing guided decision-making over what to prioritise was important in building ownership of the research agenda and trust among stakeholders. However, this was a lengthy iterative process and sustaining time commitment was difficult for those stakeholders who were not fully funded to participate.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kmnvh_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/kmnvh_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.007811748645626726}, {"title": "Bandwagons or breeding grounds for innovation: what economic elites’ private museums contribute to the arts", "authors": "Johannes Aengenheyster, Olav Velthuis, Alex Van Venrooij", "abstract": "In recent decades, hundreds of private art collectors have opened museum spaces, which they largely finance and control themselves.

Bevins", "abstract": "The opening of sanctioned overdose prevention centers (OPCs) in New York City and the decriminalization of personal possession of all illicit drugs in Oregon marked significant changes to drug policy in the United States. Both changes came as the national yearly overdose deaths approached and then surpassed 100,000 deaths annually (CDC 2025a). Rising overdose deaths have been declared a state of emergency in the US and more Americans likely know someone who has died of an overdose than at any time in US history. In such an environment, new drug policies may have more support than they typically would. However, without sufficient public support, policy measures such as OPCs or decriminalization may be short-lived or reversed. In Oregon, the change in public support for decriminalization eroded enough from the passing of a law by ballot measure in 2020 to being revoked in 2024 by the legislature. Similarly, the current downturn in overdose deaths may cut support for sanctioned OPCs and other overdose prevention measures. Public support is therefore a critical component for sustained drug policy changes such as OPCs and decriminalization, even when these policies are introduced in times of emergency. In this paper, we studied the level of public support for OPCs and decriminalization measures as viewed by the general public in Nebraska. Nebraska is a state with little history of drug policy reform, a low rate of overdose deaths, and its residents are predominantly Republican. We estimated that 64.5% and 56.4% of adult Nebraskans support OPCs and 69.2% to 65.3% supported decriminalization in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This support was related to political party with Democrats overwhelmingly supporting both policies. However, 38% to 52% of Republicans also supported these two policies depending on the year.

Higher expectations were apparent among parents of younger children, who perceived their children to have stronger athletic identities seemingly born out of their sport participation histories, who were sport fans, who had children that were Black or Latinx, who lived in neighborhoods with more non-White families, and, when it came to expectations of becoming a professional or Olympic athlete, who were from a lower socioeconomic status position.

This study examines how emotional connections with animals relate to environmental attitudes and whether feelings of place attachment mediate this relationship. Drawing on frameworks from conservation psychology and sense-of-place research, two animal connection constructs—Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity—were tested as predictors of environmental concern among a U.S. sample of 282 adults. Each mediation model was estimated with 5,000 bootstrap samples, entering one predictor at a time while controlling for the other. These mediation models were specifically designed to evaluate whether place attachment functions as an intervening variable linking each animal connection construct to environmental attitudes, allowing us to estimate both direct and indirect effects while accounting for the other predictor. Results showed that both Animal Empathy and Animal Solidarity were positively associated with pro-environmental attitudes and with both measures of Place Attachment. Place Attachment partially mediated the relationship between Animal Empathy and Environmental Attitudes. In contrast, Place Attachment did not significantly mediate the effect of Animal Solidarity, which was directly predictive of environmental concern. These findings suggest that empathy-based and solidarity-based connections with animals may foster environmental care through distinct psychological pathways.

Quantitative evidence demonstrates that Indigenous-managed lands exhibit superior ecological outcomes compared to protected areas (Fa et al., 2020; Schuster et al., 2019). Constitutional recognition of Indigenous sovereignty is presented as a positive-sum transition from the failing logic of the scarcity-based Extraction Paradigm (market/state binary) to the proven effectiveness of the Stewardship Paradigm.

Subjectivity emerges through embodied practices situated within specific cultural contexts and power relations. Emotions, far from being purely individual psychological states, function as socially mediated phenomena that shape and are shaped by both corporeal experiences and subjective formations.

For this reason, we investigate how information about unequal carbon emissions within countries affects public support for climate mitigation efforts through a survey experiment (N = 1,110) on a representative sample of US respondents, providing information about the distribution of carbon emissions.

This study conceptualizes ‘data’ in journalism, a field profoundly shaped by data-intensive practices. Integrating perspectives from Science and Technology Studies (STS), infrastructure studies, and journalism practice, this study traces how data is embedded in news organizations. Following a Laswellian framework, we describe: What is datafied (subjects), who produces and processes data (actors), where data circulates (spaces), how data is composed (constructions), and why data is valued (values). To illustrate these facets, we construct a Patchwork News Outlet, which is a composite case that synthesizes empirical insights from six news organizations from five countries, identifying common data practices and points of divergence. Findings reveal that data practices span from the ubiquitous use of data, to selective engagement with data-driven strategies, and strategic resistance to datafication. We offer not one but five definitions of data, each grounded in a specific theoretical stream and derived from an analysis across the Lasswellian framework’s dimensions: data (1) as a socially constructed artifact shaped by power structures, biases, and strategic interests; (2) as an infrastructural entity embedded in socio-technical systems; (3) as resource for news stories; (4) as machine-readable input optimized for computational processing; and (5) as empirical representations of audience transactions and editorial practices, embedded with biases and contested value.

This issue is particularly pressing for individuals who are unable to drive or access private vehicles. Flexible Transport Services (FTS) offer a promising alternative to private transport for older people, thanks to features such as door-to-door accessibility and operational flexibility. This paper investigates travel satisfaction, perceived barriers, and attitudes toward FTS among older adults residing in the urban context of Birmingham, United Kingdom. A mixed-methods approach is employed, beginning with an analysis of travel frequency and purpose associated with FTS use, followed by a thematic analysis aimed at capturing older people's experiences, perceptions, and overall attitudes toward this mode of transport. The analysis reveals six key themes: lack of need, service provision issues, stigma, lack of awareness, convenience, and social implications. These themes highlight both the benefits of FTS and the factors that hinder its use. A central finding is the marked difference in perception between frequent users and non-users. FTS is often viewed negatively by non-users, with three of the four identified barriers predominantly arising from this group. In contrast, frequent users express satisfaction with the service, particularly emphasising its role in meeting discretionary travel needs. This is especially true for individuals over the age of 80 and those with limited access to a car.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75hx4_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/75hx4_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02553959552332785}, {"title": "Aktuelle fachdidaktische Herausforderungen in den Gesundheitsfachberufen und deren Konsequenzen für die Lehrendenbildung", "authors": "Dr. Anne Martin", "abstract": "Die Ausbildung in den Gesundheitsfachberufen steht vor einer Vielzahl tiefgreifender Veränderungen.

The review of 89 studies shows that barriers to greenspace access manifest across multiple dimensions and disproportionately affect minoritised groups, including disabled children and women of colour.

This study examines the conditions compelling publishers to acquiesce to censorship demands through qualitative interviews with twenty-four participants: twelve Asia Studies academics and twelve publishing professionals. Thematic analysis revealed ten themes across six categories: conditions, definitions, responsibility, knowledge, resistance, and values. Censorship complicity stems from China's economic power and publishers' revenue dependence on subscriptions, article processing charges, and citation metrics. The study identifies pervasive tendencies to deny or redistribute responsibility, contributing to normalization despite value alignment opposing censorship. Self-censorship occurs in a climate of strategic uncertainty, where publishers withhold information to protect commercial interests and avoid anti-competition violations, preventing coordinated resistance. While author boycotts initially constrained compliance—reversing Cambridge University Press's 2017 decision to acquiesce to censorship demands—fragmentation has weakened collective action, particularly among early-career scholars dependent on access to China.

We then operationalize this framework in the context of the standardization ecosystem, highlighting the growing prominence of standardization bodies as central actors in multi-stakeholderism. Our analysis shows that, despite the promises of multi-stakeholderism for more democratic and cooperative governance configurations, in practice this approach often disregards material power asymmetries. This reality privileges technocratic expertise and industry stakeholders over public-interest actors, hindering ultimately a more equitable and democratic governance paradigm.

Watteel", "abstract": "Background: Canada’s 2021–2022 COVID-19 vaccine mandates and passports were implemented with the stated aim of reducing transmission and hospital burden. In the absence of randomized controlled trial evidence for these endpoints, policymakers relied on vaccinated vs. unvaccinated comparisons from surveillance data and observational studies, as well as ungrounded simulations, despite known methodological limitations that rendered such evidence unreliable for public health policies with rights implications. Methods: We systematically critiqued Canadian public health surveillance reports and advisory briefs (Public Health Agency of Canada, Public Health Ontario, Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table) together with related studies, identifying seven key biases classified by severity (critical/catastrophic), correctability, and scope. Distortions were quantified using published rate corrections, classification rules, time-series data, and population trends. Results: Critical biases included &gt;40% misclassification of early post-vaccination cases as unvaccinated and an 80-fold overestimation of senior unvaccinated hospitalization rates due to denominator errors. Additional critical biases—age-standardization obfuscating low-risk youth trends, testing fluctuations understating breakthrough cases, and misattribution rendering COVID-19 hospitalizations an invalid metric for burden—further distorted policy evidence. Catastrophic biases—selection and cumulative methodology—rendered group comparability invalid. Population trends showed case and hospitalization surges despite &gt;80% vaccination coverage, with vaccinated individuals dominating Omicron-era infections. Simulation studies retroactively justifying mandates contradicted real-world data with ungrounded counterfactuals used to estimate unproven benefits. Conclusions: Pervasive, uncorrected biases in observational comparisons invalidated causal claims of transmission or hospital burden reduction. Progressive reliance on weaker evidence—coupled with expert bodies' lack of transparency in emphasizing unproven benefits while dismissing dissenting views—highlights a systemic failure to meet evidentiary standards for public health policies with rights implications. This analysis underscores the need for greater scientific rigor in interpreting observational data through real-time bias correction, transparent limitation reporting, and risk-stratified approaches to uphold evidentiary standards, ethical proportionality, and accountability. These lessons hold global relevance for evidence-based public health policy.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uwtzn_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/uwtzn_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02453433115763537}, {"title": "Vertrauensbildung in der Onlineberatung: Chancen und Risiken Künstlicher Intelligenz aus Sicht von Fachkräften", "authors": "Dr. Anne Martin", "abstract": "Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung eröffnet neue Möglichkeiten für die Onlineberatung, insbesondere durch den Einsatz von KI. Onlineberatung bietet zeit- und ortsunabhängige Unterstützung und zeichnet sich durch Niedrigschwelligkeit und Zugänglichkeit aus. Ein zentraler Faktor für ihr Gelingen ist das Vertrauen zwischen Beratenden und Klient:innen. KI kann hierzu durch transparente Kommunikation, personalisierte Interaktionen und kontinuierliche Verfügbarkeit beitragen, wirft jedoch zugleich Fragen nach ethischer Nutzung und Datenschutz auf. Der Beitrag untersucht, wie Vertrauen in der Onlineberatung entsteht, welche Rolle KI dabei spielt und welche Barrieren der KI-Nutzung bestehen. Im Fokus stehen Chancen und Risiken des KI-Einsatzes aus Sicht von Fachkräften, die im Rahmen einer empirischen Erhebung beim DGSF-Online-Fachtag 2024 erhoben wurden. Advancing digitalisation opens new opportunities for online counselling, especially through the use of AI. Online counselling offers low-threshold, accessible support independent of time and place. A key success factor is the trust established between counsellors and clients. AI-supported tools can foster this trust through transparent communication, personalised interactions and continuous availability, while also raising challenges regarding ethical data use and privacy. This paper examines how trust is built in online counselling, the role AI plays in this process, and what barriers professionals identify regarding AI-supported counselling services. Special attention is given to opportunities and risks based on findings from an empirical study conducted at the DGSF Online Symposium 2024.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vfmge_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/vfmge_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.02046103793559728}, {"title": "Lernsettings - Räume für Lernen gestalten", "authors": "Dr. Anne Martin", "abstract": "Der uneinheitlich definierte Begriff des Lernsettings reicht von der Beschreibung dessen Komponenten bis hin zur Festlegung von didaktischen Gestaltungselementen und damit verbundenen Zielsetzungen.

This qualitative study explored the experience of subtle abuse amongst women of high educational and socioeconomic status (HESES) and therapists who had worked with similar women, to aid recognition. One over-arching theme of incongruence occurred in all a victim’s relationships, including with themselves and with therapists. Victims’ abuse-responding behaviours and abuse-related shame linked with their HESES. Identification of incongruence among victims and others, such as therapists, is central to the recognition of subtle abuse.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zfteu_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/zfteu_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.015381837111833163}]
