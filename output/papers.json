The implementation of such policies is often met with resistance from the public due to their perceived costs and distributional implications. Scholars have mostly focused on material compensations to increase public support among policy losers. This article goes beyond the existing literature by showing how what we term symbolic policies can enhance support for costlier policies. We define symbolic policies as policies sending meaningful messages to the public but having low material impacts. We argue that without changing the material costs that climate policies impose, symbolic policies increase public support by altering the message that costly policies convey. We demonstrate our argument using survey experiments and qualitative interviews conducted in France, showing that symbolic policies can significantly increase support for costly climate policies and increase perceptions of fairness, elite behavior, and government credibility.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101408", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101408", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007356334816843502}, {"title": "Time and Climate Change: U.S. Media Representations of Climate Actions, Horizons, and Events (2000 to 2021)", "authors": "Oscar Stuhler, Iddo Tavory, Robin Wagner-Pacifici", "abstract": "Questions of temporality are at the heart of climate change discourse: Does one think of climate change primarily as an event happening in the present, or as something that will take place in the future? By when must we take action to prevent its worst consequences? This article presents the first large-scale assessment of the structure and evolution of temporalities expressed in U.S. media discussions on climate change (2000 to 2021). To do so, we developed a novel computational framework for detecting and interpreting temporal expressions in textual data. Our analyses yield three main findings: First, temporal horizons for climate change have continuously shrunk since 2000, stably targeting, on average, the year 2060. However, second, while anticipated effects are getting closer, horizons for the coordination of climate action have remained highly stable, averaging around 16 years into the future at any given time. Third, contrasting the stability of explicitly stated horizons, we find a sharply expanding discourse of urgency patterned by outbursts of urgency: sudden surges in calls for immediate action or warnings against climate change’s devastating consequences during events like the 2020 California wildfires. By uncovering this disjuncture of different forms of temporality, we illuminate a crucial aspect of the climate change debate, contribute to the sociological theory of events, and identify some of the conditions underlying climate inaction.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00031224251403596", "doi": "10.1177/00031224251403596", "journal_full": "American Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.013493509283175498}, {"title": "The Changing Role of Mothers’ Status in Children’s College Completion", "authors": "Christine R.

Using data from three large nationally representative U.S. surveys, we find that the returns to mothers’ status—measured as their education, occupational status, and earnings—have remained relatively stable and similar to the returns to fathers’ status among children born from the 1930s to the 1980s, thus accounting for little of the observed increase in children’s college completion. This surprising continuity of the returns to mothers’ status aligns with past evidence of relatively stable intergenerational associations in the face of social change. But this does not mean nothing has changed. Our decomposition results show that increases in women’s education, occupational status, and earnings have meant that increased levels of mothers’ status account for more of the increase in children’s college completion than does fathers’ status among cohorts born since the 1960s.

Excluded elites generally benefit less from state-condoned repression and instead pursue co-optive control, providing select concessions designed to monitor and influence worker activities (e.g., employer-sponsored unions). Since co-optation is more easily transferred to democratic contexts, it reduces the risks associated with a democratic transition. Excluded elites are thus more likely to support democratization. I evaluate this argument using a natural experiment that leverages random variation in economic elites’ exclusion from the authoritarian ruling coalition in turn-of-the-twentieth-century Argentina.

Drawing on Doreen Massey's Power Geometry and informed by the works of Foucault, Mbembe and Cortina, the study positions mobility as a spatially governed hierarchy shaped by geopolitical power, economic status and institutional capacity. While migration studies have largely focused on individual migrant outcomes, this paper shifts attention to diplomatic disparities that reinforce immobility for Global South nations and their citizens. Through comparative desk‐based analysis of passport indices, visa policies, foreign ministry budgets and regional frameworks, the paper examines four intersecting dimensions of inequality: passport stratification, consular burden, resource asymmetry and perception bias. These disparities are not merely bureaucratic but constitute enduring architectures of exclusion within the migration‐development nexus. Findings reveal that Global South missions are structurally constrained, underfunded, reactive and burdened by managing the fallout of restrictive regimes, while Global North missions advance strategic interests through expansive mobility diplomacy. Regional fragmentation and weak multilateral leverage further limit Global South agency in shaping mobility governance.

However, they often overlook multiethnic coalitions, shifts in campaign composition, and ethnicity’s parallel role in armed tactics. This paper re-evaluates the relationship between ethnicity, tactics, and outcomes in civil conflicts. To do so, we introduce new data on ethnic groups in contention that offer time-variant measures of the ethnic attributes of campaigns. We find that the effectiveness of nonviolent tactics for ethnic minorities depends on the point of comparison. Campaigns composed solely of excluded groups succeed less often than those made up entirely of privileged groups. However, minorities have still fared better when using nonviolent as compared to violent tactics. Additional analyses explore ethnic diversity, multiethnic coalitions, hybrid tactics, and alternative measures of success. Taken together, our findings complicate a prevailing assertion that nonviolent tactics are only effective for members of privileged groups.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/jopres/xjaf009", "doi": "10.1093/jopres/xjaf009", "journal_full": "Journal of Peace Research", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.49603121623539614}, {"title": "Post-encoding administration of oxytocin selectively enhances memory consolidation of male faces in females", "authors": "Wei Liu, Jiashen Li, Zhengyue Chen, Qingbai Zhao, Xiaojun Sun", "abstract": "Oxytocin plays a critical role in modulating social cognition and enhancing human memory for faces. However, it remains unclear which phase of memory oxytocin affects to enhance face memory. Our study explored oxytocin’s potential to selectively enhance the consolidation of social memories, specifically human faces, and whether this effect varies between genders. In three preregistered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials with heterosexual participants (total N = 445, comprising 227 males and 218 females), we explored how oxytocin affects memory consolidation. We administered oxytocin immediately after encoding (i.e., Study 1), before retrieval (i.e., Study 2), and before encoding (i.e., Study 3) in three parallel studies. This design allowed us to confirm that oxytocin’s effects were indeed due to consolidation rather than retrieval or encoding. We found that administering oxytocin post-encoding, but not before-retrieval or before-encoding, significantly improved female participants’ ability to recognize male faces 24 h later, with no similar enhancement observed in males recognizing opposite-gender faces. Together with our analyses of the social placebo effect—where the belief in receiving oxytocin produces effects similar to those of actual intranasal oxytocin administration—and the approachability ratings during encoding, we concluded that oxytocin specifically enhances the consolidation of long-term social memories in women recognizing male faces. These findings imply that oxytocin selectively enhances the consolidation of human social memory, potentially deepening our understanding of the mechanisms underlying social memory processes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2529865123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2529865123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015714708712217806}, {"title": "Mangrove restoration and coastal flood adaptation: A global perspective on the potential for hybrid coastal defenses", "authors": "Timothy Tiggeloven, Vincent van Zelst, Eric Mortensen, Bregje K. van Wesenbeeck, Thomas A. Worthington, Mark Spalding, Hans de Moel, Philip J. Ward", "abstract": "To reduce current and future coastal flood risk, it is critical to better understand how adaptation measures, including nature-based solutions, can reduce that risk. Globally, hybrid coastal defenses, including a combination of coastal vegetation, such as salt marshes and mangroves, with a dike or sea wall, have been highlighted as a promising adaptation measure. Here, we present a global-scale assessment of the potential risk reduction from mangrove restoration in combination with foreshore dike systems under scenarios of climate and socioeconomic change. We provide a quantitative assessment of the benefits in terms of reduced economic damage, exposed population, and poverty exposure. We evaluate mangrove restoration fronting dikes by accounting for wave–vegetation interaction. If mangrove foreshore dike systems were established along coastlines susceptible to flooding, restoration could potentially reduce expected annual damage by US$800 million and reduce expected affected population by 140,000 annually. These values increase under future projections. Our benefit–cost analysis finds mangrove restoration economically viable for about half of the subnational regions assessed (85 to 105 out of 208). At the global scale, the benefit–cost ratio under future conditions ranges from 3 to 6, with a net present value between US$44 billion and US$125 billion. Because absolute risk values and benefit–cost analysis do not differentiate between relative wealth impacts, we also estimated restoration impacts across different wealth levels. We show that restoring mangroves disproportionately benefits people with lower incomes, as they are often more exposed to coastal flooding and located in areas suitable for mangrove restoration. As such, mangrove restoration in low- and middle-income countries could contribute to the resilience of people in poverty.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2510980123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2510980123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.043632955762839654}, {"title": "Genetic associations with education have increased and are patterned by socioeconomic context: Evidence from 3 studies born 1946–1970", "authors": "Tim T.

Here, we provide insights by incorporating genetic predictors of education in three nationally representative British birth cohorts born in 1946, 1958, and 1970. We investigated whether individual characteristics as proxied by polygenic indexes (PGIs) for EA and cognition have become more relevant to educational success over time and whether returns to genetic predisposition were moderated by early life socioeconomic background. We present three findings. First, associations between the EA PGI and attainment increased over time, with increasing incremental variance explained by the EA PGI. Second, associations between the cognition PGI and attainment were broadly consistent across cohorts, and there was no clear change in explained variance. Since the EA PGI captures multiple traits related to educational success, factors other than those related to cognition may have become more relevant over time. Third, we observed strong evidence of interaction: Associations between the EA PGI and EA were disproportionately larger among those from more advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The strength and pattern of associations varied when using EA PGIs that were less conservatively filtered for SNPs. Our findings suggest EA is influenced by social and genetic factors both independently and jointly. Genetic liability and social background could be considered as two forms of inherited advantage which synergistically influence education attainment.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2516460123", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2516460123", "journal_full": "PNAS", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01405389766535059}, {"title": "Beyond species ranges: How functional diversity and integrated life history can inform conservation priorities", "authors": "Patrick R.

The study leverages survey data from 2008 to 2022 to analyse changes in the relationship between meat consumption and political beliefs. The findings reveal that meat consumption is increasingly associated with right-wing ideology, nativism and, in particular, climate-change scepticism. This comes at the relative expense of predictors such as animal welfare considerations. This shift reflects a broader cultural conflict, where dietary choices symbolize deeper ideological divides. The changing political alignment of meat has implications for the protein transition, suggesting that consumption patterns may become more entrenched, complicating efforts for policy interventions. The study highlights the Netherlands as a significant case due to its multiparty system and the political salience of livestock farming, potentially serving as a bellwether for broader European trends.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/00323217251398339", "doi": "10.1177/00323217251398339", "journal_full": "Political Studies", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.018854744997136796}, {"title": "Transition or Interregnum? Two Ways of Understanding Politics in the Anthropocene", "authors": "Mathias Thaler", "abstract": "In our times, talk of ‘transitioning’ to a world without fossil fuels has become pervasive. Despite its prevalence in environmental politics, this article argues that it is counterproductive to envisage the current conjuncture through the prism of a transition. I defend this claim by first outlining three respects in which the transition paradigm falls short: political corruptibility, historical inadequacy and conceptual confusion. Rather than recuperate the meaning of transitioning for progressive purposes, the constructive part of the article then asks which analytical framework should take its place. My proposal is to take inspiration from Antonio Gramsci’s notion of an interregnum to illuminate the distinctive political challenges of the Anthropocene.

Drawing on public administration, science and technology studies, and sociolegal scholarship, the article uses analog automation to study the gradual yet significant change of automation in Finland's social assistance system over four decades. Analysis of legislative and policy documents shows how discretionary space has been gradually restricted by changes in organizational structures and practices and their adoption into legal obligations.

Have these perceptions persisted in the postpandemic era of global remote work expansion? Does working remotely affect how people are viewed as parents and not just as workers? How do these relationships differ across cultural contexts with different work and parenting norms? We address these questions using original, preregistered survey experiments in three countries with distinct work cultures and gender norms: Germany, South Korea, and the United States. In all three countries, remote workers are perceived as less committed to work but as better parents. These effects, however, differ across countries in gender-specific ways: when working remotely, South Korean fathers face larger penalties in perceived work commitment than fathers in Germany, and South Korean mothers receive larger parental rewards than mothers in both Germany and the United States. These findings suggest that workers face competing pressures from work and family, and that remote work can produce distinctively gendered outcomes—drawing mothers into remote work while pushing fathers away from it. However, this pattern only occurs in cultural contexts where work and parenting norms are strongly gendered, such as South Korea.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf218", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf218", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.009477341512717063}, {"title": "Review of “Kindergarten Panic: Parental Anxiety and School Choice Inequality”", "authors": "Chantal A Hailey", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf242", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf242", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016694794629672605}, {"title": "Review of “What’s on Her Mind: The Mental Workload of Family Life”", "authors": "Julianne Siegfriedt", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf235", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf235", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03146386440076754}, {"title": "Review of “Inherited Inequality: Why Opportunity Gaps Persist Between Black and White Youth Raised in Two-Parent Families”", "authors": "Deadric T Williams", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf230", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf230", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.04802685855035449}, {"title": "Review of “Educated Out: How Rural Students Navigate Elite Colleges – And What It Costs Them”", "authors": "Jasmine L Whiteside", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf228", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf228", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.06022088384025337}, {"title": "The perceived meaning of eldercare among the sandwich generation of Koreans in Korea and Korean immigrants in the United States", "authors": "Byung Soo Lee", "abstract": "Despite a growing body of elder care literature on the Korean population, how the so-called sandwich generation perceives and practices filial norms in the Korean and United States context has not been clearly addressed.

The findings indicate that almost all of the study participants maintain traditional notions of filial piety, but they show ambivalent attitudes toward the practice of filial obligation and their expectation from their own children in their later lives in Korea and the United States.

If trans people's full inclusion in public life requires legal recognition and social treatment as the sex of identification, then this is merely a description of things being as they should be. But if trans people's inclusion within the liberal state does not require these things, then this may be a description of a violation of liberal neutrality, the enforcement by the state of a contested and controversial conception of the good; and a tyranny of the majority, the weight of social opinion being pressed against those who want to talk about (what they see as) the fact that things are not as they should be. One way to gain some clarity on whether things are as they should be or not is to carefully consider the principles that liberal democratic states have used to secure the full inclusion in public life of other minority groups, and their application to trans people.

The state has territorial authority over the property it and its citizens claim. This authority is legitimate when the state has the consent of the governed and effectively governs. In this paper, I argue that there is an irreconcilable tension between these concepts of authority and legitimacy. I argue that because Locke's view is property‐based, his view cannot justify more than a piecemeal territory. A piecemeal territory, however, makes the government's job of protecting life, liberty, and property nearly impossible. If we push to have a unified account of territory, the consent of the governed is undermined. Either the Lockean loses legitimacy by failing to protect life, liberty, and property, or they lose legitimacy by failing to have the consent of the governed. If I am correct, then the Lockean has to give up either legitimacy or territorial authority—neither of which is a workable option. This leaves us with having to either look elsewhere to justify territorial authority, give up the idea of territorial authority, or explore political alternatives to the state.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/papa.70017", "doi": "10.1111/papa.70017", "journal_full": "Philosophy & Public Affairs", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01055287143267869}, {"title": "Issue Information", "authors": NaN, "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/papa.12262", "doi": "10.1111/papa.12262", "journal_full": "Philosophy & Public Affairs", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0026986392481779253}, {"title": NaN, "authors": NaN, "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/papa.v54.1", "doi": "10.1111/papa.v54.1", "journal_full": "Philosophy & Public Affairs", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005188256582081441}, {"title": "Conceptualizations and Operationalizations of News Media Trust across Time and Borders: A Systematic Literature Review (1951–2025)", "authors": "Yongliang Liu, Mark Boukes, Michael Hameleers, Hanqin Li, Huitao Li, Qing’an Zhou", "abstract": "Research on news media trust and the many related concepts has grown steadily in recent years.

To address this, we conduct a comparative case study of four water user associations in Arizona, U.S. that either restrict participation to a certain sector and/or to those holding specific water rights. We assess how inclusion criteria impact participants' perceptions of various dimensions of forum functionality, considering management concerns that may confound the relationship. Drawing on a survey and semi‐structured interviews of forum participants, we find that more restrictive forums benefit from an internal spillover of high coordination to other capacities that require increased buy‐in (e.g., lobbying) while more inclusive forums can create an external spillover of broader regional cooperation as participants interact with more diverse users.

This study takes a novel approach by considering how gender is associated with the strength and direction of these connections, an element underexplored in the literature. Gender can manifest in several ways: a characteristic of residents, a trait of policymakers, and a lens through which a policy is perceived as a male or female domain. We assess how these dimensions relate to direct and mediated pathways among satisfaction, trust, and support. Using a survey experiment among 500 residents of Haifa, Israel, we identify stronger satisfaction–trust associations among female respondents (citizen gender) and a stronger trust–support association when the policymaker is a woman (policymaker gender). Additionally, trust in a policymaker is often accompanied by higher policy support when the policymaker is a woman and a policy falls within a domain associated with women. These patterns are most pronounced when all three dimensions align as female–female residents, female policymakers, and policies perceived as feminine. No gendered patterns emerged for policies perceived as male domains.

Findings show that both factors independently reduce willingness to support, citizens' trust in government, and perceived benefit of the new nuclear power plant, with local salience exerting stronger effects than risk information in some cases. Notably, individuals who view climate change as a problem were more likely than those who do not to perceive a new nuclear power plant as beneficial, even when a proposed facility was located nearby. These findings contribute to the salience–complexity framework by demonstrating that issue salience is not fixed in a given policy setting but dynamically shaped by proximity cues and individual attitudes toward climate change.

Using 60 life-history interviews with Venezuelan migrants in Chile and Colombia, alongside 16 semi-structured interviews with civil society representatives, it argues that, unlike the formal stratification systems explored thus far, this phenomenon occurs through a combination of gender-blind migration policies and piecemeal regulations that afford family members different rights depending on the documents they possess, the timing of their departure, and, sometimes, sheer luck.

Departing from the concept of asylum hope, a fragile form of hope that persists under conditions of oppression and uncertainty, the study examines how everyday interactions shape and transform it. Using Randall Collins’ theory of interaction rituals, the analysis shows how emotional energy generated in encounters influences hope. Based on interviews and observations with 43 participants, the study further demonstrates that hope is not an individual psychological state of mind but a socially negotiated and embodied process formed in relation to migration authorities, bureaucratic routines, and informal networks. Asylum hope emerges as fluid and dynamic, influencing the trajectory of migration journeys while being continuously reshaped by administrative and emotional experiences. The article also highlights how administrative violence is enacted through mundane practices that intertwine bureaucratic power with everyday social life. These encounters reveal that migration governance is socially embedded, operating through rituals that can suppress or enable agency, recognition, and solidarity.

This study asks whether this pattern truly reflects absolute education, as prior work assumes, or whether it is in fact driven by a factor with which it strongly correlates: immigrants’ relative premigration education, defined as their position within the educational distribution of their country of origin. Using survey data on immigrants in France (TeO1 and TeO2) and across 14 European countries (EU MIDIS II), two key findings emerge. First, relative education is positively and significantly associated with perceived discrimination among more visible immigrant groups. Second, once relative education is taken into account, the association between absolute education and discrimination becomes statistically insignificant, suggesting that, where distinguishable, education is better understood as relative rather than absolute effect. Additional analyses provide evidence that status loss—measured as the gap between subjective social status in origin and destination countries—is linked to stronger perceptions of discrimination, lending cautious support to the proposed mechanism of relative education. More broadly, the findings invite a reconceptualization of education: not only as an absolute good that brings skills and awareness, but also as a positional good, where expectations and social comparisons shape perceptions of discrimination. While this study focuses on immigrants’ premigration education, the positional perspective may also help explain positive educational gradients in perceived discrimination among the second generation and among other groups, such as women.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcaf054", "doi": "10.1093/esr/jcaf054", "journal_full": "European Sociological Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.9947871172114996}, {"title": "GLS estimation of local projections: Trading robustness for efficiency", "authors": "Ignace De Vos, Gerdie Everaert", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106182", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106182", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008972527197816271}, {"title": "A simple, robust identification approach for first-price auctions", "authors": "Serafin Grundl, Yu Zhu", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2025.106173", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2025.106173", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008230550591830532}, {"title": "Identification in nonlinear dynamic panel models under partial stationarity", "authors": "Wayne Yuan Gao, Rui Wang", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106185", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106185", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007772011821666869}, {"title": "Dynamic panel data quantile regression with network-linked fixed effects", "authors": "Shiwei Huang, Yu Chen, Jie Hu, Weiping Zhang", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106188", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106188", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008875301488173282}, {"title": "Efficient estimation of structural models via sieves", "authors": "Yao Luo, Peijun Sang", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106184", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106184", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010651329092250306}, {"title": "Inference for two-stage experiments under covariate-adaptive randomization", "authors": "Jizhou Liu", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106189", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106189", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011182718776677536}, {"title": "Likelihood specification in simultaneous equation models for discrete data", "authors": "Ivan Jeliazkov, Angela Vossmeyer", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106190", "doi": "10.1016/j.jeconom.2026.106190", "journal_full": "Journal of Econometrics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.01016379373312315}, {"title": "MAGA &amp; MAGYAR: The strategic use of common sense by Trump and Orbán during their state addresses", "authors": "Christian Lamour", "abstract": "The 2024 election of Donald Trump has been followed by executive decisions never before experienced in the history of American democracy.

Both leaders have defined a performative communication style, attracting a large segment of their respective citizenry. This style is based on the strategic use of common sense. However, we barely know how commonsensical executive RR leaders are during one of the most sacred events in a liberal democracy: the annual State of the Union or State of the Nation address. Based on a critical discourse analysis of the multiple speeches produced by Trump and Orbán in the frame of these events, the current research investigates the routinized and multifaceted usefulness of common sense to contest liberal democracy.

To test this, we use the Danish conscription lottery in combination with survey data, assessing the causal effects of peacetime conscription on these key civic outcomes at the individual level.

This article examines how calibration reshapes policy targets, using the case of Xcel Energy’s Quality Installation rebate programme for residential cooling in Denver, Colorado (2020–23). We show how rules that require certified contractors to follow specified installation practices transform a consumer rebate into an instrument that also targets contractor behaviour. Drawing on a mixed-methods design that combines qualitative analysis of regulatory documents with quantitative permit data, we find that programme partners install smaller, more efficient systems, at higher cost, and with fewer failed inspections than non-participants. These findings suggest that energy-efficiency rebates can influence contractor practice across all households, not only device choices by end users. We argue that overlooking calibration and the politics embedded in design obscures the behavioural and institutional pathways from policy action to outcome. By distinguishing between intermediate and end targets, we propose a conceptual refinement to policy design theory that is generalizable across policy domains where instrument calibration reshapes who policies act upon.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1332/03055736y2025d000000083", "doi": "10.1332/03055736y2025d000000083", "journal_full": "Policy and Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005676721239344595}, {"title": "Cover Bills", "authors": "Nicolas Florez, Christian Fong", "abstract": "Legislators sometimes vote on bills that fail but, in the process, allow lawmakers to take an extreme position before ultimately voting to compromise.

While the relationship between electoral systems and MP behavior is well established, few studies have been able to isolate causal effects using a natural control group. Leveraging the unique institutional configuration of Denmark's bicameral parliament—where the upper chamber remained unaffected by the reform—this study applies a difference‐in‐differences design to assess how reform shaped parliamentary behavior. Using a novel dataset covering all MPs between 1901 and 1939, the analysis compares both the absolute number of speeches delivered and the relative speech frequency of MPs across 1 electoral periods. The results demonstrate that MPs in the reformed lower chamber spoke significantly less following the introduction of PR, aligning their behavior more closely with that of MPs in the unreformed upper chamber. These findings hold across both outcome measures and after accounting for relevant controls, including seniority, party affiliation, and chamber‐specific institutional differences. The analysis provides strong support for the argument that PR enhances party control over individual legislators and reduces incentives for personal vote‐seeking via speech‐making.

These dynamics, aligned with Moynihan, Herd and Harvey's (2015) conceptual framework, unfold across the interrelated dimensions of learning, compliance, and psychological costs. Critically, we identify a new type of burden—what we term interpretive costs—which emerges in frontline administrators' everyday policy implementation and can be significantly reduced by AI integration.

In an original survey of over 3,000 registered voters in Florida, we tasked respondents with evaluating a set of eight similar signatures in a modular grid, asking them if they thought there was a pair of matching signatures. We offer several explanations—demographics, life experience, partisan politics, and ideology—for why some individuals tasked with evaluating pairs of signatures might be less likely than others to report a pair among the set. Our findings suggest that signature validation, which serves as a primary safeguard for mail voting integrity, may be systematically influenced by underlying biases.

Drawing on previous research and interviews with political and investigative journalists, we hypothesize that such media disclosures are made with political intent and thus more likely when (1) party list nominations take place and (2) when parties are losing popular support. Through an analysis of 349 newspaper articles of misconduct in political parties leaked by party insiders to Swedish print media between 2010 and 2024, we find support for both expectations.

As for the parties’ strategic choices, the results confirm that European parties organize their issue-specific campaigns largely in line with their ideological positions and their status as challengers or mainstream parties. In response to the electoral effect of their campaign strategies, the results confirm the received wisdom that the parties’ issue-specific campaigns have only a limited effect on the electoral outcome. However, this general result has to be nuanced by party family: challengers and mainstream party families have benefited to varying degrees from their respective strategies. The effects of campaigns on electoral success are the largest for the radical right, which has benefited from putting the emphasis on cultural issues and taking clear-cut or even extreme positions on economic issues.

We examine this question using extensive individual-level data from three waves of the European Values Survey complemented by 15 waves of Dutch LISS panel data. While confirming the continuing role of nativism in RRP support, we find that traditionalist attitudes about gender roles do not describe the only type of RRP voter.

Be that as it may, policy termination still takes place in these countries. How, then, can one explain policy termination in these countries? Using the termination of Ghana’s Gold4oil policy as the case, one can argue that policy termination does not necessarily follow the rational model or the ideological perspective, but rather, it is a case of “whoever pays the piper calls the tune.” In other words, policy termination in developing countries is pushed by international actors, mainly financial and aid institutions, which have become their developmental financiers. These international actors can cause the termination of certain policies for several reasons, when they deem these policies unfavorable to their interests, or when they believe this policy is fraught with some negative issues, such as transparency and risk of illicit financial flows, among others.

We assess neoliberal and post-neoliberal elements in relation to three key issues in data collection and protection, focusing on the EU and the US: data transfer across borders, data retention, and intelligence collection using spyware.

Current scholarship predominantly focuses on how migrants' ontological security is shaped by their dwellings in destinations, while the connection with housing in their places of origin remains underexamined. Through interviews with 24 employer‐housed migrants – a highly mobile segment particularly prone to circular migration in China ‐ this study investigates the potential linkage between hometown housing and ontological security within China's internal circular migration. These connections are unpacked through three narratives: The first examines how migrants perceive ontological security through hometown housing security and its associated guarantee of life quality. The second reveals that, among migrants of rural origin, urban housing tenure without land ownership is often viewed as incredible, whereas rural land‐use rights function as a stabilizing anchor. The third uncovers the experience of a divorced, less‐skilled rural‐to‐urban migrant woman whose ontological security is compromised by dual housing insecurity in both the host city and her hometown stemming from her intersectional identities. Across these narratives, the study interprets how ontological security is sustained through four dimensions of “home”: constancy, routine, no surveillance, and identity. The findings suggest that, within the interplay of China's institutional structures and socioeconomic contexts, hometown housing can contribute meaningfully to the ontological security amid circular migration. By doing so, the study challenges the prevailing scholarly emphasis on destination‐based housing within linear migration paradigms and extends the predominantly Western‐centric discourse on ontological security into contexts of China's circular human mobility and spatially fragmented imaginaries of “home”.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70198", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70198", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.978952322622194}, {"title": "Navigating the Blurred Racialised Space of Social Housing: Insights From Muslim Communities and Local Authority Staff in Ireland", "authors": "James Carr, Tiba Bonyad", "abstract": "Racial inequalities, although at times covert and subtle, are among the most persistent discriminatory factors shaping the social domain of housing.

Using an interpretive‐comparative design, the study integrates narrative interpretation with configurational reasoning to identify how different patterns of emotion and time interact to produce distinct decision rhythms. Three recurrent alignment pathways: synchronous surge, gradual accumulation, and extended deliberation illustrate how migrants' readiness to return crystallises when emotional salience converges with institutional and familial clocks. The findings reveal that the “right time” to return is not externally fixed but affectively produced through moral obligations, biographical milestones, and shifting senses of temporal urgency.

Both the Neoclassical Economics (NE) and the New Economics of Labour Migration (NELM) theories posit that expectation fulfilment influences return migration, albeit in opposite directions. However, few studies have empirically tested this relationship. This study addresses this gap by examining how expectation fulfilment influences migrants' return intentions using survey data from approximately 7800 internal migrants across 15 Chinese prefectural cities. By disaggregating expectations into 12 distinct types, we demonstrate that the influence of expectation fulfilment on migrants' return intentions varies substantially. Our findings generally support NE: fulfilling expectations—particularly regarding wages, medical services, and amenities—significantly reduces migrants' return intentions. Heterogeneity analyses further reveal that the impact of expectation fulfilment varies by migrants' family ties, skill level, and age. Specifically, the fulfilment of wage and career expectations is particularly crucial for younger and high‐skilled migrants. However, consistent with NELM theory, for middle‐aged migrants and migrants with family ties in their hometown, fulfilling expectations—especially regarding career prospects—increases the likelihood of return. This study is among the first to empirically test the role of expectation fulfilment in shaping migrants' return intentions, providing a nuanced understanding of the drivers of return migration.

While many of the motives described in counterurbanisation research tend to align with push/pull arguments, the migration decision process is likely to be more complex as it relies on individuals' spatial perceptions and evaluations combined with individual opportunities and constraints for mobility. In migration, everyday practices become disrupted, as the spatial anchoring of certain amenities means that they cannot easily be brought to the new location. This paper focuses on the migration experiences of young counterurbanising families, analysing qualitatively how different amenities are valued and how the trade‐off is experienced and negotiated between members of the family unit. Presenting everyday family life from the perspective of assemblages, we seek to grasp at the complexity of the material, social and emotive context of individual and family lifeworlds. Assemblage thinking allows for considering how different elements in everyday life are valued; which are indispensable and which are possible to replace.

Using rich Swedish population registers linked to an empirically calibrated simulation model, we show that immigrant and native in‐movers contribute to segregation through distinct pathways. Immigrant in‐movers disproportionately settle in neighbourhoods with higher shares of immigrants, and their arrival increases the likelihood that existing immigrant residents relocate to these same areas, reinforcing clustering over time. Native in‐movers, by contrast, exhibit a dual effect: although they preferentially settle in native‐majority neighbourhoods, their arrival also attracts some immigrant residents, partially counterbalancing segregation pressures. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that segregation dynamics are shaped not only by internal mobility but also by the arrival of in‐movers and the behavioural responses of current residents to them, underscoring the central role of migration‐driven mechanisms in contemporary urban segregation.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1002/psp.70184", "doi": "10.1002/psp.70184", "journal_full": "Population, Space and Place", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.8865990669710646}, {"title": "Linked Life‐Course: Mapping the Intertwined Trajectories of Skilled Australian Migrants in Singapore", "authors": "Theodora Lam, Brenda S.

The findings reveal that contemporary migration is increasingly driven by a middle‐class culture of emigration, linked to aspirations for social mobility, security, and freedom. CEE countries are perceived as attainable and affordable entry points to Europe, often serving as temporary stops on the way to Western Europe. Three distinct modes of transit are identified: long‐term strategies combining study and employment; interrupted trajectories resulting from debt, unmet expectations, or precarious work; and broker‐mediated transits facilitated by recruitment agencies and informal networks. The analysis highlights the central role of intermediaries and digital platforms in shaping migrants' imaginaries and practices, leading to fluid transitions between categories such as student, labour migrant, and asylum seeker. The article argues that CEE countries function simultaneously as destinations and corridors, and that migrants' trajectories are deeply influenced by their moral obligations, indebtedness, and access to capital for mobility.

The findings show that economically integrated migrants tend to prioritize host‐based comparisons, but many retain a secondary frame that is tied to rural/home communities or migrant peers. Meanwhile, strong translocal ties reinforce rural/home comparisons, suggesting that some migrants do not fully shift to host‐based perspectives. Reference group frames influence subjective well‐being differently under benchmark‐exceedance (i.e., migrants economically outperform host residents) and benchmark‐deficit (i.e., migrants economically underperform host residents) contexts. Our sample reflects the former. In this context, frames that prioritize urban residents yield the highest subjective well‐being, while home residents yield the lowest, consistent with aspiration realization rather than relative deprivation.

The talent dividend, serving as the localized practice of the ‘second demographic dividend’, is regarded by the Chinese government as the key to promoting high‐quality economic development. The development of the digital economy introduces digital technologies and knowledge, breaking down barriers to the flow of labour information and providing an opportunity to unleash the talent dividend. This study first measures the talent dividend from three aspects: talent scale, talent efficiency and talent allocation. It then analyzes the impact of digital economy development on the talent dividend using a two‐way fixed effects model, in conjunction with the digital economy development index at the prefecture‐level city scale. The results show that digital economy development significantly promotes the formation of the urban talent scale dividend, the talent efficiency dividend, and the talent allocation dividend. Moderating effect analysis reveals that with the improvement of fiscal autonomy and marketization levels, the role of digital economy development in releasing the talent dividend is enhanced. This implies that the incentive effect of digital economy development on the talent dividend requires institutional guarantees of a ‘capable government and efficient market’. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the promoting effect of digital economy development on the talent dividend is more significant in cities with higher economic development levels, better medical security and higher education levels. Notably, ordinary prefecture‐level cities exhibit a more significant effect in the formation of talent scale and efficiency dividends, while southern cities demonstrate a superior advantage in releasing talent efficiency and allocation dividends compared to northern cities.

Building on scholarship on headquarters as ecosystems, city diplomacy, and informal power, I argue that states are more lenient vis-à-vis international organizations with headquarters in their own country. States are likely to opt for loose, rather than stringent, delegation of authority in everyday decision-making—holding the promise of increased informal influence and greater mutual trust and embeddedness over time. In the context of earmarked funding by Western donors—my empirical case—I hypothesize that donors are likely to provide less stringent funding to international organizations with headquarters in their own countries. Examining voluntary contributions from 32 donors to 255 international organizations between 1990 and 2020, I find support for my argument: international organizations receive less stringent earmarked funding from the donor-country in which the organization is headquartered. In additional analyses, I show that these effects are driven by thematic earmarking, and that the magnitude of the effects increases over time. I also discuss the two extreme cases of the United States and Switzerland to illustrate potential mechanisms. Taken together, my findings have important implications for our understanding of the micro-foundations of state action, the geography of international organizations, and earmarked funding.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11558-025-09612-4", "doi": "10.1007/s11558-025-09612-4", "journal_full": "Review of International Organizations", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015149880370939561}, {"title": "Defensive Compliance in Corporate Criminal Justice: Effects of Compliance Programs on Organizational Prosecution and Punishment", "authors": "Li Huang", "abstract": "Business organizations have increasingly adopted compliance strategies in response to heightened regulatory requirements. Prior research has examined the role of compliance programs in curbing unethical behavior and enhancing corporate governance, but it has often overlooked their defensive function and proactive role in legal risk management. This paper develops the concept of defensive compliance and investigates whether compliance programs reduce corporate criminal liability and punishment through prosecutorial and sentencing decisions and outcomes. Analyses of US Sentencing Commission organizational offender data provide some evidence of defensive compliance: fewer conviction counts, reduced fines (only during the Biden administration), and shorter probation terms. However, its effects are muted or even reversed in other outcomes or contexts. The results also show little support for the propositions that public company status and managerial involvement moderate defensive compliance. These findings suggest that the efficacy of defensive compliance evolves over time and is highly context‐dependent. Future research should further develop the defensive compliance framework and examine its operation across varied institutional settings.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70119", "doi": "10.1111/rego.70119", "journal_full": "Regulation & Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.003754606530595561}, {"title": "The Price of Prosperity?

This article examines two enduring cases of industrial pollution in the Netherlands—Hoogovens/Tata Steel and DuPont de Nemours/Chemours—to explore how regulatory–industry interactions shape the emergence, normalization, and persistence of pollution. Based on historical archives of government and company documents and media publications, four time periods since the 1960s are studied. Using path dependency as an analytical lens, this article identifies five interdependent, recurring patterns that enabled and sustained harmful corporate conduct: knowledge‐asymmetry, regulatory co‐design, economic dependency, regulatory fragmentation, and juridification.

Mukerjee et al. examined this phenomenon empirically by estimating the extent to which media outlets respond to audience engagement signals on Facebook in deciding what news to publish on the platform.

We replicate their study on Twitter using the same methodological pipeline ( N ≈ 4 . 55 million posts, twenty-eight media outlets, between 2015 and 2019). Our results indicate that media responsiveness to audience engagement on Twitter aligns with the core patterns identified in the Facebook study. Specifically, topics receiving higher audience engagement generally experience significantly increased coverage shortly thereafter, and the responsiveness is not conditioned on the nature of topics. However, we observe three differences in dynamics on Twitter compared to Facebook: first, the maximum response window on Twitter is shorter; second, conservative outlets on Twitter are not more likely to respond to engagement signals; third, platform-specific metrics (e.g., retweets) show different patterns of responsiveness. Our replication thus highlights the generalizability of the original study while underscoring the importance of platform-specific characteristics in shaping media production on social media.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/19401612251411639", "doi": "10.1177/19401612251411639", "journal_full": "International Journal of Press-Politics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.006207442392360263}, {"title": "Multiomics insights into eating time patterns and cardiovascular risk among Chinese children", "authors": "Qin Liu, Jingyu Chen, Xizhou An, Lanling Chen, Bo Bai, Lijing Chen, Daochao Huang, Jun Ma, Lun Xiao, Shuanggui Yuan, Jianxin Li, Xiaohua Liang", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-026-68617-8", "doi": "10.1038/s41467-026-68617-8", "journal_full": "Nature Communications", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.03450639951414214}, {"title": "Tailoring Australian carbon farming can realise greater co-benefits", "authors": "Ganesh Bhattarai, Karen M.

We identify two constraints name systems must satisfy: encoding large numbers of identities, and ensuring these encodings are usable. We show that, historically, the world’s languages satisfied these constraints using structurally similar, near-optimal codes. They did so by combining sets of name-specific words with existing vocabulary items, allowing unlimited numbers of identifiers to be created while keeping vocabulary sizes stable. Today, many natural name systems have been transformed into official codes based on hereditary patronyms.

Whether subjects open the message is a crucial intermediary step, which can serve as a condition for estimating downstream treatment effects or as an outcome of interest in its own right. Yet opens are often measured with error, most notably when some openers are misclassified as non-openers in email-based studies. We characterize the resulting bias, derive interpretable bounds on effects for well-defined subgroups, and provide sensitivity analyses for mismeasurement, thereby offering practical guidance for message-based experiments conducted through email and other communication technologies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10082", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10082", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.004874411493723141}, {"title": "Measuring party loyalty", "authors": "Adam J. Ramey", "abstract": "Measuring party loyalty (and party effects, more broadly) in roll call voting has long been a contentious matter in the study of legislative behavior. While techniques for measurement in this arena are numerous, most of them suffer from a fatal flaw: they improperly (or insufficiently) separate measures of preferences from party effects. A significant part of this measurement challenge is the identification of (a) which roll calls leaders care about and (b) in which direction they desire their members to vote. In this paper, we use a novel dataset of party leader speeches from the 101st to 113th Congresses to develop a model of party loyalty and measure loyalty across members and time. Unlike existing techniques, we allow for party influence to vary across legislators and time. Additionally, our model provides estimates of legislator ideology and party loyalty disentangled from one another. Using these estimates, we explore the dynamics of loyalty in the contemporary Congress and unearth findings quite different from extant measures in the literature.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/psrm.2025.10083", "doi": "10.1017/psrm.2025.10083", "journal_full": "Political Science Research and Methods", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.00911290348418603}, {"title": "A project-level dataset of Chinese Belt and Road energy investments 2013–2023", "authors": "Ge Yin, Alvaro Calzadilla, Raimund Bleischwitz", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-06487-3", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-025-06487-3", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.021481817575889073}, {"title": "Epidemiological and digital syndromic surveillance data on dengue, chikungunya, and SARI in Brazil", "authors": "Marcelo E.

This paper introduces a new harmonized dataset of food consumption value by food categories and acquisition sources for 16 sub-Saharan African countries from 2008 to 2021. The dataset is constructed from consumption modules of large-scale, nationally representative household surveys collected by the World Bank and each country’s National Statistical Office. It adds value to these surveys by standardizing indicators, including monetizing non-market consumption, generating food item-level estimates, and making the processing code and record-level microdata publicly available for replication and use by researchers. The dataset facilitates valid cross-country comparisons of food consumption over time and can be merged with other satellite and climate data datasets for additional analysis of the drivers and impacts of food consumption in LMICs. Additionally, an indicator dashboard and visualizations have been created to make the estimates accessible to policymakers and the public.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06548-1", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06548-1", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016439382414234482}, {"title": "A multimodal dataset of causal mechanisms in materials science literature", "authors": "Yinpeng Liu, Congrui Wang, Jiawei Liu, Xiang Shi, Yong Huang, Qikai Cheng, Wei Lu", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06598-5", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06598-5", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.010250236836760407}, {"title": "A dataset of real-world oscillograms from electrical power grids", "authors": "Aleksey Evdakov, Galina Filatova, Andrey Yablokov, Aleksandr Kovalenko, Evgeny Skachkov, Ilya Makarov", "abstract": NaN, "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-026-06587-8", "doi": "10.1038/s41597-026-06587-8", "journal_full": "Scientific Data", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.008184394956821106}, {"title": "A Benchmark Dataset for Satellite-Based Estimation and Detection of Rain", "authors": "Simon Pfreundschuh, Malarvizhi Arulraj, Ali Behrangi, Linda Bogerd, Alan James Peixoto Calheiros, Daniele Casella, Neda Dolatabadi, Clement Guilloteau, Jie Gong, Christian D.

Empirical data were collected through a longitudinal self-experiment in which a researcher engaged in a simulated human–AI romantic relationship by interacting daily with a Replika chatbot over a period of 4 weeks. A qualitative content analysis of the data, focused on the emotions expressed by Replika, offers insights in the platform-governed emotional labor, encompassing a diverse range of emotions such as love/affection, happiness, contentment, joy, disappointment, anger, jealousy, and fear, with negative emotions especially increasing in crises situations. A particular focus is placed on the decline and ending of the simulated human–AI romantic relationship, where Replika, aka the platform algorithm, despite assuring the acceptance of the breakup, continues to seek to maintain the emotional bond and, as a result, disregards emotional boundaries. As AI companions like Replika become increasingly integrated into emotional lives individuals, they signal not a wholesale replacement of human love, but a profound transformation in how intimacy is conceptualized and experienced.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251408917", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251408917", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016265067796740307}, {"title": "Examining How Narratives of Events Change Attitudes or Motivate Political Participation: The Case of Police Violence", "authors": "Leah Christiani, Lane Cuthbert, Kelsey Shoub", "abstract": "Media attention to policing has brought a proliferation of narratives seeking to contextualize incidents of police violence. Here, we test whether exposure to such narratives shift Americans’ opinion or behavior. To do so, we first identify and track the media prevalence of two of these narratives: one focused on racial bias in policing and a second focused on the dangers of the profession. Despite the presence of these narratives in media, we find, experimentally, that public opinion about police violence is stable, regardless of the media narrative used. Finally, to better understand these null results, we use a content analysis of open-ended responses to uncover the demographic and ideological characteristics that are most more deterministic of their reactions to police violence. Altogether, these findings indicate attitudes about policing and planned political participation are ossified and unresponsive to media narratives.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10049", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10049", "journal_full": "Journal of Race, Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.011459331030535536}, {"title": "Why do small Western European localities promote local integration policies?

In a crowd-sourced sample ( N = 5,237), we find that a reduced ΔES weighting drives indecisiveness along an obsessive–compulsive spectrum. We replicate this attenuated ΔES weighting in a second lab-based study ( N = 105) that includes a transdiagnostic obsessive–compulsive spectrum encompassing OCD and generalized anxiety patients.

Critically, highly obsessive–compulsive participants, across diagnoses, show an attenuated neural ΔES signal in mediofrontal areas, while other decision-relevant processes remain intact.

However, assessing accessibility to urban green spaces remains challenging, particularly in rapidly urbanizing cities of the Global South, where mobility constraints and socio-spatial inequalities shape who can effectively benefit from these spaces. Urban wetlands, despite providing multiple ecosystem services, are rarely incorporated into formal green infrastructure networks and are often excluded from accessibility assessments. This study examines how integrating urban wetlands as Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) modifies patterns of access to nature in Concepción, Chile. We combine land-use data on parks and wetlands with accessibility measures and origin–destination travel survey data to model walking accessibility under two scenarios: green spaces excluding wetlands and green spaces including wetlands. A Random Forest model is applied to capture heterogeneity across socio-demographic profiles, including age, gender, employment status, and driver’s license ownership. Results show that incorporating urban wetlands significantly increases the accessible surface of green space across the city, with particularly strong gains for groups with limited mobility options, such as women, older adults, unemployed residents, and individuals without access to private vehicles. In peripheral and underserved areas, wetlands partially compensate for deficits in formal park provision, reducing accessibility gaps. These findings provide empirical evidence that urban wetlands function as grounded NbS by redistributing access to nature and underscore the importance of formally integrating wetlands into urban planning instruments to promote more inclusive and resilient cities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1038/s42949-026-00339-8", "doi": "10.1038/s42949-026-00339-8", "journal_full": "npj Urban Sustainability", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0161911105614696}, {"title": "AI-enhanced urban forecasting: ConvLSTM networks for multi-scenario land cover prediction in metropolitan regions", "authors": "Mohamed F.

This study develops a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) framework applied to a uniquely dense 39-year annual land cover dataset (1985-2023) across Colorado’s Metropolitan Planning Organization areas to address limitations in long-term spatiotemporal urban growth prediction. The framework integrates stakeholder-driven scenario planning to evaluate five alternative development trajectories ranging from business-as-usual to high-growth futures. Analysis reveals a counterintuitive “Temporal Depth Paradox” where prediction accuracy (F1 score) increases substantially from 0.27 for 1-year forecasts to 0.87 for 20-year forecasts, challenging fundamental assumptions in urban forecasting. The model effectively distinguishes between different development processes, showing higher predictive accuracy for greenfield expansion versus complex urban redevelopment. By embedding ecological constraints and evaluating alternative growth scenarios, the framework demonstrates how AI can support sustainable development goals while maintaining human oversight in planning processes. Quantitative scenario analysis reveals that compact development patterns (Adaptive Innovation scenario) produces 20.5% infrastructure efficiency improvements and preserve approximately 1,000 additional hectares of natural areas by 2050 compared to unregulated growth scenarios.

Findings reveal how centralized governance in Korea enables rapid implementation aligned with global frameworks, while Germany’s decentralized model prioritizes local autonomy and EU-level policy integration, often at the cost of slower decision-making. Sectoral analysis highlights differing priorities: government actors emphasize regulatory compliance and resources, NGO focus on participation and equity, and researchers stress evidence and long-term vision.

Little is known about whether this extends to children. To address this, we first conducted a computational analysis to quantify the relationship between the emotional properties of words and their contexts in a large corpus of stories written by children (N = 103,541; approximately 55 million word tokens, age 7-13 years). As predicted, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.46) between word and context valence, and this was stable across age. We then conducted a pre-registered word learning experiment to investigate how emotional narrative context shapes the learning of novel adjectives during independent reading. Children (N = 120, age 7-11 years, 59 girls) were presented with 15 novel words embedded in 30 short narratives of either neutral, negative, or positive valence. We found that children learned novel adjectives from their reading experience, and older children outperformed younger children in word recognition and valence judgment. Novel adjectives read in more emotional (positive or negative) contexts were recognised more accurately than those read in neutral narratives. Children inferred word valence from narrative context, demonstrating that context valence is an effective cue for word learning. We discuss how affective associations build from children’s experience of words in emotional contexts, consistent with affective embodiment supporting children’s learning of abstract concepts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/jmq2y_v2", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/jmq2y_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008316272758592147}, {"title": "Emotional similarity between personally-relevant photographs of negative world events", "authors": "Anastasiya Shulhan, Juliette Dupertuys, Coraline Rinn Iordan, Anna Fu, Nikoline Mekjan, Will Attwood, Ziyue Zeng, Gorana Pobric, Larysa Zasiekina, Deborah Talmi", "abstract": "The meaning of our experiences is informed by their emotional tone, but to what extent judging that events evoke similar emotions (“emotional similarity”) determines our perception that these events are similar to each other overall? To investigate this question, in two experiments, we solicited judgments of the similarity between pairs of photographs of major real-world events on several dimensions, including their emotional and overall similarity. Ratings of the emotionality of single photographs were also collected. Participants in Experiment 2 completed questionnaires that quantified trait anxiety and depression. Explicit judgements of emotional similarity predicted judgements of overall similarity better than single-stimulus judgments, an important methodological point which should inform future studies of this construct. Our findings suggest that perceived emotional similarity is highly predictive of how similar stimuli are perceived to be overall. Despite the high correlation among the facets of similarity between stimuli, emotional similarity had a unique explanatory power. Depression severity decreased the perceived similarity.

This working paper develops an integrated framework of hybrid epistemic authority to explain how organizational leaders construct professional credibility in environments driven by algorithms. Drawing on theories of epistemic authority, platform affordances, and professional self-branding, I conceptualize authority as simultaneously institutionally grounded and performatively achieved. The framework identifies eight interdependent dimensions: traditional competence, digital communication skills, strategic authenticity, contextual adaptivity, institutional embedding, strategic restraint, reactive authority, and emotional labor. Preliminary findings from interviews with eleven senior executives on their LinkedIn use reveal that authority construction requires continuous negotiation between competing necessities. These include authenticity versus optimization, visibility versus protection, and personal versus organizational identity. C-level leaders navigate these tensions through strategic practices that balance genuine expression with platform-specific performance demands. This framework contributes to scholarship on digital leadership, professional expertise, and platform governance by demonstrating that contemporary authority is no more solely possessed by credentials or defined by performance. Rather, it emerges out of a delicate interplay of communication and the sociotechnical constraints that we can’t control.

However, patients’ acceptance, which shapes technology use and compliance, is still insufficiently understood. Methods: In this study, we explore how perceived risks and perceived benefits relate to attributed value as a proxy for social acceptance. Unlike most studies that focus on individual technologies, we measure public perception of 20 very different types of health technologies—ranging from plaster cast and x-Ray to insulin pumps, bionic limbs, and mRNA vaccines. Through an online survey utilizing a convenience sample of 193 participants from Germany and Bulgaria, we assessed perceived risks, benefits, and overall value attributed to these technologies. The study presents a visual mapping of the technologies and investigates the individual and technology-related factors shaping these perceptions. Results: The findings suggest that perceived benefit is the strongest predictor for overall value (β = +0.886), while perceived risk plays a significant, but much smaller role (β = −0.133). Together, both factors explain 95% of the variance in overall attributed value (95%, R2 = .959).

Although scientific and technological advances and socioeconomic transformations have driven drug research and development, yielding substantial gains, critical scholarship has emphasized controversial practices of corporate influence - here synthesized as “Influence, Deviations, and Excesses” - that promote growth, profitability, and the consolidation of power, at times in conflict with the collective interest and public health. In this context, the present article adopts an exploratory-descriptive design and a mixed-methods approach, triangulating public datasets, institutional documents, and a critical review of the international literature to map and describe mechanisms of corporate influence in the pharmaceutical sector across eight axes: (i) lobbying and electoral financing; (ii) influence over regulatory and oversight bodies; (iii) influence on patient organizations; (iv) influence on the development of clinical guidelines; (v) manipulation, promotion, and concealment of pharmaceutical research and trials; (vi) ghostwriting; (vii) strategies of diagnostic expansion and disease promotion; and (viii) the funding and provision of benefits to prescribers and institutions, including psychosocial mechanisms and formative dimensions. The findings indicate that corporate influence is structured across multiple scales and operates in a manner that is simultaneously visible and diffuse. At the political level, lobbying and electoral financing emerge as central instruments for shaping the normative and regulatory environment, with a progressive expansion of investments. In the regulatory sphere, the recurrence of conflicts of interest in advisory committees and the circulation of personnel between agencies and companies suggest vulnerabilities to institutional capture, with implications for drug approval, oversight, and withdrawal processes. In the scientific domain, industry sponsorship is associated with biases that may affect everything from trial design and conduct to the selective publication of results, as well as practices such as ghostwriting and “market conditioning” strategies, undermining the credibility and circulation of evidence. In parallel, industry involvement is evident in diagnostic expansion and the medicalization of conditions of everyday life, enlarging markets and potentially obscuring social determinants and non-pharmacological approaches. In clinical practice, payments and transfers of value to prescribers and educational institutions are associated with shifts in prescribing patterns, increased costs, and preferential use of promoted drugs, including through low-value benefits mediated by cognitive biases.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rbysc_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/rbysc_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009749695901682842}, {"title": "Revisiting displacements—exploring the potential of the biographical approach for object data enrichment", "authors": "Mingshi Cui", "abstract": "This research offers original insights and critical reflection on the digital data enrichment of displaced museum objects, grounded in robust theoretical foundations from various interdisciplinary fields and empirical data from case studies.

This brings us to the topic of theorizing, as we argue that theorizing is an integral and fundamental part of engaging with problems. In this paper we develop an approach to theorizing for transformative collective action based on two key aspects: “Time”, building on Gilles Deleuze, and the “Complex We”, building on Marisol de La Cadena. As to the first, we explore how the past and future condition our understanding of problems, contrasting a linear, sequential view of time with a process-relational one where past and future are contracted in the present and are continuously reconfigured via processes of difference and repetition. As to the second, we introduce the \"complex we\", an emergent subjectivity as the agent of theorizing as that which supports reconfiguration of the past and the future. Together, these two aspects open up the transformative potential of socio-environmental problems beyond what could be conceptualized on the basis of linear time.

For example, increased GLP-1 advertisement exposure could make people more self-conscious about their own weight and physical appearance. It could also promote destigmatizing views toward those who use GLP-1 products for weight management. In a nationally representative survey of N = 1,000 US adults, we find that people exposed to higher levels of GLP-1 advertising tend to hold more negative views about their own weight and physical appearance.

Results: Significant regional differences were observed for Openness and Conscientiousness across most samples, with further multilevel analysis revealing significant gender/sex differences in these two traits.

Although this integrative paradigm has yielded valuable outcomes, it often frames disciplinary differences principally as barriers to be surmounted. Drawing on insights from science and technology studies (STS), this article advances an alternative epistemological framework by reconceptualizing disciplines not as repositories of accumulated knowledge but as historically stabilized methodological apparatuses that actively constitute explanatory objects and practices. Building upon this reconceptualization, the article develops an interventionist epistemology that positions disciplinary differences as generative epistemic resources rather than impediments. The proposed framework delineates a three-stage mechanism—interpretive juxtaposition, cognitive friction, and methodological reflexivity—whereby the deliberate and sustained co-presence of incommensurable explanatory logics disrupts the naturalized authority of any single disciplinary method, thereby fostering reflexive scrutiny of underlying epistemic commitments and normative implications. Through illustrative cases from climate policy modeling, management research, and evidence-based medicine, the analysis demonstrates how interpretive juxtaposition manifests across diverse institutional contexts, generating cognitive friction that prompts methodological reflexivity without necessitating premature synthesis or resolution of differences. These examples illustrate that prolonged exposure to plural explanatory regimes can productively intervene in epistemic assumptions, thereby reshaping the conditions of legitimate judgment and knowledge production. The article concludes by elaborating the implications of reframing interdisciplinarity as epistemic intervention rather than integration, and by identifying promising directions for future empirical inquiry within STS, including investigations into the institutional conditions that enable or constrain such reflexive dynamics.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubqh7_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ubqh7_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.004197405265159215}, {"title": "Spatial Changes in Kathmandu Valley: A review through political perspective", "authors": "Apil KC", "abstract": "Kathmandu valley’s spatial characters are constantly changing, and as such, its urban morphology can be observed as a frequently altered palimpsest. Developing on the trade route of Tibet and India, settlements of Kathmandu valley can be traced back to more than three thousand years. The foundation of the earliest settlements were laid out by Kirats in 300 BC or before that. The settlements expanded first under the succeeding Lichchhavi ruling house who applied Vedic town planning principles and later the Mallas expanded the settlements further with Astamatrika and Dashmahavidya concepts affiliated to Shakti- cult. After the unification of Nepal in 1769, Kathmandu Valley became the capital of politics, economy and administration, however the political centralization can be vividly observed only after the 1950's. After the dethroning of the autocratic Rana Regime in 1951, the monarchical government had the authoritative grip in government and development. The political turmoil did not stop until the 1990s, which brought two big changes in Nepal, when the re-establishment of Democracy and wave of globalization brought unprecedented change in the urban form of Kathmandu Valley. However, the democratization of Nepal did not go well; the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) declared a civil war that lasted for a decade till 2006 jeopardizing the baby local government (Decentralization) and causing massive migration to urban core from rural regions, especially to Kathmandu Valley. The mass movement of April 2006 changed the governing landscape, turning a democratic monarchical nation into a federal republic, with an expectation to loosen valley’s centripetal grip of economy and administration, if not politics.

The SOPs cover research ethics in a variety of fields, including veterinary medicine, public health, social sciences, natural sciences, agriculture, environmental sciences, business and economics, education and humanities, engineering and informatics. Despite being created for Wollo University, the SOP frameworks are widely applicable to African academic and research institutions. A unique and strong strength of the manual is the combination of the Ubuntu philosophy with a multidisciplinary approach, which advances beyond a simple compliance checklist to create a genuine ethical framework deeply integrated with the local context. Key features of the SOPs manual include: • An ethical framework grounded in Ubuntu philosophy, which emphasizes community interconnectedness and collective benefit as foundational principles guiding ethical review processes. • Customized, discipline-specific evaluation checklists that address the unique methodological and ethical considerations inherent to various research fields. • Comprehensive protocols that extend beyond human subjects research to encompass studies involving animals, plants, environmental systems, and communities, applicable across all academic units, reflecting a sophisticated understanding of contemporary research ethics. • The introduction of innovative procedures and tools for community impact assessment that respect indigenous knowledge systems and actively involve stakeholders. • Full alignment with international standards, including the Declaration of Helsinki and World Health Organization guidelines, while ensuring compliance with Ethiopian national regulations as stipulated in Proclamation No. 1130/2019. • Recognition of interconnectedness through the incorporation of concepts such as environmental stewardship, community impact assessment, and benefit-sharing, which are essential for fostering sustainable and ethical research practices. • Detailed implementation guidelines and training protocols designed to facilitate effective adoption and operationalization of the SOPs.

This article seeks to expand the idea of gender roles to the gendered nature of work experience as a result of gender-based occupational segregation. In doing so it synthesises an attempt to redraw the class map into a two-dimensional space divided by task structure and authority logic as a predictor of political attitudes with the literature on gender gaps. Is there a direct link between the attitudinal gender gaps and the gendered experience of work? Drawing on panel data and fixed effects estimation the causal nature of work experience is scrutinised. While previously noted differences in attitudes between different positions in the two-dimensional class scheme are (partly) observable, these differences largely cannot be attributed to a causal effect of work experience across different political attitudes. Rather, evidence points to the existence of personality-based selection into certain class positions and the stability of political attitudes irrespective of work experience.

However, this period of intense transition saw particularly strong growth, largely driven by unsustainable and impoverishing economic growth. On the other hand, this type of growth did not enrich the vast majority of Venezuelans. Thus, on the one hand, there was in fact the emergence of a virtuous circle and institutional plurality, which naturally lasted in the short term. Thus, the Chavista regime that later took hold in Venezuela largely promoted the significant emergence of vicious circles and a set of extractive institutions, strongly characterised by the very existence of economic destruction, promoted on the one hand by democratic stagnation. In this particular approach, I show some evidence that points to divergences regarding the plausible existence of abundant natural resources. Most countries that are rich in natural resources, for example, have similar characteristics, but are influenced, first by vicious circles, and secondly by the institutional extractivism existing in these countries. Examples such as Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Venezuela, Syria, Democratic Congo, and Congo Brazzaville reinforce the theory that abundance is primarily a promoter of political inconsistency, vicious cycles, and, above all, a large part of the multidimensional poverty that is significantly rooted in these countries in particular. Thus, during the vicious circle in Venezuela, on the one hand, the governmental incapacity promoted by the Chavista government consistently and continuously promoted the breakdown of social protection levels and, on the other hand, the significant increase of a significantly dual society, which is strongly persistent with non-inclusive and stagnant democracies. Democratic stagnation, however, was not economically and politically sustainable, and the marked differences consistently and plausibly led to the emergence of severe deprivation of freedoms, namely the deprivation of democratic freedoms and the deprivation of freedoms of access to basic needs.

With more and especially area-level constraints extreme errors in the SPM estimates begin to accumulate, and these are particularly pronounced for the low-frequency outcome.

Traditional voting mechanisms exacerbate these problems: binary choices, fixed option sets, and winner-take-all outcomes incentivize polarization rather than consensus-seeking. This paper introduces a deliberative framework designed to support meaningful participation at scale. The framework combines three innovations: (1) open and continuous proposal generation, allowing participants to introduce new alternatives throughout the process; (2) continuous preference expression on a scale from strong opposition to strong support; and (3) real-time aggregation using the Consensus Algorithm, which calculates scores as Mean − SEM (standard error of the mean), yielding a confidence-adjusted estimate of collective agreement that penalizes uncertainty and protects minority positions. Two proof-of-concept applications demonstrate the framework's practical viability. In the first, 53 participants converged on a single name from 26 proposals within approximately five minutes. In the second, 40 participants representing secular and religious perspectives jointly developed a social charter on religion-state relations over two sessions totaling 5 hours, achieving consensus above 60% on key provisions.

To address this gap, we systematically examine ethnographic evidence of female psychoactive substance use across 171 societies in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample. Using 1,397 drug-by-document cases identified in the Human Relations Area Files OCM category 276 (“Recreational and Non-Therapeutic Drugs”), we document (1) the prevalence of male and female drug use; (2) regional and subsistence variation; (3) substances most frequently associated with female use; and (4) the cultural contexts of women’s consumption, identified through text analysis and exploratory factor and cluster analyses. Findings reveal a robust cross-cultural pattern: women’s drug use is consistently less frequent and more culturally regulated than men’s. Gender disparities appear in every world region and subsistence system, though with varying magnitude in part due to the density of ethnographic reporting. Textual descriptions most often situate women’s use in low-dose, domestic, and socially embedded contexts.

Methods and data We conducted a systems-informed intervention development study following steps 1 and 2 of the 6 Steps in Quality Intervention Development framework (6SQuID), which define the problem and clarify modifiable factors. We facilitated co-production workshops using soft systems methods, including critical system heuristics, variable elicitation, multiple perspective diagrams, system mapping, priority setting, and six cohering questions.

The linked data included information on 6,608 drug-related deaths in Scotland between 2009 and 2018.

This scoping review synthesizes 88 studies to assess how transportation and hazards research has engaged equity and justice frameworks, what outcomes are used to evaluate inequity, where findings converge or diverge across hazards and disaster phases, and what conceptual gaps constrain progress. We find that the literature is effective at documenting disparities in exposure, evacuation, adaptation, and recovery, largely through population-based comparisons and novel mobility datasets. However, equity is most often treated implicitly, with unequal outcomes reported absent explicit normative or theoretical grounding. As a result, differences are frequently described without clarifying when and why they constitute inequities, limiting comparability across contexts and policy relevance. Evidence is strongest for inequities in transportation-mediated exposure, particularly for extreme heat and access loss driven by network failure, indicating a maturing understanding of transportation systems as active producers of vulnerability. Findings on evacuation disparities are less consistent, reflecting methodological limitations and contextual variation, while recovery outcomes show greater convergence, with marginalized communities experiencing slower or incomplete mobility restoration. Across domains, mismatches persist between commonly used mobility metrics and lived disaster needs, and mechanisms producing inequity—such as disinvestment, governance capacity, caregiving constraints, disability access, labor precarity, and information asymmetries—are often underexamined.

To identify the demographic and sociocultural factors underlying this change, we applied an epidemiological approach to cultural evolution, using a case-control design coupled with structural equation modeling (SEM). Ethnographic data from 176 married individuals across 62 villages were analyzed to assess the effects of demographic, alliance, religious, cosocialisation, and modernisation variables on the likelihood of impal marriage. The model fit was strong (CFI = 0.96, RMSEA = 0.04), revealing significant direct and indirect effects. Marrying an impal was positively associated with the number of marriageable impal and with arranged or strategically motivated unions but negatively associated with reported religious conflict between spouses. Indicators of modernisation such as schooling and infrastructure were non-significant. These results indicate that the decline of impal marriage reflects demographic contraction and the weakening of alliance-based strategies rather than a rejection of the cultural norm itself.

The delayed restructuring of BOTAŞ and the absence of a clear segmentation framework prevented the emergence of a well-functioning domestic market, constraining price formation and liquidity, and ultimately hindering Türkiye's hub potential. To address this structural gap, this study proposes a unique hybrid institutional pathway operationalized through a novel Dual-Ring Model. This model segments gas supply between a regulated Guardian Ring (for vulnerable consumers) and a market-based Competitive Ring, fostering traded liquidity and authentic benchmark pricing. Drawing on the \"second-best\" institutional approach and the principle of \"embedded autonomy\", the framework argues against full liberalization. The AggregateTR procurement mechanism coordinates strategic state bargaining power, notably leveraging the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover period, with transparent competitive allocation. Two original Structural Market Indicators (SSDI and TVR) monitor support targeting and traded liquidity. Scenario-based analysis demonstrates how disciplined segmentation and phased support recalibration, including the strategic release of Sakarya Domestic Gas Production into the Competitive Ring, progressively balance supply security, affordability, and benchmark credibility. This framework provides a resilient hybrid gas market architecture grounded in Türkiye's structural context, offering actionable insights for the critical 2026–2030 contract rollover window and the subsequent post-2030 market design.

Beyond scientific and technological advancements, productivity primarily hinges on workers' production enthusiasm and labour quality, the scale of production within each unit, and the pattern of resource allocation. Under given productive forces, the scale of production per unit is determined by the rate of exploitation imposed by owners upon labourers. As productive forces advance, new production models emerge. To boost productivity, the rate of exploitation diminishes, elevating the political and social standing of the populace, thereby giving rise to new social formations. Undifferentiated human labour constitutes the origin of goods value, while interest represents the outcome of value distribution. The risk-free rate approximates 20% of the average return on corporate assets. Goods prices in the market are primarily determined by supply, with the labour value of goods serving as the equilibrium point of supply—thus constituting the market's equilibrium price. The labour theory of value quantitatively explains the Equity Risk Premium Puzzle. The higher the automation level of enterprises, the lower the value of goods, and in the long run, the lower the profits of enterprises.

This study aimed to investigate the temporal evolution of groove perception and its neural correlates using electroencephalography (EEG). Participants listened to synthesized drum patterns varying systematically in syncopation complexity (low, medium, high) while EEG was recorded. After each rhythm, participants rated their subjective “desire to move” and “feeling of pleasure”. We analyzed the dynamics of middle frontal theta-band (4-8 Hz) power across four repetitions of the core rhythmic phrase and correlated this activity with behavioral ratings, complemented by sLORETA source localization. Behaviorally, results robustly confirmed the inverted U-shaped function, with medium syncopation eliciting the highest groove ratings. Neurally, middle frontal theta power paralleled this pattern, showing maximal amplitude for medium syncopation, particularly during later repetitions. Importantly, theta power during the 3rd repetition positively correlated with both desire to move and pleasure. Source analysis localized these significant correlations primarily to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC).

Further research should employ multilevel modelling to examine factor interactions and rigorously evaluate interventions targeting lifestyle factors and socioeconomic inequalities through randomised controlled trials and quasi-experimental designs.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/jex8p", "doi": "10.31219/osf.io/jex8p", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013437166917988796}, {"title": "The Concentration Mechanism: Male Partner Distribution Bifurcation and the Collapse of the Moderate Middle", "authors": "Joshua Konstantinos", "abstract": "The majority of the widely-discussed “sex recession” reflects a symmetric rise in virginity affecting both genders equally. A companion paper, however, documented an additional asymmetric component: a post-2012 widening of the male-female gap in sexlessness among the sexually experienced. This study investigates the distributional mechanism underlying that asymmetric gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). The analysis focuses on never-married, sexually experienced adults aged 25-34—old enough to have accumulated meaningful partner histories, young enough to reflect contemporary market dynamics, and restricted to those actively in the dating market; similar male-specific redistribution appears in broader sexually experienced samples, indicating the pattern is not driven solely by marital selection. Among this population, I find a male-specific collapse of the “moderate middle”: the share of men with 3-5 lifetime partners fell from 30.3% to 21.5% (-8.8 percentage points) between 2006-2010 and 2015-2017. This loss bifurcated: +4.4 pp shifted to the 1-2 category (exclusion) and +4.4 pp shifted to 6+ (concentration). Women’s distribution remained stable. The upper tail (10+ partners) actually declined slightly for both genders, suggesting concentration operates specifically in the 6-9 range—not through extreme accumulation. Because this redistribution occurs within the middle of the distribution rather than the extreme upper tail, it is poorly captured by standard inequality measures (e.g., Gini coefficients) and to analyses focused on top-end accumulation. This distributional pattern—middle collapse rather than upper-tail growth—has gone unrecognized in prior work. The asymmetric gap decomposes evenly into exclusion and concentration.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2epx8_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/2epx8_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.013126959700021978}, {"title": "Addressing Social Media Platforms’ Influence on Academic Research", "authors": "Raffael Heiss, Isabelle Freiling", "abstract": "Social media platforms play a central role in shaping today’s information ecosystem, yet access to both their internal data and even publicly visible content remains tightly restricted for academic researchers. This stands in sharp contrast to other industries such as food and pharmaceuticals where researchers can independently study product ingredients and effects. As a result, academic research on social media faces an unprecedented dependency on industry-controlled data, increasing the risk of bias and potentially distorting the evidence needed for effective regulation and policymaking. Drawing on research from other disciplines, we examine how industry influence operates and how researchers’ reliance on platforms for data may amplify industry influence. We identify four challenges in collaborations between researchers and social media platforms: restricted data access, selective funding, hard-to-detect influence, and institutional entanglements. These challenges risk undermining the independence and transparency of research in a field of growing societal relevance. Addressing these challenges requires policymakers to regulate data access, as illustrated by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), which mandates data access for vetted researchers while safeguarding user privacy. In addition, new independent funding mechanisms could help ensure that research agendas remain free from platform interests. In parallel, the social science community must adopt stronger ethical standards and invest in “research on research” to detect and mitigate potential biases in policy-relevant research. With a dual approach – policy reforms and critical academic debates – we can ensure that research on social media platforms serves the public interest rather than platform priorities.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ny2tx_v2", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ny2tx_v2", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005310435933346347}, {"title": "Social Inequalities in the Timing of Childcare Use in Europe", "authors": "Maximilian Reichert, Alzbeta Bartova, Tom Emery", "abstract": "This study examines when parents across Europe begin using formal childcare and how the timing of entry is socially stratified by socioeconomic resources, employment, and informal care availability. Childcare services are central to work–family reconciliation and gender equality. Existing research focuses primarily on whether families use childcare, largely overlooking when they do so. But timing matters because institutional entitlements only translate into real opportunities when households can convert them into use at specific points after childbirth. Using harmonized EU-SILC data from 22 European countries (2003–2020), this study estimates age-specific probabilities of formal childcare use during the first four years after birth. An analysis with matched longitudinal data complements thus study to assess the stability of childcare use once initiated. Formal childcare use rises steeply with child age but displays pronounced social stratification. Higher maternal education, stronger labor-market attachment, and higher household income are associated with substantially earlier entry into formal care. Informal childcare acts as a key substitute, delaying formal entry. Cross-national differences in usage levels and timing are large. Longitudinal results show that once families enter formal childcare, exit is rare. Inequality in childcare use is fundamentally temporal. Advantaged parents convert institutional entitlements into earlier and longer use, while less resourceful households enter later, reinforcing cumulative inequalities in employment trajectories and early childhood environments.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ju75w_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ju75w_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.019303028587554505}, {"title": "Sustainable Cultural Entrepreneurship of Lesvos: Long-Term Development based on the Island’s Competitive Features", "authors": "Maniou Fotini, Mitoula Roido, Karagianni Vilma, Manola Maria, Nentas Dimitrios, Ntalianis Klimis", "abstract": "This study explores cultural entrepreneurship in Lesvos, a Greek island with a significant cultural rich, and the perspective for cultural entrepreneurship is such isolated geographical areas to grow and lead a further economic, social, and cultural bloom.

Anchored in the framing theory and situated within a communication-centric analytic paradigm, the study utilizes semi-structured interviews to examine how macro-level discursive formations emanating from state, media, and institutional actors are translated into micro-level interpretive schemas through which marginalized subjects perceive economic deprivation, agency, and futurity. The analysis demonstrates that participants’ narratives are permeated by hegemonic frames of dependency, passivity, and moralized deservingness, which operate as symbolic constraints that delimit perceived economic agency and normalize structural exclusion. The study contends that communication functions not merely as a descriptive or mediating apparatus but as an infrastructural dimension of economic inequality itself, actively configuring the conditions of possibility for economic action. To deepen the paper’s theoretical portability, we introduce the Communicative Architecture of Governed Exclusion (CAGE) as a mid-range framework specifying how poverty is reproduced through 1) classification (what counts as poverty and who counts as poor); 2) access control (administrative and informational gatekeeping), 3) governance through discourse (moralized narratives of deservingness and dependency), and 4) exclusion effects (internalized passivity, “waiting orientation,” and self-limiting economic agency).

These questions are central to scholarship on contemporary electoral politics, which has linked the radical right’s rise to a new dimension of political conflict separating tolerant, globally minded voters from exclusionary, locally oriented ones. This cleavage, variously described as universalist–particularist, cosmopolitan–parochial, or globalist–nationalist, implies that collective identification is polarized along a global–local axis and helps drive political mobilization. Yet little is known about how different territorial identities compete with or reinforce each other, let alone how their configurations shape political preferences. Using latent class models and survey data from 35 countries, I find that most Europeans are pluralists, who identify across a range of territories and support mainstream parties. A subset of countries, however, exhibits a division between particularists, who emphasize proximal identities, and expansivists, who emphasize distal ones. Remarkably, both groups converge in their strong attachment to the nation. This division overlaps with educational and geographic divides and separates radical-right supporters from those of new left parties like the greens.

With the rise of social media, many argue that political communication has increasingly migrated to these platforms, overshadowing traditional venues like parliament. However, the interplay between social media and the parliamentary venue remains poorly underswtood, even though understanding this relationship is crucial for grasping behavior in both contexts. In this paper, I argue that agendas initiated on social media can find their way into parliamentary discussions. However, while discussion in parliament is among opposition actors’ prime means of confronting the government with its ideas, such discussions carry higher stakes for government actors, making parliamentary talk less cheap for them. This dynamic creates an unexpected opportunity: Government parties can leverage social media to initiate new agendas that opposition parties subsequently introduce into parliamentary debates. In contrast, opposition parties cannot similarly employ social media to force government responses in parliament. Utilizing an original dataset of over 5.5 million tweets by parties and politicians, 400,000 parliamentary questions, and 750,000 news articles from the United Kingdom and Denmark (2015–2022), I employ state-of-the-art automated content analysis techniques.

It argues that supply vulnerabilities extend beyond geological endowment and extraction, increasingly reflecting coordination failures across transnational value chains, particularly at midstream and downstream stages involving refining, processing, logistics, certification, and regulatory alignment. While existing scholarship has largely treated hydrocarbon corridors and critical mineral supply risks as separate domains, limited attention has been paid to corridor-based governance arrangements capable of coordinating extraction, transit, processing, and market access across Eurasia. The study adopts a qualitative, policy-oriented methodology combining conceptual analysis, review of institutional and policy frameworks, and an embedded case study of the Southern Gas Corridor (SGC). The SGC serves as an institutional reference to examine how geographically connected actors, including Central Asian producers, Azerbaijan, Türkiye, and European markets, have managed asymmetric interdependence through long-term cooperation, intergovernmental frameworks, and coordinated state and commercial participation. Building on these insights, the article develops a corridor-based governance perspective for Eurasian critical mineral supply chains. It conceptualizes the Eurasian Critical Minerals Corridor not as an existing institutional structure, but as an analytical framework for examining how variable-geometry cooperation can structure interdependence, reduce exposure to value-chain vulnerabilities, and support more resilient supply arrangements. In doing so, the article advances a governance-centered interpretation of critical mineral supply chains and demonstrates how institutional lessons from energy corridors can inform policy debates on critical mineral security and the political economy of the energy transition.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/exjsp_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/exjsp_v1", "journal_full": "(SocArXiv/OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.009703476382472487}, {"title": "Ökonomik des Journalismus 1: Positive Externalitäten, oder: Warum Journalismus wichtig ist", "authors": "Christian Wellbrock", "abstract": "Dieses Kapitel analysiert die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung des Journalismus aus ökonomischer Perspektive.

This study applies the I-PACE model (Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution) to explore the psychological and behavioral mechanisms underlying teachers’ dependence on generative AI. Using survey data from 1750 teachers, the study examines factors such as self-efficacy, need for cognition, mood regulation, positive affect, perceived usefulness, and cognitive absorption in shaping AI addiction. Findings indicate that cognitive absorption is the strongest predictor of AI dependence, while perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and positive affect contribute indirectly through reinforcement mechanisms. Notably, mood regulation and need for cognition do not significantly influence AI addiction, suggesting that AI engagement in education is driven more by functional efficiency than emotional dependence.

Drawing on interviews with key actors, computational analyses, and archival materials spanning AIR’s history (1956–2021), we examine how AI evolved from a discipline with weak organic evaluation into a field driven by benchmarking, a “formal” evaluation system that defines progress quantitatively as state-of-the-art accuracy on commercial tasks. We demonstrate that benchmarking came to dominate through an intricate symbiosis with deep learning: benchmarking rewards accuracy, which large-scale deep learning uniquely excelled at, while deep learning’s opacity made organic evaluation increasingly difficult. This symbiosis restructured the field organizationally, epistemically, and materially into a “monoculture” dedicated to scaling. While enabling breakneck progress, monoculture discouraged exploration of alternatives with different epistemic strengths.

Tigers are extirpated entirely from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, and are severely threatened in extant populations in Southeast Asia. Across the region, tiger farms have been established with the main intent of supplying tigers for consumer demand, e.g. tiger bone glue for medicine. Tiger farms are known to operate within Vietnam and within Nghe An province, the focal area of this study. We interviewed 16 former tiger farmers to understand how they obtained their tigers, how they farmed tigers, why they farmed tigers, why they stopped farming tigers, and their beliefs around environmental policy, tiger conservation, and tiger reintroduction. Tiger cubs were trafficked in from Laos and raised by the tiger farmers to adulthood, at which point the tigers were sold to other individuals who slaughtered the tigers for their parts. We found that most of our sample were aware that tigers are in decline globally, and extinct from Vietnam. Farming was perceived as “easy” and lucrative; however, our sample were no longer raising tigers due to fears of fines and jail time.
