[{"title": "Democratic Deepening or Elite Persistence? How Local Elites Adapt to Electoral Reform in Rural India", "authors": "ALYSSA R. HEINZE", "abstract": "Political decentralization is often undermined by elite capture of the local state. In unequal contexts, contemporary accounts highlight that local executives lack de facto political authority because they are sidelined by unelected elites. This article investigates one purported institutional remedy: direct elections. Direct elections are promoted as a tool of democratic deepening that empowers local executives by disrupting elites’ hold on political institutions. Exploiting a quasi-experiment in rural Maharashtra, India, I find that direct elections increase the de facto authority of local executives. However, I find no evidence of disrupted elite dominance. Instead, I argue that direct elections shift the mode of elite capture from informal to formal channels. I use over two years of qualitative fieldwork, original survey and administrative data, and a vignette experiment to substantiate these claims. This study underscores the limitations of reforms to bring democracy “closer to the people” in contexts of entrenched elite dominance.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/s0003055425101068", "doi": "10.1017/s0003055425101068", "journal_full": "American Political Science Review", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.005860355496430936}, {"title": "The Green Transition and Political Polarization Along Occupational Lines", "authors": "VINCENT HEDDESHEIMER, HANNO HILBIG, ERIK VOETEN", "abstract": "Green transition policies set long-term targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a threat to workers in polluting occupations and communities reliant on them.

The far-right AfD started campaigning as the only party opposing green transition policies in 2016.

Because such regions often have more developed economies and educated populations, paradoxically, this results in the opposite dynamics to that under democracy, where simpler speech is addressed at less educated, poorer constituents. Drawing on data from Russian governors’ major policy addresses and social media posts, and supplementing it with federal parliamentary speeches, we find that the linguistic complexity of elites reflects their audiences; elites also reduce it when their strategic context changes.

We leverage the policy change to compare 984 secondary students in schools that differ in their use of a diversity quota. We measure friendship with outgroup members, trust, tolerance, and national identity. Our findings indicate that national school students are more likely to have inter-ethnic friendships and are associated with a higher prioritization of civic national identity over subnational identities.

First, our conjoint experiments demonstrate a robust and strong relationship between undemocratic candidate behavior and dominance impressions.

Demand evasion occurs when the client avoids answering the security patron’s repeated demand on a strategic issue without provoking the patron’s punishment. There are three methods of demand evasion: stalling, deferring, and slow-rolling. To decide how to respond to their patron’s strategic demand, U.S. security clients assess the patron’s internal coherence regarding the demand and the type of risks involved in the issue at stake. I illustrate the theory of demand evasion by examining how three U.S. treaty allies in the Indo-Pacific (Australia, Japan, and South Korea) responded to demands from different U.S. administrations.

However, the promises may no longer be credible at very high levels of formal executive constraints, as excessive promises are often seen as ‘too good to be true’.

Our article examines the pivotal yet neglected intersection of women's leadership and allyship for gender equality. Across two experiments with community samples (total N = 801), we investigate how message framing (common cause vs. women's issue; Experiment 1), intergroup/male versus intragroup/female allies (Experiments 1–2), and transformative versus tokenistic allyship (Experiment 2) affect female leaders' capacity to mobilize both men and women for gender equality. We demonstrate that common cause (vs. women's issue) messages more readily mobilize men for collective action, whereas women's mobilization remains high irrespective of message framing. We also show that a female leader supported by an intergroup/male rather than an intragroup/female ally is more likely to be seen as “one of us,” have greater influence, and be more effective at mobilizing both men and women for collective action (Experiments 1–2). Critically, men are mobilized by transformative allyship (regardless of ally gender) and disengage from both the leader and the cause in response to tokenistic allyship (Experiment 2). While male allies can be important, our results suggest that transformative allyship is essential for mobilization across gender boundaries.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/pops.70084", "doi": "10.1111/pops.70084", "journal_full": "Political Psychology", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.015614851848602451}, {"title": "“We have nothing to do with it”: How statements of denial by armed actors shape public perceptions and emotions", "authors": "Ilayda B.

Existing research argues that armed groups publish denial statements to avoid public backlash, favorably frame the conduct of their campaigns, and distance themselves from unsanctioned actions conducted by rank‐and‐file members. However, the broader psychological impact of denial statements on public perceptions remains unexplored. Investigating the effects of denial statements published by armed groups, we conducted a novel survey experiment with a national sample of 1616 adults in the United States. Participants were presented with a fictional attack attributed to an armed group by the government and randomly assigned to conditions in which the group denied, claimed, or remained silent about the attack. Our findings reveal that denials reduce perceived culpability in attacks, undermine trust in government, and alter emotional responses to violence. These results highlight how denial statements may serve as important rhetorical tools in armed groups' discursive repertoire.

This seismic shift in the religious composition of the country precipitates important questions about the attitudes, group identity, and political participation of religious nones in response to contemporary issues. In this paper, we present the results of a novel survey experiment (N = 1,013) designed to determine if issue and identity cues increase religious nones’ sense of group identification, group consciousness, linked fate, and willingness to engage in political behavior. We leverage a unique large-scale sample of nonreligious Americans to facilitate these tests.

To do so, we employed Price’s theory of crip spacetime to illuminate how communicative disenfranchisement is magnified when the spaces that talk occurs in are disenfranchising themselves. Based on interviews with 20 disabled and chronically ill individuals, findings illustrate how ableism is enacted communicatively through epistemic erasure and spatially through (in)accessible environments. Findings also demonstrate how navigating multiple dimensions of disenfranchisement is costly, negatively affecting individuals’ physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. This disenfranchisement accumulates and leads to what we term illness burnout , which occurs when structural inaccessibility exhausts individuals from seeking the care they need.

Although hosted cultural production is commonly regarded as more autonomous and freer from formal gatekeepers, the continued pursuit of commercial ends maintains constraints of capitalism. The unlicensed relationship with circulation services may introduce greater autonomy in circulation practices in some regards but leaves media makers without the recourse enjoyed under complex-professional dynamics formalized in licensed arrangements.

However, prior research has predominantly focused on successful news sharing , overlooking the equally consequential behavior of deliberate news withholding. This study addresses that gap by proposing a self-presentation model of deliberate news withholding on social media, integrating three dominant approaches previously used to examine successful news sharing: (1) the informational approach focusing on the virality of news content, (2) the structural approach emphasizing social media network characteristics, and (3) the relational approach centered on users’ self-presentation and management of relationships with their audience. Specifically, this study combines two types of data: (1) survey data from 408 users and (2) a text analysis of news content they withheld in their three most active chatrooms. We examine how users selectively withhold news with varying levels of emotionality, argumentativeness, and hard or soft news value, depending on the characteristics of their audience networks – particularly network size and tie strength – and in relation to three self-presentational goals: self-construction, privacy protection, and audience-pleasing. Findings show that users strategically withhold varied types of news content across different user-audience networks to meet distinct self-presentational goals, thereby managing audience expectations and curating their online image.

While Internet researchers have become more careful in avoiding technologically deterministic arguments when assessing technologies’ general impact or their “effects,” crude claims about how technologies make their users feel persist, which I refer to as emotional technological determinism. More broadly, my research not only underscores the greater agency of users in this respect but also delineates the forms, scales, and scopes of feelings, sometimes contradictory, that technologies provoke, which technologies provoke what feelings, and for whom. Emotions themselves can be more or less agential, and the agency over how one feels when interacting with technology is distributed between technologies, users, and contexts.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1177/20563051251380042", "doi": "10.1177/20563051251380042", "journal_full": "Social Media + Society", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016247823110931203}, {"title": "Scrolling Through Chaos: The Implications of TikTok for Crisis Sensemaking", "authors": "Christy Khoury, Jeff Hemsley", "abstract": "This study explores the role of TikTok as a platform-based crisis information source, focusing on how users engaged in collective sensemaking during the 2020 Port of Beirut explosion.

The Determinants and Causal Effects of Admission to Highly Selective Private Colleges", "authors": "Raj Chetty, David J Deming, John N Friedman", "abstract": "We use anonymized admissions data from several colleges linked to income tax records and SAT and ACT test scores to study the determinants and causal effects of attending Ivy-Plus colleges (Ivy League, Stanford, MIT, Duke, and Chicago). Children from families in the top 1% are more than twice as likely to attend an Ivy-Plus college as those from middle-class families with comparable SAT/ACT scores. Two-thirds of this gap is due to higher admissions rates for students with comparable test scores from high-income families; the remaining third is due to differences in rates of application and matriculation. In contrast, children from high-income families have no admissions advantage at flagship public colleges. The high-income admissions advantage at Ivy-Plus colleges is driven by three factors: (1) preferences for children of alumni, (2) weight placed on non-academic credentials, and (3) athletic recruitment. Using a new research design that isolates idiosyncratic variation in admissions decisions for waitlisted applicants, we show that attending an Ivy-Plus college instead of the average flagship public college increases students- chances of reaching the top 1% of the earnings distribution by 50%, nearly doubles their chances of attending an elite graduate school, and almost triples their chances of working at a prestigious firm. The three factors that give children from high-income families an admissions advantage are uncorrelated or negatively correlated with post-college outcomes, whereas academic credentials such as SAT/ACT scores are highly predictive of post-college success.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjaf050", "doi": "10.1093/qje/qjaf050", "journal_full": "The Quarterly Journal of Economics", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.02618268022488046}, {"title": "Bargaining and Inequality in The Labor Market", "authors": "Sydnee Caldwell, Ingrid Haegele, Jörg Heining", "abstract": "We use novel surveys of firms and workers, linked to administrative employer-employee data, to study the prevalence and importance of individual bargaining in wage determination.

The findings confirm significant differences in the socioeconomic factors, economic dynamics, and development impacts across regular and irregular migration. The pattern of migration destinations also significantly varies across regular and irregular migration. Compared to regular migration, irregular migration costs are substantially higher, and its economic gains were considerably lower. Logit and Probit models confirm the significant role of dependency burden, education, and social networks in determining irregular migration. Remittance utilisation also diverges: irregular migrants primarily repay debts and sustain household consumption, whereas regular migrants invest in housing, social ceremonies, and enterprises.

Case narratives further underscore transitions between legal and irregular statuses, illuminating the fluidity and precarity embedded in contemporary migration regimes.

Drawing on neoclassical economic labour migration theory and the social protection theory, we built a foundation on how past integrational challenges increase the chances of return migration and the significance of CBPP as asafety net for migrant's accumulated social security. We conducted in-depth interviews with 28 Ghanaian migrants to examine how these past integrational challenges, which have already increased their chances of return, are compounded by the absence of a CBPP agreement, which causes a fear of losing their pension benefit on return. The study examines their experiences as they make such complex decisions towards their retirement. Our findings reveal that many migrants prolong their stay in the U.S. to obtain citizenship, which is essential for accessing pension benefits abroad without restrictions. This extended stay disrupts their retirement plans and compels them to extend their work life further to supplement their meagre pension benefit, which is a repercussion of their past low-paying jobs. Migrants face several challenges when deciding to leave the U.S. without acquiring citizenship. Those who choose to return to their home countries must visit the U.S. every six months to maintain their eligibility for benefits. This requirement can lead to significant costs, as they need to cover travel expenses and accommodations. As a result, a large portion of their benefits may be redirected to settle these conditions for their pension eligibility. This research contributes to the literature by highlighting how implementing CBPP could alleviate these burdens, enhance migrant well-being, and facilitate smoother transitions back to migrants’ home countries.

However, Black mothers are often at the forefront of numerous political movements, including ones to end police violence against Black Americans. Due to the disproportionality of police contact in Black communities, Black mothers have a personal stake in ending police abuse that is twofold. First, Black mothers are often victims of sexist and racist policing practices, facing verbal, sexual, psychological, and economic abuse at the hands of law enforcement. Second, while dealing with their own oppressive relationship with the police, they must simultaneously take action to protect their loved ones from potential violence and harm at the hands of the state. The goal of this research is to examine how community-based politics serve as an opportunity for Black maternal status to be manifested as a form of resistance. I focus on what I refer to as community-based political activity because it is deeply rooted in the fabric of Black women’s political activism and produces more immediate benefits than other forms of political engagement. To examine the effects of direct and indirect police encounters on Black mothers, I pose several questions: How does negative police contact affect Black mothers’ community-based political activity? Does this difference apply to Black women who are not mothers? Using data from the 2020 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Elections Survey, my analysis demonstrates that maternal status has a significant impact on Black mothers’ community-oriented political engagement, particularly for those affected by indirect police contact.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1017/rep.2025.10034", "doi": "10.1017/rep.2025.10034", "journal_full": "Journal of Race Ethnicity and Politics", "specialized": true, "preprint": false, "score": 0.018869186237171043}, {"title": "Accountability without accounting: missing and inconsistent labeling of refugee and asylee students in state datasets", "authors": "Fiza Mairaj, Toni Templeton", "abstract": "The United States’ refugee resettlement program is one of the oldest and largest government-sponsored resettlement programs globally, and children below the age of 18 comprise a large proportion of those resettled.

Based on 26 in‐depth interviews and participant observations conducted at a Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) in Jaffa, the study employs an interpretative analysis to explore the intersections of gender, migration, and conflict. The central argument is that wartime remittances reflect a complex and ambivalent phenomenon: while migrant women express deep national solidarity by channelling their earnings across multiple levels of obligation—including close family members, local communities, and the broader national cause—they simultaneously voice strong mistrust towards the Ukrainian state, rooted in long‐standing public perceptions of systemic corruption. In this context, remittances function both as expressions of moral commitment and as critiques of institutional failure.

Using rich sociological data from nearly 6 million scientific publications, we document a marked shift in team leadership from Western countries to China. In particular, the share of team leaders involved in U.S-China scientific collaborations that were affiliated with Chinese institutions grew from 30% of the total in 2010 to 45% in 2023. We further explore the implications of China’s rise by forecasting when Chinese scientists are projected to achieve parity in leadership vis-à-vis the United States, including in 11 critical technology areas that are focal points of technological development, and by analyzing how a potential decoupling of U.S.-Chinese science might affect Chinese scientific leadership.

A common example of human searching is performed by taxi drivers looking for passengers in a city. Here, we analyze GPS data of taxi drivers in three major cities over different time periods and find that when drivers search for passengers, the higher is their efficiency, the slower is their searching, and they tend to make more short-distance turns during the search. Our study further indicates that individuals are characterized by a specific level of efficiency, and thus, efficient drivers are consistently efficient across different days as they follow their own search strategies. Interestingly, only about 10% of drivers adopt the most efficient strategy, earning nearly 20% more than the average driver.

Genomic analyses highlighted enrichment of ARG-carrying pathogens, particularly Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas , with mobile genetic elements and oxidative stress responses as key contributors.

Yet most research studies a single platform—typically X/Twitter, or occasionally Facebook—leaving little known about the broader social media landscape. Here, we shed light on patterns of cross-platform variation in the high-stakes context of news sharing. We examine the relationship between user engagement and news domains’ political orientation and quality across seven platforms: X/Twitter, BlueSky, TruthSocial, Gab, GETTR, Mastodon, and LinkedIn. Using an exhaustive sample, we analyze all (over 10 million) posts containing links to news domains shared on these platforms during January 2024. We find that news shared on platforms with more conservative user bases is significantly lower quality on average. Turning to engagement, we find—contrary to hypotheses of a consistent “right-wing advantage” on social media—that the relationship between political lean and engagement is strongly heterogeneous across platforms. Conservative news posts receive more engagement on platforms where most content is conservative, and vice versa for liberal news posts, consistent with an “echo platform” perspective. In contrast, the relationship between news quality and engagement is strikingly consistent: Across all platforms examined, a given user’s lower-quality news posts received higher average engagement, even though higher-quality news is substantially more prevalent and garners far more total engagement across posts. This pattern holds when accounting for poster-level variation and is observed even in the absence of ranking algorithms, suggesting that user preferences—not algorithmic bias—may underlie the underperformance of higher-quality news.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2425739122", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2425739122", "journal_full": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.007707234489176762}, {"title": "Proximity to explosive synchronization determines network collapse and recovery trajectories in neural and economic crises", "authors": "UnCheol Lee, Hyoungkyu Kim, Minkyung Kim, Gabjin Oh, Pangyu Joo, Ayoung Park, Dinesh Pal, Irene Tracey, Catherine E.

When perturbed, however, rapid deviations from, and prolonged recovery to, criticality can severely disrupt these systems. The nature of such transitions depends on a system’s intrinsic phase transition type. Most systems in nature undergo continuous (second-order) transitions, but some approach a discontinuous, first-order transition known as explosive synchronization (ES). Systems nearer to first-order transitions are more unstable, losing criticality more rapidly and recovering more slowly. However, no existing method can directly determine from empirical data how close a system is to a first-order regime, limiting our ability to predict criticality transition patterns. Here, we introduce a physics-based framework that estimates a network’s ES proximity at the critical point. Using modified Stuart–Landau oscillator networks, we show that distinct critical dynamics emerge depending on the proximity to ES and that this measure predicts the temporal patterns of collapse and recovery under perturbations. We validated the generality of our computational findings with empirical data on network collapse and recovery, using human electroencephalogram recordings during general anesthesia and global stock market indices from 39 countries during the 2008 economic crisis. We demonstrated that rapid collapses and prolonged recoveries in both brain and stock market networks can be systematically predicted for neuronal and economic crises.

Second, it identifies four challenges that volatility poses for implementation collaborations and shows that collaborations in different settings can combine the practices in distinct ways to address each challenge. Local conditions thus may matter less for building resilience than how collaborations combine practices. Third, it uncovers a new reflexive practice—collaborative assessment and adjustment—likely to be particularly useful to build resilience in volatile environments.

One of the regulatory challenges in these contexts lies in preventing people from making dishonest claims to win such competitions. Honesty pledges, asking people to commit to ethical behavior ex ante, have been found to reduce cheating under non‐competitive settings (when rewards were given based on individual reports only). However, as people behave differently under competitive settings, it is unclear whether honesty pledges could be effective and recommended in such situations as well. In four experiments, we apply honesty pledges to competitive and non‐competitive settings, finding that pledges remain effective in reducing cheating behavior under competitive contexts (Studies 1–4). Moreover, this effect is not crowded out if a sanction (fine) is added to the honesty pledge (Study 2). Honesty pledges are also effective among people who tend to cheat more, due to low or overestimated task‐related ability (Study 2) or due to high competitiveness (Study 3). Additionally, people's estimations regarding others' cheating behavior explain why pledges accompanied by descriptive honesty norms affect cheating behavior (Study 3). Lastly, even in high‐stakes competitive environments that demonstrably increased dishonesty, honesty pledges remained effective in reducing dishonesty (Study 4). These findings demonstrate that honesty pledges can serve as effective non‐coercive regulatory instruments to reduce dishonesty in competitive environments, offering advantages over traditional enforcement mechanisms while remaining effective even among individuals most prone to cheating and under high‐stakes conditions, with important implications for organizational policy design and regulatory approaches.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70099", "doi": "10.1111/rego.70099", "journal_full": "Regulation & Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.0054171355153337375}, {"title": "The Governor's Dilemma and Regime Complexity: Diversification and Differentiation", "authors": "David Hagebölling", "abstract": "States, firms, and other types of governors routinely rely on intermediaries to govern issues on their behalf.

Diversification creates competition among intermediaries providing similar competencies to prevent drift and slack.

Concepts such as “just transition” and “sustainable welfare” have gained prominence as normative frameworks capturing these interconnections. However, despite the increasing scholarly attention, several important theoretical, conceptual, and empirical gaps remain, particularly regarding how social and ecological spheres intersect across different political systems. This Special Issue contributes to this debate by exploring the complex policymaking dynamics underlying eco‐social policies. Before presenting the contributions, this introductory article provides a thorough review of existing studies on eco‐social policies. The review serves a dual purpose: first, it synthesizes existing knowledge, identifying key gaps; second, it allows us to develop a comprehensive framework to understand eco‐social policymaking, based on a political system or systemic approach. This framework conceptualizes eco‐social policies as the output of a process driven by escalating eco‐social risks and concerns. Citizens' attitudes and voting behavior regarding social and environmental policies serve as the initial inputs that shape policy outputs. Within this system, eco‐ and welfare regimes represent the broader institutional contexts in which political parties and organized interest groups compete to find solutions to eco‐social conflicts and eventually supply eco‐social policies.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1111/rego.70048", "doi": "10.1111/rego.70048", "journal_full": "Regulation & Governance", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.016720656113302312}, {"title": "Correction to: From Language to Self-Identification: Indigenous Classification in the Americas", "url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/sf/soaf191", "doi": "10.1093/sf/soaf191", "journal_full": "Social Forces", "specialized": false, "preprint": false, "score": 0.2800049160258701}, {"title": "The political landscape of death: state policy polarization and mortality among Black and White Americans", "authors": "Anneliese N Luck", "abstract": "A growing body of macrostructural work examines the health impact of America’s polarizing state policy landscape.

Findings show that mortality increases among all groups as state policies shift rightward, peaking in early adulthood (ages 25–49).

Findings reveal positive associations between mortality and conservative shifts across all age groups and causes of death with varying race-sex patterns. Young adult mortality (ages 25–49), as well as HIV/AIDS and drug overdoses identified as primary contributors to the observed race-sex gradient, while homicide and cardiovascular disease are key contributors for White men and women, respectively. Finally, I argue that the consequences of policy polarization must be understood not only as the increase in mortality (excess deaths) associated with conservative policy shifts, but also as the decrease in mortality (averted deaths) associated with liberal policy shifts.

Drawing on a literature review of utility regulation theory, financial mechanisms, and empirical evidence, the study synthesizes theoretical foundations including natural monopoly theory and the regulatory compact with practical regulatory considerations. A detailed hypothetical case study included as appendix demonstrates how a $25 million extraordinary cost would be recovered under each method, providing complete mathematical calculations, customer bill impacts across residential, commercial, and industrial classes, and total cost comparisons over recovery periods ranging from three months to twenty years.

The paper emphasizes that transparent modeling, reproducible calculations, and meaningful public engagement are essential for regulatory legitimacy.

This study addresses that gap by analysing migrants’ inclusion as party executives, concentrating on state-level executive committees of German parties, which oversee day-to-day operations and hold substantial power. Examining how accessible these positions are to minority group members is key to understanding broader political inclusion dynamics. How prevalent are migrants in party executive positions, and under what conditions do they attain them? Leveraging multiple original data sources—a unique large-N dataset covering all state-level executive committees across six parties, qualitative interviews and a survey with party executives, and party documents—this study investigates the influence of three party-level factors. First, party ideology matters. Left-leaning parties are generally more likely to have party executives of migrant origin, while surprisingly the radical right has more than expected and the radical left fewer. Second, intra-party structures play an important role. Among left-wing parties, migrant sections help empower their members to reach leadership positions. In other parties, such sections either do not exist or serve different purposes. Third, parties do not appear to strategically select migrants for the party executive to attract new members. In sum, this study highlights how left-wing parties, for ideological reasons, are especially committed to including migrants in high-level executive positions, and how organisational structures shape this process.

This study investigates how the income, level of education, and class within cohabiting couples in the Netherlands, shape their support for right-wing populism through three diverse predictors, ranging from behavioural to attitudinal: voting for right-wing populist [RWP] parties, aim to vote for RWP parties, and sympathy towards RWP parties. Four models are tested to explain these relationships: male dominance, sharing, individual, and economic dominance models. Based on previous studies focusing on non-RWP parties, I expected the individual model for men and the sharing model for women to provide the best fit. Using data from the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences, this paper utilises diagonal reference models [DRM], for men and women separately, to trace the relative influence of the respondent and their partner on their RWP support. As far as I know, DRM has never been used to predict support for RWP parties. As expected, gender differences are evident. However, the data show, contrary to expectation, that the sharing model provides the best fit for men, while the individual model provides the best fit for women when it comes to income and education. Regarding class, as expected, the sharing model provides the best fit for women. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the diverse characteristics of the economic standing predictors and the different facets of RWP support tested.

Labeling as a media literacy strategy and policy intervention has gained momentum, but what impacts do synthetic content labels have on the public? We run two online experiments to measure the effect of content labeling on perceptions of political images—their perceived provenance, veracity, and engagement intention. We find that AI labels effectively communicate content provenance, significantly reducing perceived human involvement in image creation regardless of whether images were actually AI-generated. At the same time, labels have no impact on perceived veracity or self-reported engagement intentions. In a follow on study, we find limited evidence of the \"implied authenticity effect,\" whereby exposure to labeled synthetic images increases the perceived human provenance of subsequent unlabeled synthetic images. However, we show that the near-zero total effect is the result of two offsetting pathways: exposure to labeled synthetic images implies subsequent unlabeled synthetic images are more authentic, but this effect is countered by an increased skepticism caused by prior exposure to labeled content.

We then measure key empirical quantities and estimate the parameters in our model using a comprehensive, security level dataset of global corporate debt issuance which covers firms in 41 countries.

German respondents substantially overestimate the scale of Chinese investment—believing it accounts for about 30% of total inward FDI, compared to an actual share of roughly 1%—and evaluate it significantly less favorably than investment from other EU countries or the United States. In contrast, Chinese respondents express consistently positive views of German FDI, revealing a pronounced asymmetry in mutual perceptions. To probe the origins and malleability of these views, we implement three randomized interventions in Germany: a factual correction of actual FDI shares and two narrative framings emphasizing either positive or negative aspects of Chinese investment. While factual information modestly improves perceptions of FDI’s economic benefits, none of the treatments meaningfully shift deeper, ideologically anchored attitudes toward Chinese investment. Quantile treatment effect analyses indicate, however, that these interventions reduce anti-China biases among respondents who are initially more receptive to Chinese FDI.

Despite extensive research on overdose and prescribing risk, few studies have quantified the cost burden of opioid use or examined how policy and community-level factors jointly shape it. Objective: This study develops an interpretable, machine-learning framework integrating PBM cost levers and SDOH indicators to predict and explain county-level variation in opioid-related spending from 2013–2023. The goal is to identify structural drivers of cost, simulate potential savings under policy and social interventions, and support data-driven resource allocation. Methods: Using CMS Medicare Part D data linked with County Health Rankings and U.S. Census indicators, a Random Forest regression model was trained on ten years of county-level data (≈3,000 counties, 2013–2023). Key predictors included unemployment, income ratio, obesity, smoking, provider density, and PBM variables such as cost per claim and opioid prescribing rate. Model interpretability was achieved through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis and policy simulations testing both PBM and SDOH interventions. Results: The model achieved high predictive accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97), explaining nearly all observed variation in opioid cost per capita. SHAP analysis revealed unemployment, mental-health-provider density, and income inequality as dominant drivers, while provider access and preventive-care variables exerted cost-mitigating effects. Simulated PBM levers (e.g., formulary tightening, utilization management) reduced predicted costs by 4–6%, while integrated SDOH improvements (e.g., +20% behavioral-health access, +10% primary care) achieved up to 17% savings—equivalent to approximately $23 billion nationally. The combined model demonstrated both statistical robustness and policy relevance. Conclusion: This study reframes the opioid crisis through an economic and structural lens, demonstrating that predictive modeling can translate public-health and PBM data into actionable fiscal insights. The proposed PBM–SDOH integration provides a scalable, transparent framework for targeting interventions in high-burden counties, optimizing healthcare spending, and informing evidence-based opioid policy.

This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of social assistance distribution by the Aceh Social Service by assessing targeting accuracy, timeliness, accuracy of amount, and distribution efficiency. A qualitative descriptive approach was employed, collecting data through interviews with relevant staff and documentary studies of the 2024 social assistance distribution. The results show that the realization of PKH and BPNT distribution ranges between 91% and 93%, targeting accuracy reaches approximately 92%, and timeliness achieves 100%. However, disparities exist among districts/cities, alongside limitations in transparency and accountability that hinder the detection of irregularities. The findings imply the need for regular updates of recipient data, capacity building in low-achieving areas, diversification of distribution channels, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation systems to enhance the effectiveness and transparency of social assistance distribution in the future.

This study aims to propose the Internationality Index (IdI) and test its applicability in a case study, revealing critical gaps in institutional data availability of a Research Center (RC), the \"Dr. Eduardo J. Usunoff\" Plain River Hydrology Institute (IHLLA) in Argentina, from 2010 to 2018. It introduces and applies the composite Internationality Index (IdI) to assess institutional performance across education, publication, and financing dimensions. Design/Methodology/Approach. The research employed a documentary analysis using IHLLA’s annual institutional reports (2010–2018) and publicly available data. The IdI was constructed from three subindices: International Education Index (IEI), International Publication Index (PI), and International Financing Index (IFI). Due to limitations in explicit reporting, the final analysis relied on adjusted budget figures for financing, raw publication counts, and formal foreign degree attainment among research personnel for education. Results/Discussion. Data analysis revealed moderate international engagement in terms of research personnel training, with 41% of scholars and researchers holding a foreign degree. However, inconsistent reporting, a lack of systematic documentation on short-term mobility, and the absence of journal quartile classification in institutional reports constrained a complete longitudinal IdI calculation. The findings underscore the gap between the need for robust evaluation tools and the availability of standardized institutional data. Conclusions. The IdI is a viable tool for longitudinal analysis and strategic decision-making, but its effectiveness is severely limited by inconsistent institutional reporting of international variables. RCs must adopt systematic metrics to accurately capture internationality, particularly in international short-term training, international financing and publication quality, to enable effective monitoring and strategic improvement.

We examine the level of completeness of death counts in the Colombian vital registration records relative to those in the Census 2018. Our aim is to estimate the bias caused by under-registration of deaths, and how this bias varies across age and ethnicity. Methods We use data from the 2018 National Population Census and 2017 Vital Registration System from Colombia. Under-registered deaths by ethnic groups were estimated using two methods. First, we compared the number of deaths in the census with those in the mortality records. Second, we fitted a logistic regression model to estimate the relationship between mortal- ity under-registration and ethnicity, using a census variable indicating whether a death in the household was registered or not. Results A comparison of census and vital registration data indicates that the majority of deaths to both Indigenous and Afro-descendent households were not registered. Indigenous under- registration was considerably higher, with 77.8% of deaths reported in the census not captured in the vital registration system. The probability of under-registration remains high among the Indigenous and Afro-descendent population, even after adjusting for household characteristics. Conclusions Vital registration data in Colombia severely underestimate the deaths to Indigenous and Afro- descendants, reinforced by a clear geospatial patterning which correlates with the distribution of ethnic populations.

Marcuse’s supplement to the social psychology of authoritarian politics is presented in Eros and Civilization (1964), through the theories of surplus repression and regressive de-sublimation, which explain how discontent with civilization can be mobilized by authoritarian personalities to wider their support base. These theories supply the key to understanding the rancorous atmosphere of rightwing populism, authoritarian resentment and aversive prejudice now politically resurgent around the world on the Far Right.

The Role of Policy Design and Implementation", "authors": "Cha, Youngjoo, Kristin Kelley, Elizabeth Hirsh", "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between flexible work policies (e.g., time-off, flextime, working from home), workplace culture, and employee work outcomes. Drawing on an original survey of 4,013 employees from a national probability sample of U.S. households, we find that “ideal worker norms,” which emphasize a single-minded commitment to work, largely persist across U.S. work organizations, including those that offer flexible work policies. However, in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented under certain conditions—namely, gender-neutral framing, transparent guidelines and granting processes, easy access, and strong managerial support—employees are less likely to associate “successful employees” with ideal worker characteristics and less likely to view using flexible work policies as a career limiting move. Employees in these conditions also report higher self-assessed job fit, promotion prospects, and job satisfaction, and lower turnover intentions compared to employees in organizations where flexible work policies are implemented in more feminized, discretionary, less accessible, and less supportive conditions. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of flexible work policies depends on their design and implementation, not merely their availability, and that when implemented effectively, these policies can improve workplace culture and employee work outcomes.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/c6fp9_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/c6fp9_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.008054840073990155}, {"title": "Zizek’s Critique of the Authoritarian Personality", "authors": "Geoff M Boucher", "abstract": "Lacanian psychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek provides the theoretical tools for rethinking the concept of the authoritarian personality originally developed by Theodor Adorno and cothinkers in the period 1936-1951.

Using Danish register data 13283 teachers who graduated between 1980 and 1985, I employ sequence analysis and cluster analysis to map out teacher career paths over 35 years.

Further, the analysis reveals that teacher career paths are highly stable. Once teachers begin their careers in a particular type of school, they tend to remain in that type throughout their careers. This contradicts the theoretical expectation that teachers would switch schools or types of schools as they gain experience. Lastly, teacher characteristics such as high school GPA, gender, and age at graduation show weak associations with the type of career path teachers follow.

By strengthening social capital, expanding access to decent employment, and ensuring equitable development outcomes, the results of this study offer a strategic foundation for reducing crime rates while improving the quality of life in Aceh through enhanced public safety, social stability, and sustainable well-being.

Based on data from 23 regencies/municipalities, the findings reveal that both education and poverty jointly have a significant effect on crime. However, only poverty shows a statistically significant partial effect (p = 0.0524), with a negative coefficient, while education does not have a statistically significant influence (p = 0.9654). The adjusted R² value of 63.64% indicates that the model provides a strong explanation of the variance in regional crime rates. The counterintuitive result regarding poverty suggests that in the context of Aceh, strong social cohesion and religious norms may mitigate the criminogenic effects of economic hardship. These findings imply that crime prevention strategies must go beyond economic indicators and incorporate local socio-cultural dynamics. Policy recommendations include implementing context-based educational reforms, promoting community-driven poverty alleviation programs, and fostering cross-sectoral collaboration among education, social welfare, and public security stakeholders.

While there are measures that examine the multifaceted nature of creativity, comprehensive measures that holistically assess creativity remain underdeveloped. This study developed the Creative Personality and Thinking Styles Scale (C-PETS), which measures personality, thinking styles, and creativity-related motivation. Based on the investment theory of creativity, the scale focuses on the aforementioned three elements that can be measured using psychological scales. Methods: The initial C-PETS item pool was developed by Psychology-related field experts with doctorates, who referenced existing scales that measure creativity-related concepts. Exploratory factor analysis using maximum likelihood extraction with Promax rotation was conducted to examine the underlying factor structure. Results: Exploratory factor analysis involving 572 participants yielded a five-factor, 16-item scale comprising “broad thinking,” “thorough thinking,” “information manipulation,” “challenge pursuit,” and “ambiguity tolerance.” Confirmatory factor analysis involving 944 participants showed a good fit (CFI = .95, RMSEA = .05), and the higher-order model was also supported. Examination of construct validity revealed significant correlations with the Creative Self-Efficacy Scale (r = .75), Aesthetic Experience Scale (r = .30), and Diffuse Association Test (r = .18). Additionally, a positive correlation was observed with educational background, indicating that the C-PETS effectively measures the multifaceted nature of creativity. Conclusions: The C-PETS represents a valuable contribution to creativity assessment by providing a comprehensive measure of creativity-related personality traits, thinking styles, and motivational factors.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/m73rv_v3", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/m73rv_v3", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.00755885219577801}, {"title": "The Good, the Bad, and the Bumpy: Evaluating the Surface roughness Accuracy of Molding Compounds for Lithic Use-Wear Analysis.", "authors": "Alice Rodriguez, Radu Iovita", "abstract": "The replication of microscopic surface features on stone tool edges using molds and casts is the only way to carry out use-wear analyses on certain lithic artifacts which cannot fit under a microscope or leave a museum. They are also very important for preserving wear stages in sequential experiments aiming to understand wear formation processes. However, the reliability of these methods for replicating micro-topographic features remains insufficiently explored. This study assesses the fidelity of three impression materials—Genie, President, and Affinis—on chert, dacite, obsidian, and quartzite tools, focusing on surface roughness replication for high-resolution analytical techniques such as confocal microscopy. Using Sensofar S-Neox microscopy, ceramic bead georeferencing, and Number of ISO 25178-based roughness parameters, we evaluated the precision and consistency of each material. Statistical analyses demonstrate that Genie replicated surface features with greater fidelity on dacite and obsidian, while President performed similarly on flint and quartzite. Among the evaluated parameters, Str (Texture aspect ratio), Smr1 (Peak material portion), and Sal (Autocorrelation length) varied the least and thus offered the highest replication quality. This research highlights the importance of selecting replication materials suited to the specific properties of the analyzed artifacts and the requirements of the applied analytical techniques. By providing a systematic framework for evaluating replication fidelity, this study contributes to improving methodological precision in use-wear studies and facilitates the application of advanced imaging technologies to archaeological research.", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r28yt_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/r28yt_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.011199571612543036}, {"title": "Beyond Skill Training: Teaching Social Work 'Rituals' Through Large Language Model (LLM) Simulated Role-Play", "authors": "Gerard Chung, Pak-Hang Wong, Johnson Chun-Sing, Cheung, Jeric Yim, Sophie Cheng, Darren Tay, Zheng Liren", "abstract": "This teaching note presents a pedagogical framework for integrating Large Language Model (LLM)-powered role-playing tools into social work education that moves beyond skills- focused approaches to incorporate relational and embodied dimensions of practice. Using SWAT:Role Play, a text-based simulation tool where students engage with simulated service user personas, we propose pedagogical design considerations for LLM role-playing. While features like unlimited practice opportunities, immediate feedback, and systematic assessment align with Deliberate Practice models, student testing revealed recognition of the absent \"human touch\" essential to professional practice. Drawing on concepts of technology-driven moral deskilling (Wong, 2024), we argue that designing simulation tools primarily around skill acquisition risks fragmenting social work practice into isolated components, negating the structured immersion into holistic professional practice that social work demands. To address this challenge, we propose \"ritualizing the machine\" through intentional design principles that develop students' \"ritual fluency,\" their ability to navigate complete client encounters with appropriate relational and contextual responsiveness. We suggest teaching strategies including pre-session visual context and ritual preparation, during-session temporal pressure and boundary challenges, and post-session reflection on relational impact. These recommendations help social work educators use LLMs to simulate role-playing that effectively integrates technical competence with relational sensitivity", "url": "https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ve762_v1", "doi": "10.31235/osf.io/ve762_v1", "journal_full": "(OSF Preprints)", "specialized": false, "preprint": true, "score": 0.005863013973905429}]
