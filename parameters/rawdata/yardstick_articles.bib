The authors argue that migration is driven not solely by economic or social determinants; rather, the political environment across destinations plays a substantively large role in influencing bilateral migration flows. They test the importance of the political environment---citizenship rights and the prominence of right-wing parties---using data on migration flows from 178 origin countries into 18 destination countries over the period 1980--2006. They find, even after controlling for a variety of economic, social, policy, and international variables, that variation in political environments across time and destination plays a key role in observed patterns of international migration.},

Nevertheless, three groups of states display distinct modes of immigration politics. Divergent immigration histories mold popular attitudes toward migration and ethnic heterogeneity and affect the institutionalization of migration policy and politics. The English-speaking settler societies (the United States, Canada, and Australia) have histories of periodically open immigration, machineries of immigration planning and regulation, and densely organized webs of interest groups contesting policies. Their institutionalized politics favors expansionary policies and is relatively immune to sharp swings in direction. Many European states (France, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Belgium) experienced mass migration only after World War II and in a form that introduced significant non-European minorities. Their immigration politics is shaped by what most see as the unfortunate consequences of those episodes and are partially institutionalized and highly volatile and conflictual. European states until recently sending countries (Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece) deal with migration pressures for the first time in their modern histories, under crisis conditions, and in the context of intensifying coordination of policies within the European Union. We should expect the normalization of immigration politics in both sets of European states. Although they are unlikely to appropriate the policies of the English-speaking democracies, which should remain unique in their openness to mass immigration, their approach to immigration will, nevertheless, take the liberal democratic form.},

                   of immigration control in advanced market economy
                   countries after World War II. Immigration control can
                   be distinguished from the broader concept of
                   immigration policy by its emphasis on state policies
                   that define the permissible level of resident alien
                   admissions. The analysis is based on the
                   well-established fact that immigrant communities are
                   geographically concentrated. I argue that this
                   geographic concentration creates an uneven
                   distribution of costs and benefits, providing a
                   spatial context for immigration politics. In this
                   context, net public demand for tighter immigration
                   control increases in localities where immigrants
                   concentrate when those areas experience higher
                   unemployment, rapid increases in immigration, higher
                   immigrant proportions, and more generous immigrant
                   access to social services. Each of these conditions
                   aggravates competition between immigrants and
                   natives, and hence native hostility, in these
                   communities while employer support for immigration
                   usually diminishes. Yet national politicians may
                   ignore changes in the demand for immigration control
                   unless these constituencies are also able to swing a
                   national election from one party to another. The
                   larger and less ``safe'' the local constituencies,
                   the greater their influence in this sense. Evidence

To understand policy outcomes, we analyse the patterns and determinants of voters' opinions on immigration. We find that, across countries of different income levels, only a small minority of voters favour more open policies. Furthermore, our analysis supports the role played by economic channels in shaping public opinion. We next investigate how attitudes translate into policy outcomes, considering two alternative frameworks: the median voter and the interest groups model. On the one hand, the very low percentages of voters favouring immigration are, in light of the existing restrictive policies, consistent with the median voter framework. At the same time, given the extent of opposition to immigration that appears in public opinion, it is somewhat surprising in a median voter framework that immigration takes place at all.

Exploiting IRCA's introduction and differences across metropolitan areas in program intensity, we estimate that each IRCA-legalized Mexican was responsible for the subsequent immigration and legal admission of one relative -- in total -- through 2019. Most sponsored relatives were immediate family, and the adult sponsorship rate is inconsistent with out-of-control chain migration. Estimates using cross-country variation are substantively similar and suggest limited demand for reunification of extended families.},

The first part of the survey offers a broad introduction to, overview and analysis of regularisation programmes through a review of available literature on the topic. The second part of the survey is an in-depth analysis of regularisation programmes in nine countries, and provides for each country a brief overview of their current migration policy, legal channels of immigration into the country, and the undocumented population in relation to the country's demographic profile. In order to provide a complete picture of each programme, throughout the survey an attempt has been made to draw on government, non-governmental and academic sources.},

We exploit a natural experiment in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close to the Turkish coast experienced a sudden and massive increase in refugee arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did not. Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives' hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.},

                   rapidly more diverse. Yet attempts to extend racial
                   threat hypotheses to today's immigrants have
                   generated inconsistent results. This article develops
                   the politicized places hypothesis, an alternative
                   that focuses on how national and local conditions
                   interact to construe immigrants as threatening.
                   Hostile political reactions to neighboring immigrants
                   are most likely when communities undergo sudden
                   influxes of immigrants and when salient national
                   rhetoric reinforces the threat. Data from several
                   sources, including twelve geocoded surveys from 1992
                   to 2009, provide consistent support for this
                   approach. Time-series cross-sectional and panel data
                   allow the analysis to exploit exogenous shifts in
                   salient national issues such as the September 11
                   attacks, reducing the problem of residential
                   self-selection and other threats to validity. The

Instead, we find that fundamental characteristics of the voting population were key drivers of the Vote Leave share, in particular their education profiles, their historical dependence on manufacturing employment as well as low income and high unemployment. At the much finer level of wards within cities, we find that areas with deprivation in terms of education, income and employment were more likely to vote Leave. Our results indicate that a higher turnout of younger voters, who were more likely to vote Remain, would not have overturned the referendum result. We also compare our UK results to voting patterns for the far-right leader Marine Le Pen in the 2017 French presidential election. We find similar factors driving the French vote.

In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters' exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04).

That literature shows that the wage impact must be measured by carefully matching the skills of the immigrants with those of the incumbent workforce. Given that at least 60% of the Marielitos were high school dropouts, this article specifically examines the wage impact for this low-skill group. This analysis overturns the prior finding that the Mariel boatlift did not affect Miami's wage structure.

They also show that conflicting findings on the labor market effects of other important refugee waves are caused by spurious correlation in some analyses between the instrument and the endogenous variable, introduced by applying a common divisor to both.

Soldiers are randomly assigned to rooms with or without ethnic minorities. At the end of the recruit period, we measure trust by using a trust game. Results indicate that close personal contact with minorities increases trust towards a generic immigrant. We replicate the result that individuals coming from more ethnically diverse areas trust minorities less, but random assignment to interact with minority soldiers removes this negative correlation. We conclude that social integration involving personal contact can reduce negative effects of ethnic diversity on trust.},

@article{Bloemraad.et.al.2014,
	abstract = {Across immigrant-receiving democracies, ``multiculturalism'' has come under assault by political decision-makers and commentators. The academic debate, while less fiery, is also heated. We start by outlining the multiple meanings of ``multiculturalism'': a term for demographic diversity; a political philosophy of equality or justice; a set of policies to recognize and accommodate ethno-racial and religious diversity; or a public discourse recognizing and valorizing pluralism. We then review the existing empirical literature and offer some new statistical analyses to assess what we know about the harm or benefits of multicultural policies, focusing on sociopolitical outcomes. We conclude that multicultural policies appear to have some modest positive effects on sociopolitical integration for first-generation immigrants and likely little direct effect, positive or negative, on those in the second generation. On the question of majority backlash, the limited scholarship is mixed; we speculate that multiculturalism works best in places where both minorities and majority residents see it as part of a common national project. We end by considering the conditions under which this happens and whether there are distinctions between ``Anglo-settler'' and other countries.},

It presents comparative data on integration policies and welfare-state regimes. The expectations derived from this comparative policy analysis are tested with cross-national data on integration outcomes regarding labour market participation, spatial segregation and incarceration. The results suggest that multicultural policies---which grant immigrants easy access to equal rights and do not provide strong incentives for host-country language acquisition and interethnic contacts---when combined with a generous welfare state, have produced low levels of labour market participation, high levels of segregation and a strong overrepresentation of immigrants among those convicted for criminal behaviour. Sweden, Belgium and the Netherlands, which have combined multicultural policies with a strong welfare state, display relatively poor integration outcomes. Countries that either had more restrictive or assimilationist integration policies (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France) or a relatively lean welfare state (the United Kingdom) have achieved better integration results. These differences are highly consistent across the three domains of integration that are examined, with the exception of segregation rates in the United Kingdom.},

                   citizenship policy, we lack reliable evidence that
                   isolates the causal effect of naturalization from the
                   nonrandom selection into naturalization. We exploit
                   the quasi-random assignment of citizenship in Swiss
                   municipalities that used referendums to decide on
                   naturalization applications of immigrants. Comparing
                   otherwise similar immigrants who narrowly won or lost
                   their naturalization referendums, we find that
                   receiving Swiss citizenship strongly improved
                   long-term social integration. We also find that the
                   integration returns to naturalization are larger for

                   naturalization occurs earlier, rather than later in

Despite intense public debate, there is little systematic evidence on how such policies influence the behavior of the religious minorities they target. In this paper, we use rich quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the effects of the 2004 French headscarf ban on the socioeconomic integration of French Muslim women. We find that the law reduces the secondary educational attainment of Muslim girls and affects their trajectory in the labor market and family composition in the long run. We provide evidence that the ban operates through increased perceptions of discrimination and that it strengthens both national and religious identities.},

We document the persistence and transmission of the Soviet unconventional gender norms, both vertically across generations of immigrants, and horizontally through neighborhood and school peer effects. Tracking the educational and occupational choices of a cohort of young Israeli women, we identify the persistence of two important features of the Soviet culture: the prioritization of science and technology, and the strong female attachment to paid-work. Women born in the FSU, who immigrated in infancy, are significantly more likely than natives and other immigrants to major in STEM in high school. In tertiary education, they remain over-represented in STEM, but also differ significantly from other women by their specific avoidance of study fields leading to "pink collar" jobs, such as education and social work. They also display a specific choice of work-life balance reflecting a greater commitment to paid-work. Finally, the choice patterns of native women shift towards STEM and away from traditional female study fields as the share of FSU immigrants in their lower-secondary school increases.},
